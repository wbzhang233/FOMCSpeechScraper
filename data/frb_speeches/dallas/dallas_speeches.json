            "content": "Economic Conditions and the Path of\nMonetary Policy\n\nRobert S. Kaplan\n\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jackson Crawford, Jim Dolmas, Marc Giannoni,\nDrew Johnson, Lutz Kilian, Evan Koenig, Karel Mertens, Anthony Murphy, Pia Orrenius, Alex Richter,\nKathy Thacker, Jesse Thompson, Joe Tracy and Mark Wynne.\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and the Path of Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nIn the September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Committee left the\nfederal funds rate target range unchanged at 0 to 0.25 percent. The Committee also said that it\n“expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have\nreached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and\ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”\nI dissented from this statement because, while I expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal\nfunds rate in the current range until the economy is on track to achieve the Committee’s dualmandate objectives, I believe that the Committee should retain greater policy rate flexibility\nbeyond that point. In this regard, I believe that the difference between remaining “accommodative”\nand keeping rates at zero becomes increasingly important as we approach achievement of our dualmandate objectives.\nOnce we have battled and moved beyond the COVID-19 pandemic over the next two to three\nyears, I believe the world is likely to look very different than it does today—in ways that are\npredictable and ways that are likely not predictable. I would like future Committees to have the\nflexibility to adapt to those future economic conditions so they can use their best judgment in\ndeciding on the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nIn this essay, I will discuss various economic issues, briefly explain the Fed’s new policy\nframework and discuss my views regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nThe U.S. Economy—Addressing the Pandemic\nAs a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the related shutdown, the U.S. economy contracted\napproximately 32 percent on an annualized basis in the second quarter of 2020, and the\nunemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April. 1 The U-6 measure of unemployment—which\ntakes into account the unemployed, plus workers who have given up looking for a job and those\nworking part-time who would prefer to work full-time—rose to 22.8 percent in April. 2 These\nfigures compare to a prepandemic unemployment rate of 3.5 percent and a U-6 reading of 7.0\npercent in February of this year.3\nIn response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate from a range of 1.5 to\n1.75 percent in February to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent by March. In addition, the Committee\ninitiated a program of purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) totaling at least $500 billion and at least $200 billion, respectively, at a pace appropriate to\nsupport the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS. From midMarch until the end of May, Fed holdings of Treasury securities increased $1.5 trillion and\nholdings of agency MBS increased approximately $500 billion.4 Since May, the pace of additional\npurchases has been $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of agency MBS per month.\n1\n\n\fThe Fed also lowered the rate charged to banks at the discount window from 225 basis points to\n25 basis points (reflecting a 150 basis-point reduction in the fed funds rate and a 50 basis-point\nnarrowing in the spread of the primary credit rate relative to the top of the target range) in order to\nhelp ensure banks had sufficient liquidity and the ability to lend to customers.\nIn late March, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)\nAct. This act authorized the Treasury to make equity investments in a range of liquidity and credit\nfacilities established by the Federal Reserve under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. These\nprograms were aimed at stabilizing money market funds and the markets for corporate bonds,\nasset-backed securities and municipal bonds.5 These and other actions helped to restore market\nfunctioning and helped to improve access to capital for small, mid-sized and large businesses.\nAs part of the CARES Act, Congress also authorized the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This\nprogram, administered by the Small Business Administration, allowed banks to provide forgivable\nloans to small businesses in order to maintain their payrolls, hire back employees who may have\nbeen laid off, and cover applicable overhead. The CARES Act also authorized additional\nunemployment insurance benefits and one-time cash payments which allowed millions of families\nto receive vital income support as a result of heightened unemployment amid the economic\ncontraction.\nAs a result of extraordinary efforts to limit the spread of the virus through lockdowns and\nadherence to public health protocols, the incidence of the virus declined sufficiently in April and\nMay to allow several states to begin the process of reopening their economies. It is the view of\nDallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy likely bottomed out in April and began to grow again\nin May and June.\nHowever, due to a resurgence of the virus in certain states beginning in June, the rate of growth\nslowed somewhat in July and August. Through the reimposition of targeted business closures and\nthe heightened emphasis on adherence to public health protocols of social distancing and mask\nwearing, the rate of transmission of the virus began to moderate in August and September. Even\nwith these reopening challenges, the economy has recovered faster than expected, and Dallas Fed\neconomists forecast that third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. will be\napproximately 30 percent at an annualized rate.\nThe Labor Market\nThe August headline unemployment rate stood at 8.4 percent, and the U-6 measure of\nunemployment was 14.2 percent.6 In addition, the labor force participation rate—the rate at which\nthose 16 years old and older are either employed or actively looking for work—was 61.7 percent\n(this compares with a reading of 63.4 percent in January 2020).7 However, the overall labor\nstatistics mask much greater hardship among key groups in our society. In particular, the\nunemployment rates of Blacks and Hispanics increased to 16.7 percent and 18.9 percent,\nrespectively, in April. 8 This outpaced the unemployment rate of whites, which peaked at 14.2\npercent.9 While today the unemployment rate for whites has declined to 7.3 percent, the\nunemployment rate for Blacks and Hispanics remains more elevated at 13.0 percent and 10.5\n2\n\n\fpercent, respectively.10 These disparities are indicative of how the pandemic has\ndisproportionately impacted person-to-person service sector jobs, and those with lower levels of\neducational attainment (see page 5 of this essay). These statistics reinforce the need for greater\nefforts to invest in education and skills training in order to create a stronger and more inclusive\nlabor market and help ensure that key groups of our society are not left behind in this recovery.\nConsumer Spending\nOne of the unusual aspects of this pandemic has been the mix and overall resilience of consumer\nspending. In spite of the severe damage to employment and small businesses since the start of the\npandemic, we have seen that consumer spending on goods has been very strong. While goods\nspending has exceeded prepandemic levels since June, we are seeing that spending on services has\nimproved but is still below prepandemic levels.\nThe strength in consumer goods spending is significantly different from prior recessions. In past\nrecessions, consumer spending on services has typically remained steady while durable goods\nconsumption has declined. Dallas Fed economists believe that the resilience of consumer spending\nduring this pandemic has been bolstered by a substantial level of fiscal relief, particularly in the\nform of one-time payments and supplemental unemployment benefits. As a result, aggregate\npersonal income levels have actually exceeded pre-COVID levels, 11 something unique to this\nrecession. Of course, a key risk we are watching carefully is the potential waning of unemployment\nbenefits and other forms of fiscal relief, which could cause more typical recessionary dynamics to\nemerge. The emergence of these dynamics would certainly create headwinds for continued\nrecovery.\nThe Outlook\nDallas Fed economists expect continued growth through the rest of this year. We expect that 2020\nGDP will show a contraction of approximately 3.0 percent and that the unemployment rate will\nend the year at approximately 7.5 percent. Inflation, as measured by core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE), is expected to be running at approximately 1.6 percent by year-end 2020.12\nWe forecast that the U.S. economy will grow by roughly 3.5 percent in 2021 and that the\nunemployment rate will decline to approximately 5.7 percent by year-end 2021. Inflation is\nexpected to modestly accelerate, increasing to approximately 1.8 percent by year-end 2021. These\nforecasts are, of course, highly uncertain because they are heavily dependent on the path of the\nvirus and the level of adherence to public health protocols, such as mask wearing and social\ndistancing. They also depend heavily on continued fiscal support, as well as the timing of a\npotential vaccine that is effective and can be widely administered.\nTracking Mobility and Engagement\nA primary determinant of the rate of growth for the remainder of this year and next year will be\nthe incidence of the virus. In order to monitor the impact of the virus on the economy, we track\nmobility through a metric called the Dallas Fed Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI). This index\ncombines several different measures of the spatial behavior of anonymized cellphone users in order\n3\n\n\fto gauge the level of engagement of the population in a wide range of activities. This measure has\nallowed our economists to gain real-time insight into the economic impact of the pandemic. The\nMEI is measured daily, at the national, state and county levels.13\nThe U.S. measure of this index stood at +3 in the week ended Feb. 29. It began to deteriorate\nsharply in the week ended March 14. It bottomed out at -100 in the week ended April 11 and then\nbegan to improve substantially in late April. The index continued to improve sharply until midJune (with a reading of approximately -40) and then began to stall out as COVID cases surged in\nthe southern and western portions of the U.S. Since August, this measure has shown modest\nimprovement, and it currently sits at approximately -38. Chart 1 tracks the progression of this index\nin the U.S. since late-February 2020.\n\nIt is our view that this MEI measure is a good proxy for the direct impact of the pandemic on\neconomic activity and highlights trends in the economy. Dallas Fed economists believe that the\nMEI is highly correlated with the path of the virus, especially when cases are rising. This index\nhighlights the importance of limiting the spread of the virus while maintaining or improving the\nlevel of mobility. Our effectiveness in managing this virus will continue to be a primary\ndeterminant of economic growth in the U.S. How well do we follow health protocols of social\ndistancing and mask wearing? Will there be a vaccine which can be widely distributed? These\nquestions will help determine how quickly we return to higher levels of engagement and, as a\nconsequence, how fast we recover from this pandemic.\n\n4\n\n\fStructural Changes in the U.S. Economy: Demographics, Productivity and TechnologyEnabled Disruption\nIn the months and years leading up to the pandemic, I spoke regularly about some of the key\nstructural challenges facing the U.S. economy (see the essay “Economic Conditions and the Key\nStructural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook,” Oct. 10, 2019). Sluggish workforce growth\ndue to aging of the population has created a headwind for GDP growth. Finding ways to improve\nworkforce growth is likely to be critical to improving GDP growth in the U.S. Sluggish\nproductivity growth has also created headwinds to economic growth. Our economists believe that\naddressing lagging early-childhood literacy, improving educational attainment levels, beefing up\nskills training across the U.S. and creating more access to broadband as well as other targeted\ninfrastructure investments are likely to be key structural changes necessary to improve\nproductivity. These investments will particularly help to improve the future adaptability and\nemployability of those with lower levels of educational attainment.\nWe have seen in this pandemic that job losses have disproportionately impacted those with lower\nlevels of educational attainment. In April, at the height of the pandemic, those individuals with\nless than a high school diploma had an unemployment rate of approximately 21.2 percent, while\nthose who had completed college with a bachelor’s degree had an unemployment rate of\napproximately 8.4 percent.14 This disparity reflects the fact that those with lower levels of\neducational attainment may be more likely to be employed in person-to-person service sector jobs\nand, as a consequence, are less likely to be able to work remotely.15 As a result, these workers\nhave been much more vulnerable to job losses and losses of income. In a world where technology\nand technology-enabled disruption is accelerating, improving the adaptability of lower-income\nworkers is likely to be a major challenge.\nThe emphasis on remote work and engagement has meant that people are spending their time and\ntheir money in dramatically different ways than before. They are far more likely to be conducting\nmeetings remotely, traveling less, buying goods online and having their purchases of goods\ndelivered. This acceleration in the rate of technology and technology-enabled disruption is\nchanging the competitive landscape in a wide range of industries. Some of these changes may\nreverse after we have weathered this pandemic, while others are likely to be more lasting.\nAs was the case leading up to the pandemic, this trend is likely limiting the pricing power of\nbusinesses. To respond to this trend, businesses are investing substantially more in technology to\nreplace people, lower their costs and improve their competitiveness. This trend is evidenced by the\nincreasing percentage of nonresidential fixed investment accounted for by investments in computer\nand peripheral equipment, and spending on software.\nEnergy Developments\nI have spoken throughout this year about the enormous challenges the coronavirus has posed for\nthe U.S. energy industry. In early March, after OPEC-plus failed to reach an agreement on\nproduction cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut its selling prices and increase its crude\noil production. This retaliatory announcement was coincident with the beginning stages of an\n5\n\n\funprecedented decline in global oil demand as a result of COVID. These events have had\nsignificant negative implications for U.S. oil production.\nIt is the view of our energy economists that U.S. oil production will decline from approximately\n12.8 million barrels per day (mb/d) in December 2019 to approximately 10.7 mb/d by December\n2020.16 Oil production from the Permian Basin is expected to decline from approximately 4.7 mb/d\nin December 2019 to approximately 3.8 mb/d in December 2020.17 Consistent with this, the\nnumber of oil wells completed is projected to fall 50 percent from 2019 to 2020, and overall U.S.\nexploration-and-development capital spending will likely decline by approximately 50 percent in\n2020.18\nOur economists believe that U.S. oil production growth will likely be flat during 2021. This\nforecast assumes that new drilling and well completions will be sufficient to replace declining\nproduction from existing wells.\nGlobal energy consumption fell to approximately 83 mb/d in the second quarter, a decline of nearly\n17 percent from prepandemic levels.19 During the subsequent recovery, consumption has risen to\nnearly 90 mb/d.20 Of course, future levels of demand will be heavily impacted by the timing of\nwhen individuals increase their engagement in a broader range of transportation activities,\nincluding the extent to which they return to airline travel. Balancing this weakness in demand with\na substantial decline in production, it is the view of Dallas Fed energy economists that global\nexcess oil inventories will not be worked off before late 2021.\nThe Fed’s New Monetary Policy Framework\nOn Aug. 27, the Federal Reserve announced amendments to its monetary policy framework.21 This\nannouncement was the culmination of a two-year review of its policy framework, which involved\nthree distinct components. First, the Federal Reserve hosted a series of Fed Listens events across\nthe country to engage various stakeholders to hear directly from them about how monetary policy\ndecisions affect their communities. Second, the Federal Reserve convened a research conference\nat which prominent academic experts addressed economic topics central to the review. Finally,\nover the course of several meetings, the Committee explored a range of issues that were brought\nto light during the review. In its new framework, the FOMC made key changes with regard to both\nparts of its dual mandate—maximum employment and price stability.\nOn maximum employment, the FOMC emphasized that maximum employment is a broad-based\nand inclusive goal and reported that its policy decisions would be informed by its “assessments of\nthe shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.” The original document referred to\n“deviations from its maximum level.” The previous expansion demonstrated the benefits of a\nstrong labor market and the difficulty of assessing the level of maximum employment in real time.\nUnemployment fell to levels previously thought to be unsustainable, and we were able to bring in\nmany workers who had previously been left behind. This occurred against the backdrop of\nrelatively muted inflation. Based on this experience, the Committee decided to change the policy\nframework to signal that higher employment, in the absence of unwanted increases in inflation or\nthe emergence of other risks, will not by itself be a cause for policy concern.\n6\n\n\fOn price stability, the FOMC adjusted its strategy for achieving its longer-run inflation goal of 2\npercent by noting that it “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.” The revised\npolicy states that “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent,\nappropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time.” This change was made in an effort to ensure that inflation expectations do not drift\ndown over time and that they remain well-anchored at 2 percent. If inflation expectations were to\ndrift lower, the nominal level of interest rates would be lower, too, leaving less room for the FOMC\nto cut rates when needed to support the economy.\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nThe September FOMC Decision\nIn light of the economic devastation caused by the virus and related lockdowns, I believe it has\nbeen appropriate for the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary actions to stabilize markets and to\nimprove access to capital for small, mid-sized and large businesses. In addition, I believe it has\nbeen appropriate for the Fed to maintain the setting of the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 percent\nand to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to support the smooth\nfunctioning of these markets and to provide some additional level of accommodation during the\npandemic.\nIn my September meeting dissent, I emphasized that I believe the current setting of the federal\nfunds rate will be appropriate until the Committee is confident that the economy has weathered\nthe pandemic and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as\narticulated by the new policy framework. My best judgment is that it will take at least until late\n2022 or sometime in 2023 for these criteria to be met. However, beyond that point, I believe that\nthe Committee should retain greater policy rate flexibility to decide on the appropriate stance of\nmonetary policy.\nAccommodative Versus Zero—The Role of R*\nThere is an important difference between remaining “accommodative” and keeping rates at zero.\nI believe, after we have fully weathered this crisis, we should be willing to be more accommodative\nthan in the past in order to create a stronger and more inclusive labor market and make progress\non achieving our 2 percent average inflation target. However, I am cognizant that as the economy\napproaches full employment and we are on track to reach our price stability objectives, the\nequilibrium nominal rate of interest (the federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither\nrestrictive nor accommodative—often referred to as R*) is likely to increase. This means that as\nwe approach achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, the stance of monetary policy will\nactually become more accommodative if the fed funds rate were to remain at zero. I can understand\nwhy future Committees will want to remain accommodative at that point in order to ensure we\nachieve our goals, but will they want to be effectively increasing the level of accommodation by\nkeeping the federal funds rate at zero? I would like future Committees to have the flexibility to\nmake this judgment.\n7\n\n\fMonitoring Excessive Risk Taking\nI believe there are real costs to keeping rates at zero for a prolonged period of time. Keeping rates\nat zero can adversely impact savers, encourage excessive risk taking and create distortions in\nfinancial markets. Excessive risk taking and distortions in financial markets could lead to greater\nfragilities, excesses and imbalances which could ultimately jeopardize the attainment of the Fed’s\nobjectives. These fragilities and tail risks are often much easier to recognize in hindsight than in\nreal time. For example, some market observers have commented that the seizing up of financial\nmarkets in March was due in part to COVID and related shutdowns but may have also been due,\nin part, to some amount of forced selling by over-risked market participants. While the Federal\nReserve has oversight and visibility regarding banks in the U.S., it does not have supervisory\njurisdiction or a high level of visibility regarding the nonbank financial markets.\nAdapting to a Changing World\nThe post-COVID economy is likely to look very different from the economy we are in today. I am\nreluctant to restrict the ability of future Committees to use their best judgment to adapt to these\nchanges in ways they believe help achieve our dual-mandate objectives. Future Committees will\nneed to assess the implications of acceleration in the rate of new technology adoption and\ntechnology-enabled disruption, changes in our views regarding how monetary policy impacts\ninflation, changes in tax policy, changes in regulatory policy, changes in trade policy, the role of\nthe dollar as the world’s reserve currency, and other developments—some foreseeable and some\nthat are hard to predict as we sit here today. One of the great strengths of the FOMC is the gathering\nof a diverse group of decision-makers who are empowered to share views, energetically debate\nand ultimately use their best judgment, based on analyses of current and expected economic\nconditions, in order to make sound policy decisions that are forward looking.\nFor example, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated investment by for-profit and not-for-profit\nenterprises in technology and the adoption of new models that accelerate the trend of technologyenabled disruption. These trends are likely to continue to mute the pricing power of businesses.\nThe expected strengthening of this structural trend may well offset the cyclical inflationary impact\nof a tightening job market. It is unclear to me how these structural forces will interact with the\ncyclical forces in impacting inflation in the years ahead. In addition, I believe that we will learn a\nlot over the next two years about the impact of monetary policy on achieving our inflation goals,\nand I believe more research needs to be done on pricing dynamics and technology-enabled\ndisruption.\nThe Rationale for Forward Guidance\nForward guidance is communication by the Fed which indicates its intentions regarding the likely\nfuture path of monetary policy. It can be a powerful tool that comes with potential benefits and\ncosts. A commitment to keeping rates at zero based on certain conditions being met can, in\nprinciple, help lower today’s longer-term yields and, thus, provide additional stimulus that could\naccelerate the economy’s return toward our longer-run goals. However, I am skeptical about the\n8\n\n\fbenefits of enhanced forward guidance at the moment because rates are already historically low\nand, even before this meeting, market expectations were for them to stay low for the next few\nyears. In addition, the latest FOMC Summary of Economic Projections indicated that the bulk of\nFOMC participants expect the federal funds rate to remain at 0 to 0.25 percent through the end of\n2023. Given these expectations, it was my preference to defer using enhanced forward guidance\nas a tool until a time in the future when the benefits would be more compelling.\nLooking Forward\nI believe that, today, our primary focus should be on fighting the COVID pandemic and getting\nthe U.S. economy on track to meet our dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price\nstability. This means keeping the federal funds rate at its current setting, continuing our 13(3)\nprograms until we judge that they are no longer required, and considering use of other tools. In\naddition, I believe there needs to be continued focus on doing more to help small and mid-sized\nbusinesses get access to capital.\nWhile monetary policy will play a critical role in the recovery, we will also need additional fiscal\nmeasures that provide relief to the unemployed and those working part time who would prefer to\nwork full time. In addition, fiscal relief would be highly beneficial to state and local governments\nthat are trying to recover from a fiscal hole created in the first and second quarters of this year.\nLack of additional fiscal relief would create a key downside risk to my economic forecast for 2020\nand 2021.\nWhile appropriate monetary and fiscal policies are critical to recovery, a primary determinant of\nthe rate of recovery will be how well we manage the virus—particularly, wearing masks, social\ndistancing and rigorously following other public health protocols. In addition, we must continue\nto invest in the development of widespread, rapid and accurate testing as well as work to beef up\nour ability to do effective contact tracing. Even with an effective vaccine, which will hopefully be\napproved in the next several months, these measures are likely to be vital until we are able to\nconfidently inoculate the bulk of the population.\nI remain confident that the U.S. economy will recover from the COVID crisis as each of us\ncontinues to do our part. I am also confident that the Federal Reserve will do all that it can to make\nsure we successfully recover from this pandemic and move the economy forward toward achieving\nour full employment and price stability goals.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nData are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), published Aug. 27, 2020, and from the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics (BLS) as of August 2020.\n2\nAs of August 2020.

Kaplan\nFebruary 18, 2020\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to leave the\nfederal funds rate unchanged in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. In addition, we made a 5-basis-point upward\nadjustment to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) held by banks on deposit at the Fed. This was a technical\nadjustment intended to support the setting of the federal funds rate well within the range set by the FOMC.\nI supported these decisions as well as the post-meeting communication regarding the path of the Federal Reserve\nbalance sheet. The Fed balance sheet expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2019 as repurchase agreement (repo)\noperations and Treasury bills purchases were needed to maintain reserve levels.\nIt is my hope and expectation that, as reserves in the banking system meet or exceed ample levels of at least $1.5\ntrillion, the Fed balance sheet will expand only gradually to reﬂect trend growth in the demand for currency and other\nFederal Reserve liabilities. I would expect that, over the ﬁrst half of 2020, the pace of balance sheet expansion will\nmoderate signiﬁcantly as active repo operations gradually decline and reserve management purchases of Treasury\nbills slow in the second quarter.\nI continue to support a review of our supervisory guidance and regulatory policies in an eﬀort to assess whether we\ncould put Treasury bills and reserves on a more equal footing in terms of bank liquidity management. I also remain\nopen to consideration of other alternatives which could help the Fed run an ample reserves regime with a sensitivity\nto limiting growth in the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nIn this essay, I will brieﬂy discuss my outlook for the U.S. and global economies. In addition, I will explore the impact of\nthese and other developments on the outlook for the energy industry. Lastly, I will describe my views on the current stance\nof monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nIt is the base-case view of Dallas Fed economists that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at a rate of\napproximately 2 to 2.25 percent in 2020. This forecast is based on our expectation that global growth is likely to\nremain sluggish but will show signs of stabilization due to some calming of trade uncertainties—particularly as a\nresult of the ratiﬁcation of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the Phase One agreement with China, and\nsome greater clarity regarding Brexit. In this regard, we also expect U.S. manufacturing to remain sluggish but show\nsome signs of stabilization. Lastly, we expect business ﬁxed investment to ﬁrm somewhat from disappointing levels\nin 2019. These developments, combined with a strong U.S. consumer (which accounts for approximately 70 percent\nof U.S. GDP), should lead to solid growth in 2020.\nOf course, this outlook is clouded by the impact of the coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. This development will\nlikely mean slower growth in China and risks to the downside for global growth. Dallas Fed economists are\nconsidering various alternative scenarios for how this virus could impact U.S. and global GDP growth. However, at\nthis stage, it is still too soon to predict with conﬁdence the ultimate impact of this virus on the U.S. and global\neconomies. Our Dallas Fed team will continue to actively monitor this situation and assess its ongoing implications.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2020/0218.aspx\n\n1/7\n\n\f1/20/2021\n\nAn Assessment of Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy - Dallasfed.org\n\nIn addition, I am cognizant that the delay in production of the Boeing 737 Max airplane is likely to reduce U.S. GDP\ngrowth by as much as 0.4 percent (annualized) in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020. The extent of the full-year eﬀect will\nultimately be determined by the timing of a return to production, likely later in the year. Finally, the ﬁrst half of 2020\nwill beneﬁt from the return of post-strike production at General Motors.\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. consumer continues to be the key underpinning of the U.S. economy. Household debt\nto GDP has gone from a peak of 98 percent in 2008 to approximately 74 percent as of third quarter 2019.[1] In\naddition to this improvement in household balance sheets, the current rate of unemployment in the U.S. is\napproximately 3.6 percent.[2] Furthermore, the U-6 measure of unemployment—which takes into account the\nunemployed, plus discouraged workers who have given up looking for work, plus workers who work part time but\nwould prefer to work full time—is currently running at approximately 6.9 percent.[3] This reading is near its historic\nlow of 6.7 percent reached in December 2019. The labor force participation rate (the percentage of 16 year olds and\nabove either employed or actively looking for work) now stands at 63.4 percent, its highest level since June 2013.[4]\nAll this suggests to Dallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy is likely at or past the level of full employment. This\nfurther bolsters our near-term conﬁdence in the strength of the U.S. consumer.\nBased on our forecast, we would expect headline unemployment to drift down from the current reading of 3.6\npercent to approximately 3.5 percent during 2020. In addition, Dallas Fed economists believe that the personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) inﬂation rate will gradually move toward the Fed’s 2 percent target in the medium\nterm. This conﬁdence is bolstered by the fact that the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inﬂation, which\nexes out inﬂation components with extreme moves to the upside or the downside, is currently running at\napproximately 2 percent on a 12-month basis.[5] Our research indicates that the trimmed mean is a good indicator of\nfuture headline PCE inﬂation trends.\n\nPotential GDP Growth\nExpected 2020 growth of 2 to 2.25 percent is in line with the average growth rate of the U.S. economy since 2010.[6]\nHowever, this level of growth is sluggish by historical standards. GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce\nplus growth in productivity. As I’ve discussed in previous essays, aging demographics and sluggish workforce growth\n(Chart 1) and more modest productivity growth (Chart 2) are negatively impacting potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2020/0218.aspx\n\n2/7\n\n\f1/20/2021\n\nAn Assessment of Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy - Dallasfed.org\n\nThe rate of U.S. workforce growth has declined from a yearly average of approximately 2.71 percent in the 1970s to\n1.27 percent in the 1990s to an expected 0.24 percent in the 2020s.[7] This deceleration in workforce growth is not\nbeing oﬀset by improvements in productivity per worker. The rate of U.S. productivity growth has declined from a\nyearly average of almost 2 percent in the 1990s to 0.85 percent since 2010.[8]\nIt’s the view of Dallas Fed economists that structural reforms are needed if we are to improve U.S. workforce growth.\nThese reforms could include policies that facilitate child care and transportation services, which make it easier for\nmarginally attached workers to enter and stay in the workforce. In addition, immigration reform that focuses on skills\nand employer needs could also help increase the rate of U.S. workforce growth.\nProductivity growth could be enhanced by policies that help workers impacted by technology and technology-enabled\ndisruption to get reskilled. Dallas Fed economists believe that the emphasis on skills training programs could be\ndramatically increased in the U.S. In addition, policies that focus on improving early-childhood literacy and the overall\nmath, science and reading skills of our next generation of workers would help improve their adaptability and\nproductivity. Lastly, investments in selected infrastructure improvements could help create greater eﬃciencies in the\nU.S. economy.\nWe would also note that, in this context, global trade is likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster. In particular,\nintegrated logistics and supply-chain arrangements, especially those with Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Canada have\nbeen critical to improving the global competiveness of U.S. ﬁrms, which has allowed these ﬁrms to add jobs and\ndomicile their businesses in the U.S.\nFinding ways to improve the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy is critical given that the amount of U.S.\ngovernment debt held by the public is now approximately 79 percent of GDP[9] and the present value of unfunded\nentitlements is now approximately $59 trillion.[10]\nWhile monetary policy has a key role to play in enhancing the ability of the U.S. economy to grow at its potential, it is\nnot a substitute for structural reforms and policies that can improve the level of potential growth in the U.S. As a\ncentral banker, I believe it is important to point out the limits of monetary policy and the need for broader policies to\nimprove the economic future of the U.S. (See the essay “Economic Conditions and the Key Structural Drivers\nImpacting the Economic Outlook,” Oct. 10, 2019, which discusses these structural challenges and opportunities).\n\nEnergy\nOil Industry Outlook\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2020/0218.aspx\n\n3/7\n\n\f1/20/2021\n\nAn Assessment of Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy - Dallasfed.org\n\nThe Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is home to the Permian Basin, which accounts for approximately 36\npercent of U.S. crude oil production.[11], [12] Due to the emergence of the U.S. shale industry, the U.S. now produces\napproximately 12.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil.[13] This compares with crude oil production of\napproximately 11.3 mb/d by Russia and 9.7 mb/d by Saudi Arabia.[14]\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that global oil production (crude oil and liquids) will increase by 0.7 mb/d to\napproximately 102.3 mb/d from fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2020.[15] This production forecast assumes\ngrowth of 0.7 mb/d in the U.S. and 0.7 mb/d in other non-OPEC countries, and a decline of 0.7 mb/d in OPEC oil\nproduction.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global consumption will likely grow by approximately 1.0 mb/d to\n102.2 mb/d in 2020.[16] The coronavirus presents a meaningful risk to demand growth globally as overall Chinese oil\nconsumption represented approximately 14 percent of total global consumption and approximately 57 percent of\nglobal consumption growth in 2019.[17] The IEA consumption forecast indicates that, due to the impact of the virus,\nﬁrst quarter 2020 global oil demand will decline by approximately 0.4 mb/d versus the ﬁrst quarter of 2019. It further\nassumes that a substantial portion of this consumption decline will reverse in subsequent quarters of 2020. It is\nworth noting that the expected ﬁrst-quarter consumption decline would be the ﬁrst year-over-year drop in quarterly\noil demand since the Great Recession of 2007–09.\nIn this context, Dallas Fed economists expect U.S. crude oil production growth of approximately 0.4 mb/d in 2020.[18]\nThis compares with production growth of 2.0 mb/d in 2018 and 0.9 mb/d in 2019.[19] These forecasts assume West\nTexas Intermediate oil prices stay in the range of approximately $50 to $60 per barrel.\nThis expected decline in U.S. production growth is inﬂuenced by weaker global demand growth and is also heavily\ninﬂuenced by a dramatic increase in pressure from capital providers to see “discipline” in capital allocation from\nenergy and production ﬁrms. In practice, this means that capital expenditures for drilling activity will have to be\nfunded by internal cash ﬂow versus debt issuance. This is a fairly signiﬁcant change from historic practice. It should\nbe noted that shale projects are more “short-cycle” investments than typical conventional projects—they can be\ndrilled and brought onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8 million per well.\nHowever, as output of wells tends to decline rapidly in the ﬁrst few years of production, producers must continuously\ninvest in order to maintain overall production levels.\nAs a result of these developments, our Dallas Fed oil industry contacts have indicated to us that they expect capital\nspending in the U.S. oil and gas sector could be down by as much as 10 to 15 percent in 2020. This reduction in\ncapital spending is likely to have a substantial impact on energy service companies. Several companies have already\nannounced restructurings, charge-oﬀs and layoﬀs. In light of this, we would expect that 2020 will be a year of\nrestructurings, consolidation where possible, and general belt tightening.\n\nImplications for Texas and the U.S. Economy\nDespite a more challenging environment for oil and gas production, Dallas Fed economists still expect 2020 job\ngrowth in Texas to be approximately 2.1 percent.[20] While the state’s economy has grown substantially and become\nmuch more diversiﬁed over the past several decades, the energy sector still represents approximately 9 percent of\nTexas GDP[21] and remains a key economic driver in a number of important regions of the state.\nIn the U.S. more broadly, lower oil prices should beneﬁt U.S. consumers by freeing up more of their disposable\nincome for the consumption of non-oil goods and services. However, because the U.S. is no longer a net importer of\noil and petroleum products, the beneﬁt to U.S. GDP of lower oil prices for consumers may be increasingly oﬀset by\nthe negative impact on domestic energy producers in terms of capital spending and employee compensation.\nChanges in oil prices will increasingly redistribute income between sectors and states within the U.S., as opposed to\nimpacting the transfer of income between the U.S. and other oil-exporting nations.\nAs a result of these developments, over the past several years, the U.S. has become somewhat less sensitive than in\nthe past to oil price ﬂuctuations. Additionally, since the 1970s, the U.S. economy has become less oil-intensive due to\nsubstitution for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel eﬃciency, and growth in the less-energy-intensive\nservices sector as a share of the overall economy.\n\nGrowth in Renewables\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2020/0218.aspx\n\n4/7\n\n\f1/20/2021\n\nAn Assessment of Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy - Dallasfed.org\n\nDallas Fed energy economists expect that global energy consumption will increasingly reﬂect reduced reliance on\nfossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) as a share of total consumption. This reduced reliance is primarily due to\nexpected growth in renewable energy. Renewable energy sources include hydropower, solar power, wind power\n(oﬀshore and onshore), geothermal and modern bioenergy production (including energy content in solid, liquid and\ngaseous products derived from biomass feedstocks and biogas). While estimates of the increase in renewable energy\nproduction vary, there is clear evidence that a transition is underway in the energy industry.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) base-case forecast suggests that renewables are likely to substantially increase\nas a percentage of global energy consumption over the next 20 years.[22] Their forecast indicates that, under stated\npolicies, renewables will grow approximately 125 percent over the period, outpacing global oil and natural gas\nconsumption growth of approximately 21 percent.[23] However, the IEA notes that if global regulators take a much\nmore aggressive stance to achieve the energy-related goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development agenda,\n[24] it estimates that renewables could grow by over 200 percent and global oil and natural gas consumption could\ndecline by as much as 20 percent by 2040.[25] In that case, renewables would account for nearly 33 percent of global\nenergy consumption.[26]\nOur Eleventh District industry contacts report to us that they believe investments in sustainability and innovative\napproaches to mitigate the impacts of climate change are likely to provide substantial growth opportunities for U.S.\nbusinesses. We are already seeing a number of these investments in Texas.\n\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nIt is my view that, based on my base-case outlook for the U.S. economy, the current setting of the federal funds rate\nat 1.5 to 1.75 percent is roughly appropriate. Consistent with this view, my Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nsubmission in December 2019 indicated that I expected no movement in the federal funds rate through 2020.\nOf course, my views are subject to revision based on how the outlook for the U.S. economy evolves over the course of\nthis year. In that regard, I will be closely monitoring a variety of economic developments and, in particular, continuing\nto assess how the coronavirus ultimately will impact the U.S. and global economies.\n\nNotes\n1.

Kaplan\n\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve cut the\nfederal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. I supported this rate cut as\nwell as the previous rate cut in July.\nIn addition, since mid-September, the New York Fed has announced a series of overnight and term\nrepurchase agreement (repo) operations intended to provide additional liquidity to the overnight\nand term lending markets in order to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range. In the\npost-FOMC meeting press conference, Chairman Powell suggested that the Fed will consider\nadditional actions in order to provide sufficient reserves consistent with our decision to implement\npolicy in an ample-reserves regime. I do not plan to comment extensively on additional options,\nas we continue to debate and discuss them, other than to emphasize that I support more-permanent\nsteps to ensure the proper functioning of repo and other short-term funding markets. I am also\nsupportive of taking steps to adjust the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in order to help\nachieve our objective of implementing policy in an ample-reserves regime.\nIn this essay, I will briefly review economic conditions in the U.S. I will then step back and discuss\nseveral key structural drivers that I believe are critical to the prospects for economic growth in the\nU.S. Finally, I will outline my current thinking regarding the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\nEconomic Outlook for the U.S.\nDallas Fed economists forecast growth for 2019 of approximately 2.1 percent. This forecast is\nbased on estimated first-half growth of approximately 2.5 percent and an expectation for secondhalf growth of approximately 1.7 percent. This compares with a 2.5 percent rate of growth achieved\nin 2018.1\nDallas Fed economists had predicted some of the recent slowing due to the expected waning of the\nimpact of fiscal stimulus. However, some of the slowing is also due to heightened trade tensions,\nwhich have contributed, at least in part, to decelerating rates of global growth as well as weakness\nin manufacturing and business direct investment in the U.S. Despite these headwinds, U.S. growth\nhas been resilient primarily due to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for\napproximately 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The consumer is bolstered, in particular, by a\nstrong jobs market as well as improvements in the level of household debt to gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) which have occurred since 2008.2\nOn October 4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported September jobs growth of 136,000. The\ncurrent rate of unemployment is now approximately 3.5 percent.3 This is the lowest level of U.S.\nunemployment in the past 50 years. To further gauge labor market slack, Dallas Fed economists\nalso look at the U-6 measure of unemployment, which includes people who are unemployed, plus\n2\n\n\fdiscouraged workers, plus workers who are working part time but would prefer to work full time.\nThis measure now stands at approximately 6.9 percent,4 below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent\n(reached in December 2006) and only slightly above its historical low of 6.8 percent (reached in\nOctober 2000).5 These measures, as well as our Eleventh District surveys of employers and\ndiscussions with contacts, indicate that the U.S. economy is at or past the level of full employment.\nMany of our contacts report particular difficulty in hiring and retaining lower-skilled workers (who\nearn wages in a range of 12 to 15 dollars per hour), as well as finding and retaining more skilled\nworkers, who typically require some level of advanced specialized training.\nRegarding inflation, the headline measure of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation\nis currently running at 1.4 percent on a 12-month basis.6 At the Dallas Fed, we prefer to focus on\nthe Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which removes the most extreme moves\nup and down in PCE components. This measure is currently running at approximately 2 percent\non a 12-month basis.7 Dallas Fed research suggests that the trimmed mean measure of inflation is\na good indicator of future inflation trends. On that basis, it is our expectation that the headline PCE\ninflation rate will reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over the medium term.\nKey Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook\nI am often asked: Why is growth today so much slower than it was in the 1980s and the 1990s?\nWhy are market-determined interest rates so much lower? Why is the federal funds rate today so\nmuch lower than in these previous periods?\nA big part of the answer to these questions lies in the fact that there have been substantial secular\nchanges in the U.S. economy. At the Dallas Fed, we refer to these as “structural drivers.” These\nstructural drivers include:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nDemographic Trends\nTechnology, Technology-Enabled Disruption, and Education/Skills Training\nGlobalization and Trade\nThe Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\n\nOf course, there are other major trends. One of the most significant is climate change and its\nimplications for the increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events, such as hurricanes,\ndroughts, floods, and other disruptive impacts (see the essay “A Brief Discussion Regarding the\nImpact of Climate Change on Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District,” June 27, 2019). At\nthe Dallas Fed, we will continue to do research and analyze the various impacts of climate change\non the Eleventh District, as well as the U.S. and the world.\nThe following is a discussion of four primary structural drivers. Over the past several years, our\nDallas Fed economists have spent a substantial amount of time discussing these key structural\ndrivers and trying to understand their implications for economic outcomes and economic policy\ndecisions in the U.S.\n\n3\n\n\f1. Demographic Trends\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has risen from approximately 35.3\nyears in 2000 to 38.2 in 2018.8 The share of population 65 years or older has risen from 12.4\npercent in 2000 to 16.0 in 2018.9 As baby boomers increasingly leave the workforce, U.S. labor\nforce growth is slowing. Slower labor force growth is critically important because GDP growth is\nmade up of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Unless slower workforce\ngrowth is offset by improved productivity growth, U.S. GDP growth will slow. Chart 1 shows the\nongoing trends of population aging and declines in population and labor force growth rates in the\nU.S.\nChart 1\nLabor Force and Working-Age Population Growth Rates Declining over Time\nPercent change, annualized\n3.0\n\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\nPopulation, 20-64 years old\n\n2.71\n\n2.5\n2.05\n\n2.0\n\n1.95\n\n1.37\n\n1.5\n\n1.27\n\n1.16\n\n1.0\n\n1.11\n0.84\ne\n0.39e 0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.24e 0.21e\n\n0.0\n1970s\n\n1980s\n\n1990s\n\n2000s\n\n2010s\n\n2020s\n\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value (2018–2028 growth rates from Employment Projections program; 2020s estimates only through 2028).\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAnother way to look at labor force growth is to look at the labor force participation rate. This rate\nis the percentage of the population age 16 and older that either has a job or is actively looking for\nwork. This rate has decreased from approximately 66 percent in 2007 to 63.2 percent today.10\nDallas Fed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to the aging of the population.\nWe expect this measure to decline further to 61 percent over the next 10 years as the population\ncontinues to age and the rate of workforce growth continues to decelerate.11 As discussed earlier,\nthese trends create a significant headwind for GDP growth.\nLabor force growth has been a key aspect of sustained U.S. growth over the past several decades.\nIncreasing female labor force participation boosted growth from the 1950s to the 1990s. Since the\n1990s, U.S. labor force growth has been helped by older workers staying in the workforce longer.\nThroughout our history, immigration of workers has also been a key aspect of U.S. labor force\ngrowth.\n4\n\n\fThe Dallas Fed does a substantial amount of research on immigration trends. Pia Orrenius, senior\neconomist at the Dallas Fed, has pointed out that more than 50 percent of workforce growth over\nthe past 20 years has come from immigrants and their children.12 Her research indicates that\nimmigrants tend to take jobs at both the low end and the high end of the workforce and do not\nappear to have negatively impacted wages of indigenous workers overall. Her research also\nindicates that, from a policy point of view, the U.S. might be well-served to restructure its\nimmigration policies to be more employer- and skills-based. Her work suggests that if the U.S. is\nto improve workforce growth in the years ahead, immigration is likely to be a key element of this\neffort.\nIn summary, slowing workforce growth is likely to be a continuing headwind for U.S. economic\ngrowth. Finding ways to grow the workforce will be critical to improving GDP growth prospects\nfor the U.S.\n2. Technology, Technology-Enabled Disruption, and Education/Skills Training (See Appendix)\nWhile the U.S. has experienced rapid improvements in technology and substantial development of\ntechnology-enabled disruption in a variety of industries, measures of labor force productivity\ngrowth have been surprisingly sluggish. As explained earlier, GDP growth is made up of growth\nin the workforce and growth in productivity. If workforce growth is slowing due to aging of the\npopulation, it is critical that we find ways to improve productivity growth.\nOutput per worker grew on average approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.4\npercent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.1 percent since 2010.13 Our hypothesis at the\nDallas Fed is that intensifying technology and technology-enabled disruption is improving the\nproductivity of a substantial number of U.S. companies and industries. Productivity improvement\nis measured not by industry, but by improvement in average output per worker in the overall\neconomy. Part of the issue is that technological innovation may impact output per worker with a\nlag, and some believe that we may see improvements in these output statistics in the future, after\na period of adoption and adaptation. However, Dallas Fed economists also believe that a key reason\nthat we don’t see better workforce productivity data is that technological innovations are likely\nbeing experienced differently by workers based on their educational attainment and/or skill levels.\nIn particular, if you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education\nor less, and/or have a routine type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding your job is being\neither restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. Many of those workers with less\neducation may be finding that their real wages and productivity are declining in a new age in which\nskills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the jobs\nmarket.\nThe increase in technology and technology-enabled disruption is also putting a spotlight on the\nadaptive capabilities of the workforce. In particular, better educational achievement and improved\nskill levels are critical to improving workforce adaptability. Various research studies have\nhighlighted that the educational achievement and skill levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged\nthose of other developed countries. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and\n5\n\n\fmath skills.14 It also ranked 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and\nreading skills among 15-year-olds.15\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of\nMunich suggests that improvements in math and science skills could translate into meaningful\nimprovements in potential U.S. GDP growth.16\nDallas Fed economists believe that in order to address the powerful structural driver of technology\nand technology-enabled disruption, the U.S. must do more to improve early-childhood literacy,\ncollege readiness, and skills training at our high schools and community colleges. These efforts\nshould be a powerful investment in improving the quality and productivity of our human capital\nwhich, in a technological age, are essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n3. Globalization and Trade\nThe U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world’s population.17 It is estimated that the Standard and\nPoor’s 500 companies in the U.S. now generate in excess of 40 percent of their revenues from\noutside the U.S.18 In addition, in order to be globally competitive, many of our companies have\ndeveloped highly sophisticated cross-border supply-chain and logistics arrangements with Mexico\nand Canada. Dallas Fed economists believe these arrangements have helped these companies\nimprove their global competitiveness.\nDallas Fed economists have suggested that U.S. trade analysis should segment our trading\nrelationships into those which are primarily final goods versus those which are largely intermediate\ngoods. For example, the trading relationship with Mexico is predominantly intermediate goods.\nThis helps explain why approximately 40 percent of the value of U.S. imports19 from Mexico\nconsists of value added from the U.S., which is indicative of integrated supply-chain and logistics\nrelationships that have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global\ncompetitiveness.20 On the other hand, the trading relationship with China is primarily a final-goods\nrelationship (approximately 4 percent of the value of U.S. imports from China contains value\nadded from the U.S.).21 In addition, as has been much discussed, the trade relationship with China\nis fraught with issues related to technology transfer and intellectual property rights.\nWhile trade is important to the U.S., it is vital to many countries outside the U.S. Exports currently\naccount for approximately 12 percent of U.S. GDP.22 However, exports account for approximately\n47 percent of German GDP,23 20 percent of euro-area GDP24 and 27 percent of emerging-market\nGDP.25 As a result, it is not surprising that escalating trade tensions disproportionately impact nonU.S. economic growth. It is also not surprising that as trade uncertainty has risen, particularly with\nMexico and Canada, it has had some dampening impact on U.S. manufacturing and investments\nrelating to global supply-chain arrangements.\nIf your job is being disrupted or eliminated in the U.S., the recent public narrative has suggested\nthat it is probably due to globalization—either trade or immigration. Dallas Fed economists believe\nthat this disruption is more likely due to technology and/or technology-enabled disruption. Our\neconomists point out that if policymakers get this diagnosis wrong, we are likely to make policy\ndecisions which impede globalization—and the net effect is likely to be slower growth in the U.S.\n6\n\n\fThis misdiagnosis would not be so consequential if we weren’t so highly leveraged at the federal\ngovernment level.\n4. The Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at approximately 76 percent of GDP,26 and\nthe present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $59 trillion.27 The recent\ntax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues,\nand the U.S. deficit is poised to exceed $1 trillion in 2020.28 As a consequence of this rising level\nof debt, the U.S. will have less fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\nThe U.S. relies heavily on the presumption that the dollar is likely to be the world’s reserve\ncurrency for the foreseeable future. That is, global investors tend to overweight their asset\nallocations to dollars. This, of course, is highly beneficial when the projected issuance of U.S.\nTreasury securities is likely to rise substantially. However, it is worth considering the implications\nif the dollar ceases to be the world’s reserve currency sometime in the future. Is it wise for the U.S.\nto rely so heavily on this presumption in managing its financial affairs?\nPreviously, I have written about the historically elevated level of corporate debt in the U.S. I have\nnoted that this is probably not, at this point, a systemic risk but more likely an amplifier in the\nevent of an economic slowdown (see “Corporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown,”\nMarch 5, 2019). It is worth noting that high levels of government debt, along with elevated levels\nof corporate debt, mean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That\nis, increases in interest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to\nservice corporate and government debt obligations.\nStructural reforms and other actions that moderate the path of future government debt growth may\nbe advisable to keep this short-term-growth tailwind from becoming a medium- and longer-term\nheadwind to economic growth in the U.S. In the meantime, this historically high level of U.S.\ngovernment debt means that there will likely be less capacity to use fiscal policy in the event of an\neconomic downturn.\nImplications of Key Structural Drivers\nMany of the issues raised by these structural drivers are primarily outside the purview of monetary\npolicy. That is, while monetary policy has a key role to play, I believe it is likely that we will need\nbroader economic policy actions if we are to improve the growth potential of the U.S. economy\nand the future prosperity of our citizens.\nImmigration and trade policies, education reform and skills training, and managing the future path\nof U.S. government debt are all policy judgments that are made outside the purview of monetary\npolicy and the remit of the Federal Reserve. However, part of my job as a central banker at the\nDallas Fed is to share our economic research and call out these issues to elected and appointed\nofficials in hopes that our research will help inform their judgments and highlight the need for\nbroader economic policy at the city, state and federal levels. I am hopeful that this effort will help\nimprove economic performance in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n\n7\n\n\fDiscussion of the Current Stance of U.S. Monetary Policy\nAs discussed earlier, I supported the FOMC’s 25-basis-point reductions in the federal funds rate\nat the July and September meetings. I am concerned that if non-U.S. growth continues to\ndecelerate, and weakness in U.S. manufacturing and business investment intensifies, this weakness\ncould spread to the broader U.S. economy, ultimately impacting consumer confidence and\nspending.\nWhile strong consumer spending is a welcome underpinning to growth, I recognize that it is more\nof a “coincident” indicator; that is, it doesn’t provide great insight regarding future prospects for\nthe economy. Consumer confidence can be fragile—one or two months of weak jobs reports could\nput a dent in consumer confidence and spending habits, which could further slow GDP growth.\nThis is why I’ve repeatedly said that if we wait to see weakness in the consumer before taking\naction, we will have likely waited too long. From a risk-management point of view, that is a\nmistake I prefer not to make.\nA reality check for my thinking has been the level and shape of the U.S. Treasury curve. The 10year Treasury rate has declined from 3.24 percent on November 8, 2018, to 1.59 percent at the\ntime of this essay.29 During that same time period, the federal funds rate has declined from a range\nof 2 to 2.25 percent to 1.75 to 2 percent. It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) median estimate of the federal funds rate at the end of 2021 has gone from 3.25\nto 3.50 percent in the September 2018 summary30 to 2 to 2.25 percent in the recent September\n2019 submission.31\nIt is my view that the level and shape of the Treasury curve are reflective of slowing global growth,\nheightened trade tensions and a more pessimistic view regarding the prospects for U.S. economic\ngrowth. Pessimism regarding prospects for global growth is also one key reason why\napproximately 22 percent of global government debt is now trading at negative yields. 32\nI believe that moves in U.S. market-determined rates are consistent with concerns about economic\nweakness spreading more broadly to other parts of the U.S. economy. For me, these moves in\nmarket-determined rates are a reality check that suggests the setting of the federal funds rate was\ntighter than appropriate prior to the July and September FOMC meetings. In this regard, I intend\nto continue to carefully monitor the yield curve and gauge the ongoing implications of negative\ngaps between the federal funds rate and yields on longer-dated Treasury securities.\nAt this juncture, having adjusted the policy rate twice this year, it is my intention to take some\ntime to carefully monitor economic developments. I am mindful of the potential excesses and\nimbalances that can be created as a result of excessive accommodation. I am also alert to the\npossibility that recent escalations in trade tensions could moderate somewhat and this, in turn,\nmight alleviate some of the downside risks to the U.S. and global economies. In any event, I intend\nto avoid being rigid or predetermined from here, and plan to remain highly vigilant and keep an\nopen mind as to whether further action on the federal funds rate is appropriate.\n\n8\n\n\fAPPENDIX\nA Note on Technology-Enabled Disruption\nAs Dallas Fed economists have been discussing for the past several years, technology-enabled\ndisruption means workers are increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that\nexisting business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more\nefficiently selling or distributing goods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly using\ntechnology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the\nimpact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further\nintensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be\naccelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by the\neducational attainment levels of workers. For example, for those who have a college degree, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.9 percent. If\nyou have some college education, the unemployment rate is 2.9 percent and the participation rate\nis 65.1 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent and the participation\nrate is 57.8 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent and the\nparticipation rate is 46.0 percent.33\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and literacy skills or are retrained, these workers\nmay likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help\nexplain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as\nwell as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural reforms. The reforms could include\nactions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy, as well as improving math,\nreading and science achievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost\noverall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in\nsix years or less—now estimated at 60 percent in the U.S.34 Addressing the impacts of technologyenabled disruption will also require stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities\nacross the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill\nskilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational\nachievement levels in order to better equip our citizens to thrive in a world that increasingly\ndemands greater education, training and adaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions and investing in major capital\nprojects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital\ninvestment.\n\n9\n\n\fTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve\ngreater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins. This may help explain the\nrecord level of merger-and-acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nData are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Annual Update, published July 26, 2019.\nData are from the BEA, Federal Reserve Board and Haver Analytics.

Page 1 of 11\n\nA Brief Discussion Regarding the Impact of Climate Change on\nEconomic Conditions in the Eleventh District\nRobert S. Kaplan\nJune 27, 2019\nBased on the essay, “Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy,” published on June 24, 2019,\nfound at https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/kaplan/2019/rsk190624.aspx.\n\nOverview\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\nTexas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at a solid rate in 2019.\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy industry\nand international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the nation’s largest\nexporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by the migration of people\nand firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and new businesses to the state, which\nhave helped fuel the diversification of industry and the development of its largest metropolitan areas:\nHouston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin.[1]\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the Eleventh\nDistrict. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic cost to the district.\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that Harvey caused\napproximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state.[2] While the gross domestic product\n(GDP) and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along the Texas\ncoast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing rebuilding efforts, increased\ninsurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more stringent building codes. In addition, the\nstorm disproportionately impacted low-income families by wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to\nsafely domicile their families and increasing their need for health care and related services.[3] Given the\nextent of the damage, a key question for civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe\nweather events like Harvey are likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to\nbecome more frequent in the years ahead.\nThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major\ninfrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The seaports along\nthe Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the U.S.–Mexico border play a\ncritical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N.

Page 2 of 11\n\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events such as\nhurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people, cities, critical\nenergy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited great resilience in\nresponse to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report\non climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity and damage caused by extreme weather\nevents are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the appendix for a discussion of the National Climate\nAssessment findings and conclusions.)\n\nThe Impact of Climate Change: Frequency and Intensity of Severe Weather Events\nHurricane Activity\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since 2000,\napproximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S., comprising Texas,\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.[4] Over this period, 14 tropical storms passed through Texas,\nwith six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be categorized as hurricanes.\nThe National Climate Assessment asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This\ntrend is likely to be associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms.[5] In addition, the report\nindicates that climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the\nremainder of the 21st century.[6] As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of flooding on the\nwestern Gulf of Mexico coast will increase.[7]\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District and U.S.\nbecause of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy supplies as well as\naccess to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of these trends, the costs to repair\ndamage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially.[8]\nAs discussed earlier, one recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made\nlandfall on Aug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Harvey stalled over the Houston\nmetro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and experienced\nsubstantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks.[9] According to estimates\nby Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of approximately $65 billion and indirect costs\nof approximately $8.5 billion.[10] Tragically, 68 people are estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result\nof the storm. More than 300,000 homes and businesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded.[11]\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas Fed\nestimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully recovered.[12] While\nincreased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there are more lingering impacts\nincluding lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and costs of government programs to\nmitigate future damages.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity, chemical\nindustry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25 percent of the Gulf of\nMexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of Harvey.[13] Refinery utilization\nalong the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to approximately 60 percent.[14] More than 50 percent\nof U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was temporarily disrupted.[15] The refinery outages resulting from\nHarvey-related shutdowns led to a temporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents.[16]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N.

Page 4 of 11\n\nImpact on Water Supplies, Flooding and Agriculture\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as well as\nincrease the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation.[17] For the agriculture sector, this increased\nweather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability and risk. These trends\nmay also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk in U.S.\nagriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested acreage, reduce\nlivestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed or irrigation water.”[18] For\nthe livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural production in Texas[19]\n—drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the resulting pasture damage and herd reduction\nthat take years to recover from.\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm output\nmakes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP,[20] agricultural losses from the historic 2011 drought were\nestimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the average value of agricultural\nproduction and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought on record.[21] Droughts also induce\nadditional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in drought years—fertilizer, crop storage,\nmachinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local economy resulting from lost income for producers,\nharvest laborers, truck drivers and agribusinesses.\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as climate\nchange progresses,[22] also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and in other parts of\nthe country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet for farmers to prepare the soil\nand plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop substitution. Flooding late in the season\ncauses harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both hamper farm income. Hotter temperatures\nprompted by climate change also pose additional pest problems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and\ncosts, and hamper livestock productivity—increasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing\ncalving rates and milk production.[23]\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could make it\nmore difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop yields become more\nvariable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop production loans and tighten their\nlending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as insurers have more indemnities to pay out\nfrom droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural sector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include\nplanting more drought-resistant crops, increasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention\nand irrigation application. In Texas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more\nheat than grain crops and has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of\nflooding.\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have additional\nimpacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an adverse effect on people’s\nhealth and quality of life.[24] They will likely lead to increased water evaporation and soil moisture\ndeterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns.[25] Increased ocean acidity and warming will affect aquatic life,\nimpacting the commercial and recreational fishing industries along the Gulf Coast.[26]\n\nImplications for the Dallas Fed\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject. However, I\ndo intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are likely impacting economic\nconditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0627b.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fA Brief Discussion Regarding the Impact of Climate Change on Economic Conditions in t... Page 5 of 11\n\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain cities and\nindustries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these severe weather events\nhave historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the longer-term risks that are leading\nseveral cities and companies to make substantial capital investments in improving infrastructure in order to\nmitigate the damage of future severe weather.\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to materially\nnegatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall outlook for the region.\nHowever, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the likely frequency and/or severity of\nextreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme weather events may begin to have a negative\nimpact on the region’s longer-term business prospects and migration trends.\n\nAdaptation and Mitigation Efforts\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks. State and\nlocal leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the viability of\nneighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from severe weather events,\nprotect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and transmission of energy services in\nthe event of a severe weather-related disruption.\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business contacts, we\nare learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy projects and sustainability\ninitiatives. Energy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts of\nshale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively investing in battery\nstorage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in the U.S. In addition, Texas is\nnow the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation.[27] Many companies are adopting greenhousegas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their carbon footprint.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the Eleventh\nDistrict to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the region’s ability to manage\nthe effects of future severe weather events.[28] In addition, in order to improve our sustainability leadership\nand enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed has established a sustainability initiative intended\nto reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and empower our employees to take actions which will improve\nthe sustainability performance of our Bank.[29]\n\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this essay (including the appendix) has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate\nAssessment and discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District.\nDallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate change on\neconomic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N.

Page 6 of 11\n\nAPPENDIX\nNational Climate Assessment Findings and Conclusions\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). It was\nmore formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research Act. The USGCRP was\ngiven the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research\nprogram which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to humaninduced and natural processes of global change.”[30]\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its\nimpact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy,\nHealth and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection\nAgency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian\nInstitution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA).\nThe NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production\nand use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and it describes current trends in global\nchange and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more than 300\nexperts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the report was performed by\nthe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.[31]\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to\nstrengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related\nthreats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.”[32] The report cites “significant,\nclear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly,\nthan anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.”[33]\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface,\npreventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these gases rise, the average\ntemperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat emitted by Earth is retained inside\nthe climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.[34] Greenhouse\ngases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane.\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8 degrees\nFahrenheit between 1901 and 2016,[35] and that for the period since 1986, global annual average\ntemperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year time period in at\nleast the last 1,700 years.[36]\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue to increase\nin the coming decades.”[37] The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures are expected to\nbecome common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that in the U.S., increases of\n2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change scenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more\ndire scenario, relative to 1986–2015.[38]\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in ocean\ntemperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in snow cover and sea\nice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events.[39],[40]\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0627b.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fA Brief Discussion Regarding the Impact of Climate Change on Economic Conditions in t... Page 7 of 11\n\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains that, due\nto the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall\nevents are expected to increase over the coming century. The report asserts that warmer temperatures lead\nto increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nwhich is likely to lead to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes.[41]\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1970.\n[42] It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result of rises in sea\nsurface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions.[43] While the frequency of tropical storms is\nnot expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with sustained wind speeds in excess of\n130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is expected to increase.[44]\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This\ninfrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas trade.[45]\nThe report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support broad sectors of the\nU.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather extremes.[46]\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to increased\nevaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts in certain regions of\nthe U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains that when droughts occur\nsimultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions for substantial wildfires, which have\nincreased in frequency across the western U.S. since the 1980s.[47] Droughts can also have a significant\nimpact on agriculture.\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment.\n\nNotes\n1.

Kaplan\nAt the recent June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds\nrate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In our statement, the FOMC indicated that\nuncertainties about the outlook have increased and stated that “in light of these uncertainties and\nmuted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a\nstrong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.” 1\nThe purpose of this essay is to describe my assessment of economic conditions in the U.S. and\nglobal economies. In addition, I will discuss business activity in the Eleventh Federal Reserve\nDistrict and describe how the implications of climate change are impacting Dallas Fed economic\nanalysis of the district and the nation. Lastly, I will discuss my views regarding the appropriate\nstance of U.S. monetary policy.\nThe U.S. Economy\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a rate of\napproximately 2 percent in 2019. This is slower than the 3 percent growth achieved in 2018,\nprimarily due to continued waning of U.S. fiscal stimulus, a lower rate of global growth and\nincreased business uncertainty due mostly to heightened trade tensions.\nThe U.S. economy has been bolstered by a strong consumer. Household balance sheets are in\nrelatively healthy shape—household debt declined from 97 percent of GDP at year-end 2008 to\napproximately 75 percent in the first quarter of 2019. 2 In addition, a tight labor market has given\nan added boost to consumer spending and confidence. The consumer is approximately 70 percent\nof the U.S. economy, so this strength provides a solid underpinning to the outlook for growth.\nOn the cautionary side, trade tensions and uncertainty have increased significantly over the past\ntwo months. Tariffs and trade uncertainty appear to be having a negative impact on companies’\nability to manage input costs and some chilling influence on their capital spending plans. Even\nbefore this recent escalation, nonresidential fixed investment had contributed only 0.3 percentage\npoints to GDP growth in the first quarter versus an average of 0.9 for 2017 and 2018. 3 In a recent\nDallas Fed Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, more than half of companies responding\nreported that tariffs are increasing their input costs, and a material number of companies reported\na reduction in their capital spending plans. 4\nThere is evidence that tariffs and trade uncertainties may be impacting manufacturing activity. The\nmost recent manufacturing sector surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,\nPhiladelphia and Dallas all show significant deterioration in manufacturing business sentiment.\n\n1\n\n\fOne positive development worth noting is that balance sheets of U.S. banks appear to be in much\nbetter shape than 10 years ago. While I have flagged the high level of corporate debt as a potential\namplifier in the next downturn, I would also note that the improvement in bank balance sheets\nmeans that they should be capable of extending credit in a way that is supportive of further\neconomic expansion. The Fed’s recent stress tests indicate that, after adjusting for stress-scenario\nlosses, capital levels at the largest U.S. banks would still be above capital levels those banks held\nbefore the financial crisis of 2008–09. 5\nThe Labor Market\nThe U.S. unemployment rate is 3.6 percent. 6 At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on U-6, a\nbroader measure of unemployment that tracks unemployed plus discouraged workers who have\ngiven up looking for work, plus part-time workers who would prefer to work full time. This\nmeasure is now 7.1 percent, which is well below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent in December\n2006.\nThe labor force participation rate now stands at 62.8 percent. It has ranged between 62.4 percent\nand 63.2 percent for the past five years. The participation rate is the percentage of people 16 years\nof age and older who participate in the workforce by either working or looking for work.\nOne factor supporting the overall participation rate is the improvement in the participation rate of\nprime-age workers (25 to 54). Prime-age participation has increased from 80.9 percent in 2015 to\n82.1 percent today. Chart 1 highlights these trends in labor force participation.\nIt is important to recognize that the aging of the U.S. workforce is negatively impacting the overall\nparticipation rate because as workers age, an increasing percentage are more likely to retire. It is\nthe view of Dallas Fed economists that increasing participation of prime-age workers is unlikely\nto last indefinitely—aging population demographics will tend to bring down the overall labor force\nparticipation rate. In light of these trends, it is our view that the labor force participation rate will\nlikely decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years, even as workers tend to remain in the\nlabor force later in their careers. 7\nThe May jobs growth number was approximately 75,000—lower than the average monthly job\ngrowth of approximately 223,000 in 2018 and 186,000 in 2019 through April. 8 It is the view of\nDallas Fed economists that moderation in the rate of job growth is consistent with a labor market\nthat is tight and likely at or past the level of full employment in the U.S. As a consequence of this\ntightness, we would expect job growth to remain moderate in the months ahead. Long-run GDP\ngrowth is made up of growth in the workforce and growth in labor productivity. Assuming there\nis not an offsetting burst in productivity growth, a slowing rate of workforce growth will likely\ntranslate into slowing GDP growth in the U.S.\n\n2\n\n\fChart 1\nLabor Force Participation Rates\nPercent\n\nPercent\n84\n\n68\n\n67\n\nTotal, 16+ years (left axis)\n\nMay '19\n82.1\n\nPrime age, 25-54 years (right axis)\n\n83\n\n66\n\n82\n\n65\n\n81\n\n64\n\n80\n\n63\n\n62\n\n62.8\n\n'07\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\n'14\n\n'15\n\n'16\n\n'17\n\n'18\n\n'19\n\n79\n\n78\n\nNOTES: Labor force participation rates are seasonally adjusted. Gray bar indicates recession.\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWage Growth and Continuing Strong Jobs Gains\nIf we are at or past full employment, why is the average nominal rate of wage growth only 3.1\npercent? 9 Also, even with the moderation in May jobs growth, why has job growth in 2019\naveraged approximately 164,000 workers per month, well over what is necessary to keep up with\npopulation growth? 10\nRegarding wages, our Dallas Fed economists believe that more muted inflation and inflation\nexpectations, as compared with previous expansions, are factors tempering nominal wage growth\nin this expansion. Also, they argue that older workers have increased as a share of the labor force\nover the past 10 years—and their rate of wage growth tends to be more tepid than that of younger\nworkers. 11 Lastly, our economists believe that more subdued productivity growth has likely had a\nsomewhat muting impact on wage growth.\nOn a related point, research by the Dallas Fed’s Joe Tracy and Michael Morris along with Robert\nRich of the Cleveland Fed indicates that individual wage growth is, in fact, higher than standard\nstatistics have suggested. Their research finds that the growth rate of widely followed wage\nindicators like average hourly earnings are disproportionately weighted to high-wage earners, who\nare also typically older and have a lower rate of wage growth. They find that an average of\nindividual wage growth rates, which equally weights the wage growth of all workers, has been\nclose to 5 percent in recent years—materially higher than the 3.1 percent average hourly earnings\nmeasure recorded in May 2019. 12\n3\n\n\fRegarding recent job gains, one key driver has been the improvement in prime-age labor force\nparticipation (described earlier). As part of this improvement, it is important to note recent gains\nreflect disproportionate improvements in participation by previously underrepresented groups. For\nexample, Hispanic women across educational attainment levels, as well as black men with a high\nschool diploma or less, have disproportionately improved their levels of labor force participation.\nChart 2 provides a breakdown of recent changes in participation rates, based on educational\nattainment, race/ethnicity and gender.\nChart 2\nChange in Prime-Age Labor Force Participation Rate, May 2018 to May 2019\nWomen\nPercentage points\n2.50\n\nHigh school or less\nSome college\nBachelor's or higher\n\n1.50\n0.50\n-0.50\n-1.50\n-2.50\n\nMen\n\nNon-Hispanic white\n(31% of prime-age pop.)\n\nHispanic\n(7% of prime-age pop.)\n\nBlack\n(7% of prime-age pop.)\n\nPercentage points\n2.50\n\nOther\n(5% of prime-age pop.)\n\nHigh school or less\nSome college\n\n1.50\n\nBachelor's or higher\n\n0.50\n-0.50\n-1.50\n-2.50\n-3.50\n\nNon-Hispanic white\n(31% of prime-age pop.)\n\nHispanic\n(8% of prime-age pop.)\n\nBlack\n(6% of prime-age pop.)\n\nNOTES: Data are 12-month moving averages.

To the extent historically underrepresented\ngroups can be drawn into the workforce and gain the skills and experience that enhance their\nlikelihood of staying in the labor force, this should have the impact of increasing the size and\nproductive capacity of the U.S. labor force.\nIncreasing the size and productive capacity of the labor force is especially important as firms face\nsignificant difficulties trying to find workers. A recent Dallas Fed Texas Business Outlook Survey\n4\n\n\ffinds that 71 percent of firms surveyed are seeking to hire and 83 percent of those firms report that\nthey are having difficulty finding qualified workers. 13\nAs discussed earlier, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that while there is some scope for\nfurther gains in labor force participation, it will not be sufficient to offset the effects of a\nhistorically tight labor market. As a result, it is likely that the rate of job growth will remain\nmoderate in the months ahead. In this regard, we believe that job growth in the range of 60,000 to\n120,000 jobs per month will be consistent with a “strong” 14 jobs market for the remainder of 2019.\nInflation\nThe most recent personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reading of inflation was approximately\n1.5 percent on a 12-month basis. 15 Our Dallas Fed economists prefer to look at the Dallas Fed\nTrimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which has been running consistently between 1.9 and 2\npercent over the past year—and is currently running at approximately 2 percent. 16 This reading of\ncore inflation exes out extreme moves to the upside and downside in individual inflation\ncomponents. Research by my Dallas Fed colleagues Evan Koenig and Jim Dolmas suggests that\nthe trimmed mean measure is a highly useful indicator of future headline PCE inflation trends. 17\nIt is our expectation that the trimmed mean will end this year in the range of 2 percent and that\nheadline PCE inflation will move higher over the next 12 months.\nI have written and spoken about the idea that there are two key elements of inflation: the cyclical\nand the structural. Dallas Fed economists believe these two forces are currently working in\nopposing fashion.\nCyclical inflationary forces are building. These cyclical forces are driven primarily by a tightening\nlabor market and continuing wage gains. Historically, economists would have expected a\ntightening labor market to contribute to greater price pressures. This connection between labor\nmarket slack, wages and prices is sometimes referred to as the “Phillips curve.” 18 Given these\ncyclical factors, why hasn’t inflation been more apparent? Why have we spent most of the past\nseven years—and particularly the past two years, when the unemployment rate has been below\nmost estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—with a headline PCE inflation rate below the\nFed’s 2 percent objective?\nOur view at the Dallas Fed is that the structural forces of technology, technology-enabled\ndisruption and, to some lesser extent, globalization are muting the relationship between labor\nmarket tightening and wage gains, and are even further muting the connection between wage gains\nand prices. Technology advancements such as artificial intelligence are allowing businesses to\nreplace people with technology. In addition, new business models, often technology enabled and\naided by the proliferation of mobile computing power, are disrupting old business models and\nallowing consumers to have more power in choosing the lowest price at a high level of\nconvenience. Think Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and so on. These models are often further enabled\nby the fact that the cost of capital is historically low, and financial markets are willing to assign\nthese businesses substantial valuations and advance substantial amounts of capital, even though\nthese companies frequently generate little or no profitability in their early years.\n\n5\n\n\fAgainst this background, numerous Dallas Fed business contacts report having materially less\npricing power today than they have had historically. Based on these discussions, it is our view that\nas cyclical forces build, which lead to increased costs, these cost increases are just as likely to lead\nto business margin erosion as they are higher prices.\nIn a historically tight labor market, cyclical inflationary pressures will likely remain elevated. The\nquestion is whether they are strong enough to offset the structural forces that are muting inflation.\nTime will tell, but we are watching this dynamic very carefully at the Dallas Fed. While the Phillips\ncurve appears to have flattened, it might be a mistake to assume that it is dead—it may just be that\nthe level of unemployment that creates undue price pressures is lower than we have historically\nexperienced—but the overall dynamic hasn’t gone away completely.\nThe Global Economy\nGlobal (ex the U.S.) GDP growth was approximately 4.3 percent in 2017, declined to 4.0 percent\nin 2018 and is expected to be 3.6 percent in 2019. 19 Furthermore, risks to this outlook appear to be\ntilted to the downside. Growth expectations are sluggish due to slowing growth in the euro area\nand in other advanced economies, as well as somewhat more muted growth in emerging\neconomies.\nTrade tensions likely play some role in this softening. While exports are approximately 12 percent\nof U.S. GDP, they are 20 percent for China, 47 percent for Germany and 18 percent for Japan. 20\n(See Chart 3.)\nChart 3\nExports as Percent of Gross Domestic Product\nU.S.\nJapan\nChina\nU.K.\nCanada\nMexico\nGermany\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\nPercent of GDP\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nNOTES: Exports include goods and services.

This is particularly true in North America.\nFor example, it is estimated that 73 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico are composed of\nintermediate goods; that is, goods that are part of integrated supply-chain and logistics\nrelationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to increase their global competitiveness and\nkeep jobs in this country. 22\nEconomic Conditions in the Eleventh District: Including a Brief Discussion Regarding the\nImpact of Climate Change\nOverview\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New\nMexico. Texas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at\na solid rate in 2019.\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy\nindustry and international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the\nnation’s largest exporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by\nthe migration of people and firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and\nnew businesses to the state, which have helped fuel the diversification of industry and the\ndevelopment of its largest metropolitan areas: Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and\nAustin. 23\nThe Impact of Climate Change: Frequency and Intensity of Severe Weather Events\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the\nEleventh District. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic\ncost to the district.\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that\nHarvey caused approximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state. 24 While\nthe GDP and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along\nthe Texas coast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing\nrebuilding efforts, increased insurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more\nstringent building codes. In addition, the storm disproportionately impacted low-income families\nby wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to safely domicile their families and increasing\ntheir need for health care and related services. 25 Given the extent of the damage, a key question\nfor civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe weather events like Harvey\nare likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to become more\nfrequent in the years ahead.\n\n7\n\n\fThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major\ninfrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The\nseaports along the Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the\nU.S.–Mexico border play a critical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events\nsuch as hurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people,\ncities, critical energy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited\ngreat resilience in response to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate\nAssessment, a comprehensive report on climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity\nand damage caused by extreme weather events are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the\nappendix for a discussion of the National Climate Assessment findings and conclusions, as well\nas a discussion of certain major considerations for the Eleventh District.)\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject.\nHowever, I do intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are\nlikely impacting economic conditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain\ncities and industries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these\nsevere weather events have historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the\nlonger-term risks that are leading several cities and companies to make substantial capital\ninvestments in improving infrastructure in order to mitigate the damage of future severe weather.\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to\nmaterially negatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall\noutlook for the region. However, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the\nlikely frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme\nweather events may begin to have a negative impact on the region’s longer-term business prospects\nand migration trends.\nAdaptation and Mitigation Efforts\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks.\nState and local leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the\nviability of neighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from\nsevere weather events, protect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and\ntransmission of energy services in the event of a severe weather-related disruption.\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business\ncontacts, we are learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy\nprojects and sustainability initiatives.\nEnergy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts\nof shale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively\ninvesting in battery storage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in\n8\n\n\fthe U.S. In addition, Texas is now the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation. 26 Many\ncompanies are adopting greenhouse-gas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their\ncarbon footprint.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the\nEleventh District to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the\nregion’s ability to manage the effects of future severe weather events. 27 In addition, in order to\nimprove our sustainability leadership and enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed\nhas established a sustainability initiative intended to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and\nempower our employees to take actions which will improve the sustainability performance of our\nBank. 28\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nIn light of relatively solid rates of economic growth, a labor market at or past full employment and\na PCE inflation rate somewhat below target, I believe it is appropriate to take a balanced approach\nto monetary policy. I would note that, while headline PCE inflation is running below target, the\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of PCE inflation has been running at approximately 2 percent\nand our economists expect this measure of inflation to end the year in the neighborhood of 2\npercent. In assessing economic conditions, I am cognizant of the structural challenges of slowing\nworkforce growth due to an aging population and limitations on business pricing power due to\ntechnology and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization.\nI am also highly attuned to the fact that, since early May, downside risks to the outlook have\nincreased due to heightened trade tensions and decelerating rates of global growth. The economy\nis also being impacted by the waning of fiscal stimulus. The question is whether trade and global\ngrowth uncertainties are likely to persist in a manner that leads to a material deterioration in the\noutlook for U.S. economic growth.\nAt this stage, I believe it is too early to make a judgment on this question. These heightened\nuncertainties have intensified over the past seven weeks, and it is certainly possible that events\ncould occur in the near future which would substantially reduce these uncertainties. In this\nsituation, I believe it would be wise to allow events to unfold a bit more before making judgments\nregarding the stance of monetary policy. I think this approach would be particularly wise in light\nof the fact that, as mentioned earlier, my base case is for solid GDP growth in 2019, and I expect\nlabor market conditions to remain at levels I would consider at or past full employment. In addition,\nfinancial conditions—the cost and availability of credit—are particularly robust by historical\nstandards.\nAs I have said previously, monetary accommodation is not “free.” I am concerned that adding\nmonetary stimulus, at this juncture, would contribute to a build-up of excesses and imbalances in\nthe economy which may ultimately prove to be difficult and painful to manage.\nI have spoken about the level of corporate debt as potentially one of those excesses that is likely\nto be a “burden” on the economy in the event of a downturn. Persistently low interest rates make\nborrowing for share repurchase and merger transactions highly accretive to a company’s earnings\n9\n\n\fper share. In a world where businesses have less and less pricing power and managing costs is\nessential, debt-financed activity becomes harder to resist. Debt-financed share repurchase and\nmerger activity may help fuel growth in earnings per share when times are good, but in a downturn,\nincreased debt levels will mean that a higher percentage of cash flow will be necessary to service\ninterest and principal repayments. This is just one example of the type of excess that may seem\ninnocuous when times are good but can become more troublesome in a downturn.\nIn this regard, I think it is important to emphasize that we are well-served by rigorous\nmacroprudential policies, particularly tough capital requirements and stress testing for large banks\nas well as oversight of nonbank financials. In a period of persistently low interest rates, the\npotential exists for excesses and imbalances to build, and rigorous macroprudential oversight\nshould provide more flexibility for monetary policy to deal primarily with economic conditions.\nI am closely monitoring the shape of the yield curve in the U.S. The three-month Treasury yield is\ntoday at 2.12 percent. In my view, the one-year Treasury at 1.93 percent, the five-year at 1.77\npercent and the 10-year at 2.03 percent are indicative of sluggish expectations for future growth—\nand recent heightening of trade tensions has likely exacerbated these growth concerns. 29 It is\nimportant to emphasize that financial markets can change very rapidly and are highly sensitive not\nonly to increased economic uncertainties, but also to expectations of Federal Reserve monetary\npolicy actions.\nAs I have said before, I would be concerned about an inversion of the curve—either three-month\nto 10-year or one-year to 10-year—of some size and duration. My concern emanates from my\nbelief that an inverted curve ultimately makes it more difficult for financial intermediaries to\nborrow short and lend long—and, if the inversion persists, it would likely begin to impede the\ncreation of credit and lead to a tightening of financial conditions. I will continue to watch this\ncarefully.\nI believe that we currently are in the neighborhood of a neutral setting for monetary policy—that\nis, we are likely neither accommodative nor restrictive. Over the coming weeks and months, I will\nbe closely monitoring developments in the U.S. and global economies as well as the status of\nfinancial conditions (especially credit spreads and availability of credit). In particular, I intend to\nbe highly vigilant with regard to the persistence of heightened trade tensions and indications that\nslowing global growth is spilling over into a material deterioration of the economic outlook for the\nU.S. In the meantime, I believe it would be wise to take additional time and allow events to unfold\nas we consider whether it is appropriate to make changes to the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\n10\n\n\fAPPENDIX\nNational Climate Assessment Findings and Conclusions\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program\n(USGCRP). It was more formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research\nAct. The USGCRP was given the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and\nintegrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand,\nassess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” 30\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change\nand its impact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce,\nDefense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National\nScience Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate\nAssessment (NCA). The NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment,\nagriculture, energy production and use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and\nit describes current trends in global change and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more\nthan 300 experts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the\nreport was performed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. 31\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and\ncontinues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and\nthat climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.” 32\nThe report cites “significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is\nmuch higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with\nwidespread and growing impacts.” 33\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s\nsurface, preventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these\ngases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat\nemitted by Earth is retained inside the climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known\nas the greenhouse effect. 34 Greenhouse gases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor\nand methane.\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8\ndegrees Fahrenheit between 1901 and 2016, 35 and that for the period since 1986, global annual\naverage temperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year\ntime period in at least the last 1,700 years. 36\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue\nto increase in the coming decades.” 37 The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures\n11\n\n\fare expected to become common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that\nin the U.S., increases of 2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change\nscenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more dire scenario, relative to 1986–2015. 38\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in\nocean temperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in\nsnow cover and sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy\nprecipitation events. 39,40\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains\nthat, due to the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and\nintensity of heavy rainfall events are expected to increase over the coming century. The report\nasserts that warmer temperatures lead to increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause\nhigher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is likely to lead to more frequent and intense\nprecipitation extremes. 41\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity\nsince 1970. 42 It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result\nof rises in sea surface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions. 43 While the frequency\nof tropical storms is not expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with\nsustained wind speeds in excess of 130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is\nexpected to increase. 44\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This\ninfrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas\ntrade. 45 The report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support\nbroad sectors of the U.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather\nextremes. 46\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to\nincreased evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts\nin certain regions of the U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains\nthat when droughts occur simultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions\nfor substantial wildfires, which have increased in frequency across the western U.S. since the\n1980s. 47 Droughts can also have a significant impact on agriculture.\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment.\nDiscussion of Certain Major Considerations for the Eleventh District\nHurricane Activity\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since\n2000, approximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S.,\ncomprising Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. 48 Over this period, 14 tropical\n\n12\n\n\fstorms passed through Texas, with six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be\ncategorized as hurricanes.\nThe NCA asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This trend is likely to\nbe associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms. 49 In addition, the report indicates\nthat climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the\nremainder of the 21st century. 50 As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of\nflooding on the western Gulf of Mexico coast will increase. 51\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District\nand U.S. because of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy\nsupplies as well as access to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of\nthese trends, the costs to repair damage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially. 52\nOne recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on\nAug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Hurricane Harvey stalled over\nthe Houston metro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and\nexperienced substantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks. 53\nAccording to estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of\napproximately $65 billion and indirect costs of approximately $8.5 billion. 54 Tragically, 68 people\nare estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. More than 300,000 homes and\nbusinesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded. 55\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas\nFed estimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully\nrecovered. 56 While increased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there\nare more lingering impacts including lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and\ncosts of government programs to mitigate future damages.\nAs discussed earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity,\nchemical industry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25\npercent of the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of\nHarvey. 57 Refinery utilization along the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to\napproximately 60 percent. 58 More than 50 percent of U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was\ntemporarily disrupted. 59 The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns led to a\ntemporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents. 60\nIn the aftermath of this storm, Gulf Coast cities as well as the state of Texas and various federal\nagencies have been working together to undertake multibillion-dollar investments to upgrade\nreservoir and flood mitigation infrastructure to better protect the region (residents and businesses)\nin the event of future weather events.\n\n13\n\n\fImpact on Water Supplies, Flooding and Agriculture\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as\nwell as increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. 61 For the agriculture sector,\nthis increased weather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability\nand risk. These trends may also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk\nin U.S. agriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested\nacreage, reduce livestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed\nor irrigation water.” 62 For the livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of\nagricultural production in Texas 63—drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the\nresulting pasture damage and herd reduction that take years to recover from.\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm\noutput makes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP, 64 agricultural losses from the historic\n2011 drought were estimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the\naverage value of agricultural production and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought\non record. 65 Droughts also induce additional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in\ndrought years—fertilizer, crop storage, machinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local\neconomy resulting from lost income for producers, harvest laborers, truck drivers and\nagribusinesses.\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as\nclimate change progresses, 66 also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and\nin other parts of the country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet\nfor farmers to prepare the soil and plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop\nsubstitution. Flooding late in the season causes harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both\nhamper farm income. Hotter temperatures prompted by climate change also pose additional pest\nproblems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and costs, and hamper livestock productivity—\nincreasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing calving rates and milk\nproduction. 67\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could\nmake it more difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop\nyields become more variable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop\nproduction loans and tighten their lending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as\ninsurers have more indemnities to pay out from droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural\nsector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include planting more drought-resistant crops,\nincreasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention and irrigation application. In\nTexas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more heat than grain crops\nand has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of flooding.\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have\nadditional impacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an\nadverse effect on people’s health and quality of life. 68 They will likely lead to increased water\n14\n\n\fevaporation and soil moisture deterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns. 69 Increased ocean\nacidity and warming will affect aquatic life, impacting the commercial and recreational fishing\nindustries along the Gulf Coast. 70\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this appendix has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate Assessment\nand discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District.\nDallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate\nchange on economic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\n\n15\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nFederal Open Market Committee statement, Federal Reserve Board of Governors press release, June 19,\n2019.\n2\nData are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Federal Reserve Board and Haver Analytics.\nHousehold debt is from the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds series and is defined as households\nand nonprofit organizations; debt securities and loans; liability.\n3\nData are from the BEA.\n4\nTexas Business Outlook Surveys, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, June 24, 2019.\n5\nSee “Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,” speech by Jerome H.

            "content": "Remarks for Hoover Institution monetary policy conference\nRobert S. Kaplan\nMay 07, 2019\nIn our May 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In the postmeeting statement, we commented that, on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are\nrunning below 2 percent. The statement also noted that we “continue to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and\ninflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”\n\nBackground\nHeadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, has been running below our 2 percent target\nfor a substantial portion of the time period since 2012.[1] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE\ninflation, which filters out extreme upside and downside moves in inflation components. We believe this measure is a useful indicator of underlying inflation\ntrends. The trimmed mean is currently running at approximately 2.0 percent on a trailing 12-month basis and has been in a range of 1.4 to 2.0 percent over\nthe past seven years.[2]\nThe unemployment rate is currently 3.6 percent and has been below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of full employment for two years.[3] At the\nDallas Fed, we particularly focus on the U-6 measure of unemployment, which measures the level of unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who\nindicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure now\nstands at 7.3 percent, and is below its 2006 prerecession low of approximately 7.9 percent.[4]\nDallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.25 percent in 2019. While this is slower growth than in 2018, it should be sufficient to further\ntighten the labor market and cause the rate of wage growth to modestly pick up over the course of 2019. Our economists also expect that, despite some\nrecent weakness in headline and core inflation readings, the headline PCE and Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation are likely to firm,\nending the year in the range of 2 percent.\nSome observers have suggested that, with this tight of a labor market, there should be greater wage pressure than the 3.2 percent recent reading of average\nhourly earnings growth over the past year.[5] They argue that they would have expected wage pressure to have translated into greater price pressure. As\nmost of you know, the Fed has initiated a review of its framework and communication strategy to explore whether there are actions we could take to improve\nour ability to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWith all this as background, and in light of our ongoing framework review, I thought it would make sense to step back and explore some of the potential\nissues raised by recent weakness in headline and core inflation measures. In particular, I will focus my remarks on labor slack, inflation expectations, and\nstructural forces with regard to how they may be impacting the Fed’s ability to meets its 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nLabor slack\nA number of economists have argued that there may be more slack in the U.S. labor market than standard measurements are capturing. They believe that\nthere may be more scope to attract and retain previously under-represented groups in the workforce. To support this argument, it is worth noting that, since\n2015, increases in labor force participation have disproportionately come from under-represented groups. For example, the participation rate of the primeage female population with less than a high school education has increased significantly, as has the participation rate for black males and Hispanic females.\n[6]\nIt is also worth noting that the prime-age labor force participation rate in 2018 was 82.0 percent versus 83.1 percent in 2008 and 84.1 percent in 1998.[7] If\nwe compare U.S. prime-age labor force participation to other developed countries, we find that the U.S. participation rate lags behind many of these\ncountries, although this gap has begun to close somewhat since early 2015.\n\n\fIs it possible that the strength of the labor market is drawing in workers who have been on the sidelines—particularly under-represented groups—and is also\nencouraging workers to stay in the labor force?[8] Is it possible that improvements in skills training, child care availability and transportation availability have\ndrawn, and could still draw, more sidelined workers back into the workforce—and keep them in the workforce?\nIt’s important to recognize that gains in labor force participation act to slow the decline of the unemployment rate. Additionally, recent research—including\nwork done by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Marc Giannoni and Ayşegül Şahin—has argued that changes in demographics, especially the aging of the\nworkforce, the aging of firms, as well as the increase in the attachment of women to the labor force, may have contributed to a decline in the natural rate of\nunemployment.[9]\nIf this is the case, we may look back five years from now and conclude that the natural rate of unemployment was simply lower than we had been historically\naccustomed, and that one of the reasons for the perceived surprising lack of inflation pressure was due to an excessively high estimate of the equilibrium\nlevel of unemployment. In this explanation, the Phillips curve may be alive and well, but the intercept is simply lower than we have previously understood. If\nthis is true, central bankers need to be vigilant to the possibility that there is still the potential for inflation readings to firm substantially, with a time lag, if the\ndegree of full employment overshoot becomes more sizeable and persists for an extended period of time.\n\nInflation expectations\nAnother debate relates to the Fed’s ability to manage longer-run inflation expectations. As you all know, the Fed has clearly articulated a 2 percent PCE\ninflation target. Many would argue that the Fed has done a reasonably good job in helping to anchor inflation expectations. They would cite the fact that\nsurveys of professional forecasters’ inflation expectations are close to 2 percent, and they would suggest that this is not a coincidence; it is a reflection of the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s policy actions and communications, which have been aimed at achieving and maintaining full employment while\nanchoring longer-run inflation expectations at our 2 percent objective.\nHowever, other economists contend that, due to an extended period of inflation running below our 2 percent target, expectations may have drifted somewhat\nlower. This downward drift might be reflected in the University of Michigan survey for inflation expectations over the next five years, which has gone from an\naverage of 2.9 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in the 12 months ending April 2019.[10] These economists argue that the Fed may need to do more to help\nkeep inflation expectations well-anchored. In particular, has the Fed done enough to convince the public that it is committed to a symmetrical 2 percent\ninflation target? Are there changes to the Fed’s policy framework, communication strategy or other actions the Fed could take to help better anchor inflation\nexpectations at the Fed’s 2 percent target?\n\nStructural forces\nAn additional area of exploration deals with structural changes in the U.S. and global economies. In particular, are the forces of technology, technologyenabled disruption and, to some extent, globalization, limiting the pricing power of businesses and muting inflation?\nDallas Fed economists recognize that we are living through a period of acceleration in the trend of technology replacing people. We are also seeing the\nproliferation of new models for selling goods and services—often technology-enabled (think Amazon, Airbnb, Uber or Lyft)—that replace traditional models for\ndelivering these goods and services. These new models are often enabling consumers to buy products and services at prices that are dramatically below\nthose of incumbent competitors. To take advantage of this trend, large-platform companies are increasingly bundling products and services—sometimes with\nlittle or no gross margin—in order to gain market share.\n\n\fAll this is being facilitated by the fact that the consumer now has in the palm of his or her hand more computing power than most companies did just 15 years\nago. Consumers are able to use this new technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices, often with greater convenience.\nThe impact of these trends means that companies, depending on the industry, often have much less pricing power than they did historically. In response,\ncompanies are investing even more in technology that replaces people and, increasingly, taking actions to achieve greater scale in order to effectively\nmanage the investment and margin implications of these trends. The net result is that, in a range of industries, if there is wage pressure, companies are just\nas likely to see margin erosion versus being able to pass these costs on to the customer.\nAs a result of these trends, we are seeing a record level of merger activity by companies in order to get more scale to compete in this environment.[11]\nCompanies are using increased debt issuance to fund merger activities to achieve greater scale and are also using increased debt issuance to fund accretive\nshare repurchases in order to soften the margin dilution they are experiencing.[12] Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to take steps to\nmerge and fund accretive share repurchases or face replacement of their boards of directors and/or their executive teams.\nThe workforce is also experiencing the impact of this trend. Highly educated and skilled workers are often seeing the benefits of technology and disruption—\ndepending on their company or industry. However, those workers with a high school education or less—who lack specific skills training—are increasingly\nseeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. This is leading to increasing wealth and income inequality.\nThis discussion would suggest that powerful structural changes in the economy may be an important aspect of more muted price pressures. Further, there\nmay be some evidence in recent productivity statistics that new technology and greater economies of scale could be helping to dampen growth in unit labor\ncosts.\n\nImplications\nThe Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is symmetrical—that is, we don’t want inflation to run persistently below or above our 2 percent target. Sustained\ndeviations from our inflation target could increase the likelihood that inflation expectations begin to drift or become unanchored. This could, in turn, make it\nmore difficult for the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability.\nIn this context, the various issues raised in this essay merit further discussion and attention. As the Federal Reserve conducts its ongoing review of our\nmonetary policy framework and communication strategy, the challenge will be to explore potential options for enhancing our policy approach so that we can\nbetter achieve our dual-mandate objectives.\n\nNotes\n1.

            "content": "Remarks for Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\nRemarks for Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference\nRobert S. Kaplan\nMay 07, 2019\nIn our May 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a\nrange of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In the post-meeting statement, we commented that, on a 12-month basis, overall\ninflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. The\nstatement also noted that we “continue to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market\nconditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”\n\nBackground\nHeadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure,\nhas been running below our 2 percent target for a substantial portion of the time period since 2012.[1] At the Dallas\nFed, we particularly focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation, which filters out\nextreme upside and downside moves in inflation components. We believe this measure is a useful indicator of\nunderlying inflation trends. The trimmed mean is currently running at approximately 2.0 percent on a trailing 12month basis and has been in a range of 1.4 to 2.0 percent over the past seven years.[2]\nThe unemployment rate is currently 3.6 percent and has been below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of\nfull employment for two years.[3] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the U-6 measure of unemployment,\nwhich measures the level of unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they would like a job\nbut have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure\nnow stands at 7.3 percent, and is below its 2006 prerecession low of approximately 7.9 percent.[4]\nDallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.25 percent in 2019. While this is slower growth than\nin 2018, it should be sufficient to further tighten the labor market and cause the rate of wage growth to modestly\npick up over the course of 2019. Our economists also expect that, despite some recent weakness in headline and\ncore inflation readings, the headline PCE and Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation are likely to\nfirm, ending the year in the range of 2 percent.\nSome observers have suggested that, with this tight of a labor market, there should be greater wage pressure than\nthe 3.2 percent recent reading of average hourly earnings growth over the past year.[5] They argue that they would\nhave expected wage pressure to have translated into greater price pressure. As most of you know, the Fed has\ninitiated a review of its framework and communication strategy to explore whether there are actions we could take\nto improve our ability to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability.\nWith all this as background, and in light of our ongoing framework review, I thought it would make sense to step\nback and explore some of the potential issues raised by recent weakness in headline and core inflation measures.\nIn particular, I will focus my remarks on labor slack, inflation expectations, and structural forces with regard to how\nthey may be impacting the Fed’s ability to meets its 2 percent inflation objective.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N.

They believe that there may be more scope to attract and retain previously underrepresented groups in the workforce. To support this argument, it is worth noting that, since 2015, increases in\nlabor force participation have disproportionately come from under-represented groups. For example, the\nparticipation rate of the prime-age female population with less than a high school education has increased\nsignificantly, as has the participation rate for black males and Hispanic females.[6]\nIt is also worth noting that the prime-age labor force participation rate in 2018 was 82.0 percent versus 83.1 percent\nin 2008 and 84.1 percent in 1998.[7] If we compare U.S. prime-age labor force participation to other developed\ncountries, we find that the U.S. participation rate lags behind many of these countries, although this gap has begun\nto close somewhat since early 2015.\n\nIs it possible that the strength of the labor market is drawing in workers who have been on the\nsidelines—particularly under-represented groups—and is also encouraging workers to stay in the labor force?[8] Is\nit possible that improvements in skills training, child care availability and transportation availability have drawn, and\ncould still draw, more sidelined workers back into the workforce—and keep them in the workforce?\nIt’s important to recognize that gains in labor force participation act to slow the decline of the unemployment rate.\nAdditionally, recent research—including work done by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Marc Giannoni and Ayşegül\nŞahin—has argued that changes in demographics, especially the aging of the workforce, the aging of firms, as well\nas the increase in the attachment of women to the labor force, may have contributed to a decline in the natural rate\nof unemployment.[9]\nIf this is the case, we may look back five years from now and conclude that the natural rate of unemployment was\nsimply lower than we had been historically accustomed, and that one of the reasons for the perceived surprising\nlack of inflation pressure was due to an excessively high estimate of the equilibrium level of unemployment. In this\nexplanation, the Phillips curve may be alive and well, but the intercept is simply lower than we have previously\nunderstood. If this is true, central bankers need to be vigilant to the possibility that there is still the potential for\ninflation readings to firm substantially, with a time lag, if the degree of full employment overshoot becomes more\nsizeable and persists for an extended period of time.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0507.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fRemarks for Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\nInflation Expectations\nAnother debate relates to the Fed’s ability to manage longer-run inflation expectations. As you all know, the Fed\nhas clearly articulated a 2 percent PCE inflation target. Many would argue that the Fed has done a reasonably good\njob in helping to anchor inflation expectations. They would cite the fact that surveys of professional forecasters’\ninflation expectations are close to 2 percent, and they would suggest that this is not a coincidence; it is a reflection\nof the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy actions and communications, which have been aimed at achieving\nand maintaining full employment while anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at our 2 percent objective.\nHowever, other economists contend that, due to an extended period of inflation running below our 2 percent target,\nexpectations may have drifted somewhat lower. This downward drift might be reflected in the University of Michigan\nsurvey for inflation expectations over the next five years, which has gone from an average of 2.9 percent in 2013 to\n2.5 percent in the 12 months ending April 2019.[10] These economists argue that the Fed may need to do more to\nhelp keep inflation expectations well-anchored. In particular, has the Fed done enough to convince the public that it\nis committed to a symmetrical 2 percent inflation target? Are there changes to the Fed’s policy framework,\ncommunication strategy or other actions the Fed could take to help better anchor inflation expectations at the Fed’s\n2 percent target?\n\nStructural Forces\nAn additional area of exploration deals with structural changes in the U.S. and global economies. In particular, are\nthe forces of technology, technology-enabled disruption and, to some extent, globalization, limiting the pricing\npower of businesses and muting inflation?\nDallas Fed economists recognize that we are living through a period of acceleration in the trend of technology\nreplacing people. We are also seeing the proliferation of new models for selling goods and services—often\ntechnology-enabled (think Amazon, Airbnb, Uber or Lyft)—that replace traditional models for delivering these goods\nand services. These new models are often enabling consumers to buy products and services at prices that are\ndramatically below those of incumbent competitors. To take advantage of this trend, large-platform companies are\nincreasingly bundling products and services—sometimes with little or no gross margin—in order to gain market\nshare.\nAll this is being facilitated by the fact that the consumer now has in the palm of his or her hand more computing\npower than most companies did just 15 years ago. Consumers are able to use this new technology to shop for\ngoods and services at lower prices, often with greater convenience.\nThe impact of these trends means that companies, depending on the industry, often have much less pricing power\nthan they did historically. In response, companies are investing even more in technology that replaces people and,\nincreasingly, taking actions to achieve greater scale in order to effectively manage the investment and margin\nimplications of these trends. The net result is that, in a range of industries, if there is wage pressure, companies are\njust as likely to see margin erosion versus being able to pass these costs on to the customer.\nAs a result of these trends, we are seeing a record level of merger activity by companies in order to get more scale\nto compete in this environment.[11] Companies are using increased debt issuance to fund merger activities to\nachieve greater scale and are also using increased debt issuance to fund accretive share repurchases in order to\nsoften the margin dilution they are experiencing.[12] Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to\ntake steps to merge and fund accretive share repurchases or face replacement of their boards of directors and/or\ntheir executive teams.\nThe workforce is also experiencing the impact of this trend. Highly educated and skilled workers are often seeing\nthe benefits of technology and disruption—depending on their company or industry. However, those workers with a\nhigh school education or less—who lack specific skills training—are increasingly seeing their jobs restructured or\neliminated. This is leading to increasing wealth and income inequality.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0507.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fRemarks for Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\nThis discussion would suggest that powerful structural changes in the economy may be an important aspect of\nmore muted price pressures. Further, there may be some evidence in recent productivity statistics that new\ntechnology and greater economies of scale could be helping to dampen growth in unit labor costs.\n\nImplications\nThe Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is symmetrical—that is, we don’t want inflation to run persistently below or\nabove our 2 percent target. Sustained deviations from our inflation target could increase the likelihood that inflation\nexpectations begin to drift or become unanchored. This could, in turn, make it more difficult for the Fed to achieve\nits dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability.\nIn this context, the various issues raised in this essay merit further discussion and attention. As the Federal\nReserve conducts its ongoing review of our monetary policy framework and communication strategy, the challenge\nwill be to explore potential options for enhancing our policy approach so that we can better achieve our dualmandate objectives.\n\nNotes\n1.

Kaplan\nMarch 05, 2019\nAs a central bank policymaker, I closely monitor various types of excesses and imbalances that may be\ndeveloping in the economy. One of the areas I monitor is the level and growth of indebtedness in the\nhousehold, government and corporate sectors. In previous essays, I have commented on the positive\nimpacts of the deleveraging of the household sector since the Great Recession, and I have raised a\ncautionary flag regarding the growth of U.S. government debt, including a substantial increase in the present\nvalue of unfunded entitlements.\nThe purpose of this essay is to focus on trends in corporate debt growth and credit quality in the U.S. and\ndiscuss potential implications for economic conditions and financial stability.\n\nBackground on Indebtedness in the U.S.\nIn the decade since the Great Recession, there has been an improvement in household balance sheets. In\nparticular, it is estimated that household debt declined from 97 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at\nyear-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[1] This trend has been aided by a strong\njobs market and improving wage growth. This household deleveraging is very important because consumer\nspending is approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP.[2]\nWhile household balance sheets have improved, the U.S. government has become more highly indebted.\nGovernment debt (primarily in the form of Treasury obligations) held by the public as a percentage of GDP\nhas grown from 44 percent at year-end 2008 to approximately 77 percent as of Dec. 31, 2018.[3] In addition,\nthe present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $54 trillion.[4] This growing level of\ngovernment debt as a percentage of GDP means, at a minimum, there is less capacity for infrastructure\nspending and other investments which might help build the productive capability of the U.S. economy. It also\nmeans that in the next downturn, there is likely to be less capacity for fiscal stimulus.\nHistorically, the U.S. government has tended to reduce its degree of leverage when the economy is\nstrong—that has not been the case this cycle. At the later stages of a long economic expansion, recent fiscal\nactions have had the impact of increasing government debt to GDP and have provided meaningful stimulus\nto near-term growth. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that the current path of government debt to GDP is\nunlikely to be sustainable—and if we need to find ways to moderate our debt growth in the future, this\nmoderation is likely to create headwinds for GDP growth.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0305.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fCorporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 2 of 9\n\nIn addition to household and government debt, Dallas Fed economists also keep track of the level and growth\nof corporate debt in the financial sector as well as the nonfinancial sector of the U.S. economy. On the\npositive side, U.S. financial sector debt has declined substantially from near its historical peak of\napproximately 124 percent of GDP at the end of 2008 to 78 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[5] This decline was\naccompanied by substantially more stringent postcrisis financial sector regulations and oversight intended to\nreduce the systemic risk and improve the resiliency of the U.S. financial sector.\nBy contrast, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is now higher than the prior peak\nreached at the end of 2008. As seen in Chart 1, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP\ndeclined substantially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but then rebounded from a postrecession low\nof approximately 40 percent in 2010 to 46 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[6],[7]\n\nThis rebound in the amount of nonfinancial corporate debt is something I am carefully considering in\nassessing economic conditions and financial stability in the U.S. In particular, it is worth noting that a number\nof research studies have indicated that relatively higher levels of corporate debt to GDP could potentially\namplify the severity of a recession.[8] Several of these papers also suggest that strong growth in corporate\ndebt to GDP is more likely to amplify a downturn when corporate leverage is historically elevated, as it is\ntoday.[9]\n\nTrends in Nonfinancial Corporate Debt\nNonfinancial corporate debt consists primarily of bonds and loans (commercial paper outstanding is less than\n5 percent of the total). Nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding in the U.S. grew from approximately $2.2\ntrillion in 2008 to approximately $5.7 trillion at year-end 2018 (Chart 2). The bulk of this growth occurred in\nthe investment-grade sector. The amount of outstanding U.S. investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds\ngrew from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2008 to $4.5 trillion at year-end 2018.[10]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0305.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fCorporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 3 of 9\n\nWithin the investment-grade sector, there was a notable increase in the amount of BBB bonds (the lowest\nlevel of investment-grade debt) outstanding, growing from approximately $0.8 trillion in 2008 to $2.7 trillion by\nyear-end 2018.[11] In addition, the amount of high-yield (less than investment grade) nonfinancial corporate\nbonds outstanding grew from approximately $0.7 trillion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion by year-end 2018. This\nsubstantial growth in BBB and lower-rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the\nU.S.\nIt is estimated that a substantial portion of the increase in nonfinancial corporate debt was used to fund share\nbuybacks, dividends and merger activity.[12] This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and\nloan covenants,[13] which have had the effect of reducing protections for investors.\n\nThere has also been an increase in syndicated leveraged loans over this period. Leveraged loans are loans\nmade to highly indebted companies and are typically originated by commercial banks and then syndicated to\nnonbank investors, including special-purpose vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), private\nequity funds and other stand-alone entities. The size of the syndicated leveraged loan market, which is\nprimarily made up of nonfinancial corporate borrowers, has increased from $0.6 trillion at the end of 2008 to\n$1.2 trillion at year-end 2018.[14] Much of this increase has occurred to fund corporate acquisitions and\nprivate-equity-backed transactions.[15]\nIn addition to the syndicated leveraged loan market, there is also a direct lending market for leveraged loans\nin the U.S. This market primarily involves nonbank financial firms—such as asset managers, private equity\nfunds, business development corporations (BDCs), hedge funds, insurance companies and pension\nfunds—lending directly to smaller, mid-market companies. While it is difficult to obtain precise information on\nthe size of this market, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) estimates that the amount of outstanding leveraged loans\nin the U.S. direct lending market has grown significantly over the past several years and now likely exceeds\nseveral hundred billion dollars.[16]\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0305.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fCorporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 4 of 9\n\nCLO Structure\nCLOs are investment vehicles that buy pools of floating-rate leveraged loans from banks. The CLO packages\nloans into tranches of debt with credit ratings ranging from AAA to BB and with one nonrated tranche of\nequity, as illustrated in Chart 3. These tranches are securitized and then sold primarily to institutional\ninvestors.\n\nThe ability of a CLO to turn lower-credit-quality loans into mostly investment-grade-rated bonds via\nsecuritization hinges on three key factors: 1) overcollateralization, 2) tranching of securities based on levels\nof subordination, and 3) portfolio diversification. As loans are paid off, the income flows to the buyers of the\nCLO securities. In case of a default in one of the underlying loans, the lowest tranche (equity) is the first to\nexperience a loss, whereas the AAA tranche would be the last to experience a loss. Unlike mortgage-backed\nsecurities, the CLO structure proved relatively resilient during 2008–09.\nThe U.S. CLO market has grown from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2008 to $615 billion at the end of\n2018.[17] However, it is important to recognize that CLO loan-credit quality today is estimated to be\nsomewhat weaker than 10 years ago.\nS&P estimates that in 2018, CLOs and loan mutual funds purchased approximately 60 percent and 20\npercent, respectively, of syndicated leveraged loan volumes. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of new\nissuance was purchased by banks in the U.S. The remaining volumes were purchased by insurance\ncompanies, finance companies and others.[18] Because CLOs are today the largest buyer of these\nsyndicated leveraged loans, disruptions to CLO creation could increase the likelihood that leveraged loans\nremain on bank balance sheets, which could, in turn, limit the ability of affected banks to extend credit during\nperiods of stress.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0305.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fCorporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 5 of 9\n\nImplications of Rising Levels of BBB and Less-than-Investment-Grade Corporate\nDebt\nAs a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the\nevent of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality\ndeteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were\nsufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for\ngreater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that\ncould, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy.\nIn a downturn, some proportion of BBB bonds may be at risk of being downgraded to less than investment\ngrade. These downgrades, if they happen in sufficient size, could create dislocations for investors who tend\nto have specific allocations or restrictions based on credit-rating categories. These dislocations could further\nnegatively impact credit spreads and market access for more highly indebted companies.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0305.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fCorporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 6 of 9\n\nMarket Liquidity\nOne further issue is whether there is sufficient liquidity in the various corporate debt markets. Ample liquidity\nis particularly important in the event of market stress or dislocation.\nWhile there is debate regarding the evidence of a decline in various measures of corporate bond market\nliquidity—such as round-trip trading costs, bid–ask spreads or turnover[19]—it is generally agreed that bankaffiliated broker-dealers have been committing less capital to corporate bond trading since the financial crisis.\nIn particular, it is estimated that inventories of corporate debt held by broker-dealers declined from $29.2\nbillion at the end of 2013 to $14.2 billion at the end of 2018.[20]\nThis decline is notable given that the total corporate bond market increased 36 percent over this period. The\ndecline in inventories held by broker-dealers may be due, at least in part, to postcrisis regulation, such as the\nVolcker rule (effective April 2014), as well as the growth in electronic trading and other market-related factors.\n[21]\nIn the event of an economic downturn and some credit-quality deterioration, the reduction in bank brokerdealer inventories and market-making capability could mean that credit spreads might widen more\nsignificantly, and potentially in a more volatile manner, than they have historically. This concern may be\nsomewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10\nyears.\n\nConclusion: Continued Vigilance\nI will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted\nas these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an\neconomic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could,\nin turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy.\nI am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S.\ngovernment debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of\ncorporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is\nmuch more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.\n\nNotes\n1.

Kaplan\nFebruary 05, 2019\nIn the January 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate\nunchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent and communicated that it “will be patient” as it determines what\nfuture adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.\nThe FOMC also issued a “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet\nNormalization,” which reflects our decision to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which\ncontrol over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised via a so-called “floor system” with an ample supply\nof reserves.[1] The Committee also said that it is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance\nsheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\nThe FOMC began the process of gradually reducing the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. Through\nJanuary, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by approximately $400 billion.\n\nOverview\nThe U.S. economy, as measured by real gross domestic product (GDP), is estimated to have grown\napproximately 3 percent in 2018. However, various economic and financial uncertainties have emerged over\nthe past several months. I believe that these developments merit close monitoring—and have the potential to\nimpact the economic outlook.\nAfter approximately 115 months of economic expansion and nine federal funds rate increases over the past\nthree years, I believe that we are at a critical juncture in terms of monetary policy. It is my view that the Fed\nshould be exhibiting patience. In particular, I believe that we should take no further action on the federal\nfunds rate until there is greater clarity regarding a number of uncertainties relating to the economic outlook\nand development of financial conditions.\nIn addition, consistent with our January “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance\nSheet Normalization,” I believe it is highly appropriate for us to be open to adjusting the details of our\nnormalization plans based on our ongoing assessments of the economic outlook and financial conditions. My\nFOMC colleagues and I will continue to analyze and discuss the appropriate size and composition of the\nbalance sheet—and will be working toward making decisions on these issues over the coming months.\n\nEconomic Conditions\nU.S. economic growth in 2018 was aided by sizable fiscal stimulus and strong consumer spending.\nAdditionally, for much of the year, business fixed investment and solid global growth provided tailwinds to\nU.S. GDP growth.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0205.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fThe Value of Patience - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\nBased on underlying employment data as well as discussions with business contacts, it is my view that the\nU.S. labor market is extremely tight by historical standards. The unemployment rate in December was 3.9\npercent, and the U-6 rate was 7.6 percent. This U-6 reading was lower than the prerecession low of 7.9\npercent in 2006 (U-6 comprises the unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they\nwould like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who would prefer to work full\ntime).\nIn January, the unemployment rate increased to 4.0 percent, and U-6 jumped to 8.1 percent. The labor force\nparticipation rate increased to 63.2 percent. Dallas Fed economists have cautioned that the January increase\nin the unemployment rate and the substantial rise in U-6 were likely influenced by the partial federal\ngovernment shutdown and may well reverse in the coming months. In particular, we would note the unusual\njump in the number of people working part time who would prefer to work full time; this measure increased by\napproximately 500,000 and may reflect, at least in part, government workers and contractors seeking\nalternative employment during the shutdown.\nI believe that the Federal Reserve is meeting its inflation mandate. The most recent reading of the Dallas Fed\nTrimmed Mean, our preferred measure of core inflation, was approximately 2 percent for the 12 months\nending in November. This measure, which exes out extreme price movements to the upside and downside,\nprovides a reliable gauge of underlying inflation trends. Given the tightness in the labor market, it is\nnoteworthy that core inflation has not risen more sharply.\nMy own view is that the structural forces of automation and technology-enabled disruption as well as\nglobalization are limiting the pricing power of businesses and having a dampening effect on inflation. It is also\nmy view that while cyclical inflationary pressures have been building due to a tightening labor market, the\nimpact of these structural forces is also intensifying. Based on these cross-currents, I expect inflationary\npressures to remain somewhat muted; I don’t expect inflation to run away from us.\n\nCautionary Signs and Uncertainties\nAs we begin 2019, I see several cautionary signs that bear close scrutiny. First, global growth is decelerating.\nFor example, China’s purchasing managers indexes have continued to weaken, and the European Central\nBank has continued to downgrade its projections for economic growth in the euro zone for 2019. While the\nworld economy (excluding the U.S.) grew 3.4 percent in 2017, growth is estimated to have declined to 3.0\npercent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 2.7 percent in 2019.[2] Measures of world export growth\nand industrial production (excluding the U.S.) also decelerated during 2018.\nIt is my view that slowing economic growth outside the U.S. has the potential to ultimately spill over into\neconomic growth in the U.S. I am particularly mindful of the fact that approximately 45 percent of S&P 500\ncompany revenues come from outside the United States and that a variety of U.S. industries rely heavily on\nexports to China, Europe and other regions of the world. Slower economic growth outside the U.S. means\nthat there is less foreign demand for goods and services originating in the U.S. In addition, a substantial\nnumber of U.S. companies are highly reliant on global logistics and supply-chain arrangements. If those\narrangements are more uncertain due to trade tensions, this can create challenges for domestic firms in\nmanaging profit margins and have a chilling effect on capital spending plans by these firms.\nIn the U.S., interest-sensitive industries are showing signs of weakness. As of November, new single-family\nbuilding permits were down 4.3 percent from their February 2018 expansion peak. Sales of existing singlefamily homes, which hit 5.05 million in November 2017, were down 11.9 percent to 4.45 million as of\nDecember 2018.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0205.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fThe Value of Patience - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\nRecent national and regional surveys of manufacturing activity also indicate signs of slowing. The Institute for\nSupply Management manufacturing index indicated meaningfully slower growth in December and, to a lesser\nextent, January. This slowing was also reflected in Federal Reserve Bank surveys from the Dallas, Kansas\nCity, New York and Richmond regions.\nIn addition, recent surveys of consumer sentiment have fallen. In January, the Conference Board Consumer\nConfidence Index fell to its lowest level since July 2017, and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment\nIndex declined to its lowest level since October 2016, attributed in part to concerns about the partial federal\ngovernment shutdown.\nIt is the view of our economists at the Dallas Fed that the negative impact of the recent shutdown on\neconomic activity and unemployment should substantially reverse in the coming months—this, of course,\nassumes the shutdown does not resume in the coming weeks. Our judgment doesn’t take into account any\nheightening of business and consumer uncertainty that might persist as a result of the shutdown.\nSince early October, financial conditions in the U.S. have tightened. For example, high-yield spreads\nincreased from approximately 3.15 percent to 5.30 percent between early October and December 31, and\nthen retraced somewhat to approximately 4.40 percent by January 31. U.S. high-yield corporate bond\nissuance declined 39 percent in 2018. The average level of monthly high-yield issuance was approximately\n$16.9 billion through October 2018 but declined to $3.6 billion in November and $0.6 billion in December\nbefore rebounding to approximately $19.9 billion in January.\nFor the past year, Dallas Fed economists have expected that 2019 growth would slow from 2018 levels. We\nexpected this slowing due to waning fiscal stimulus heading into 2019 as well as the impact of Federal\nReserve rate increases that tend to impact the economy with a lag. We have also highlighted the powerful\nstructural headwinds of slowing workforce growth due to aging of the population as well as sluggish\nproductivity growth due in part to lagging education and skill levels in the U.S.\nSince early December, Dallas Fed economists have lowered our base-case forecast for 2019 GDP growth to\napproximately 2 percent. Of course, we are cognizant of ongoing risks to this outlook that include trade\ntensions as well as the other uncertainties discussed earlier.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nI believe the Federal Reserve has made good progress in achieving its dual-mandate objectives of maximum\nsustainable employment and price stability. In addition, we have made progress in normalizing monetary\npolicy and in reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nI am mindful of the fact that GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity.\nThe current economic expansion has now lasted for nearly 10 years, and we are likely somewhat late in the\nbusiness cycle, with relatively less spare labor-force capacity to help support continued robust growth.\nI believe that the Treasury yield curve is sending cautionary signals regarding expectations for medium- and\nlonger-term GDP growth. These sluggish expectations are reflective of key structural headwinds discussed in\nthis as well as previous essays, which include: 1) aging-population demographics that are likely creating\nslower workforce growth, 2) limited improvements in productivity growth due in part to lagging education and\nskill levels in the U.S., and 3) high levels of corporate and federal government debt in the U.S. that are\nstimulative on the way up but can create impediments to growth if debt levels need to be moderated. Further,\nit is our view at the Dallas Fed that globalization is likely an opportunity to achieve higher levels of economic\ngrowth and that some resolution of current trade tensions is critical to seizing this opportunity.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2200 N. Pearl St., Dallas, Texas 75201 | 214.922.6000 or 800.333.4460\n\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0205.aspx\n\n5/26/2020\n\n\fThe Value of Patience - Dallasfed.org\n\nPage 4 of 4\n\nThe Value of Patience\nBased on these various factors, and in light of the uncertainties described in this note, I believe it would be\nprudent for the Fed to exercise patience and refrain from taking further action on the federal funds rate until\nthe economic outlook becomes somewhat clearer. I expect we will get some further clarity during the first half\nof 2019.\nIn addition, it is my expectation that inflation readings will remain somewhat muted in 2019. As I mentioned\nearlier, it is my view that the structural forces of automation, technology-enabled disruption and globalization\nwill continue to offset, at least in part, the cyclical pressures created by a historically tight labor market. As a\nresult, I believe the Fed has the luxury of being patient over the next several months. Exercising patience will\nbe critical if we are to achieve our dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price\nstability.\n\nNotes\n1. “The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of\nreserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is\nexercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not required,” quote from the “Statement Regarding Monetary\nPolicy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, Jan. 30, 2019.\n2.

            "content": "The Neutral Rate of Interest\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate to a range of 2 to 2.25 percent. In our\nstatement announcing the decision, we ceased to include language that described the current stance of monetary policy as “accommodative.”\nI supported the most recent federal funds rate increase. In my recent speeches and essays, I have been arguing that the Federal Reserve should be\ngradually and patiently raising the federal funds rate until we get into the range of a “neutral stance.” Once we’ve reached that point, I intend to assess the\noutlook for the U.S. economy and look at a broad range of factors before deciding what further actions, if any, might then be appropriate.\nOne challenge in moving toward a neutral stance is the inherently imprecise and uncertain nature of estimating what constitutes “neutral.” This judgment is\nmore of an art than a science and involves observing and analyzing a wide variety of factors. The uncertainty of this judgment is complicated by the fact that\n2018 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been substantially aided by sizable fiscal stimulus, whose impact is likely to fade somewhat in 2019 and\nfurther in 2020.\nThe purpose of this essay is to explore a number of the key issues associated with using the neutral rate concept in formulating monetary policy. In particular,\nI will discuss several of the challenges associated with estimating this rate, describe limitations on the use of this concept, and explain how it might best be\nused in debating and determining the appropriate path for the U.S. federal funds rate.\n\nWhat Is the Neutral Rate?\nThe neutral rate is the theoretical federal funds rate at which the stance of Federal Reserve monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. It is the\nshort-term real interest rate consistent with the economy maintaining full employment with associated price stability.\nYou won’t find the neutral rate quoted on your computer screen or in the financial section of the newspaper. The neutral rate is an “inferred” rate—that is, it is\nestimated based on various analyses and observations.\nThis rate is not static. It is a dynamic rate that varies based on a range of economic and financial market factors. A number of economists inside as well as\noutside the Federal Reserve System do extensive work to model and estimate this rate. While the estimates produced by these models can differ\nsubstantially, they all typically draw on a variety of inputs which reflect, to varying degrees, prospects for U.S. economic growth, global growth and various\naspects of overall financial conditions. (See the Appendix, “Modeling the Neutral Rate.”)\nThe neutral rate can be measured for different time horizons. Estimates of the “shorter-run” neutral rate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers of\nnear-term GDP growth such as changes in current fiscal policy.\nEstimates of the “longer-run” neutral rate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers which reflect more enduring secular factors such as expected\nmedium-term growth in the workforce and the expected rate of increase in labor productivity. Productivity growth, in turn, is influenced by investment in\ncapital equipment and technology, regulatory policies, and policies which impact the education and skill levels of the U.S. workforce. In addition, the longerrun neutral rate is likely to be influenced by trends in the global supply and demand for safe and liquid financial assets.\nTo illustrate the difference between short- and long-run measures, I will use an example regarding fiscal policy. If the federal government passes a substantial\ntax cut or increases government spending, it may create a short-term stimulus that materially increases near-term GDP, which will likely be accompanied by\nan increase in the shorter-run neutral rate. However, if these policies do not fundamentally increase the medium- or longer-term growth potential of the U.S.\neconomy, they may have only a marginal impact on the longer-run neutral rate.\nIn assessing the stance of monetary policy and making judgments about the future path of the federal funds rate, I prefer to focus on measures of the neutral\nrate that de-emphasize the impact of more volatile, shorter-run transitory factors. I tend to focus more on a range of indicators that reflect the sustainable\n(medium-term and longer-run) growth potential for the U.S. economy.\n\nWhy Is the Neutral Rate Important?\nDespite the fact that judging the level of the neutral rate is inherently uncertain and imprecise, many of us at the Federal Reserve pay close attention to the\nvarious models that seek to estimate this rate. The reason is that, despite the relatively wide confidence bands around these estimates, they can provide an\nindication, albeit imperfect, of whether our monetary stance is accommodative, neutral or restrictive. Making a judgment on the stance of monetary policy is a\nkey part of my job as a central banker.\nMonetary policy is accommodative when the federal funds rate is below the neutral rate. When this is the case, economic slack will tend to diminish—the\neconomy will tend to grow faster, the unemployment rate should decline and inflation should tend to rise. When the federal funds rate is above the neutral\nrate, monetary policy is restrictive. When this is the case, economic slack will tend to increase—economic growth will tend to slow, the unemployment rate\nshould tend to rise and the rate of inflation should be more muted or decline. The challenge for the Federal Reserve is managing this process and getting the\nbalance right.\n\n\fA good analogy is comparing this judgment to the assessment you typically make in approaching an intersection while driving your car. Should you be\npressing on the accelerator, easing off the accelerator or pressing your foot on the brakes? In this analogy, being accommodative is equivalent to pressing on\nthe accelerator; being restrictive is equivalent to stepping on the brakes. If the Federal Reserve is raising the federal funds rate in order to remove\naccommodation and move toward a neutral stance, this is analogous to easing your foot off the accelerator. Every driver is familiar with making these\njudgments even though they are inherently imprecise and uncertain—and tend to be made through “feel” by assessing a variety of factors.\nWhile I look at the more volatile and imprecise measures of the shorter-run neutral rate, I am hesitant to base my monetary policy judgments on these\npotentially transitory fluctuations. I prefer to adjust the federal funds rate in response to my assessments of economic conditions, including my outlook for\ninflation, in a patient and gradual manner. This approach is more consistent with greater emphasis on my estimates of the longer-run neutral rate.\nAs mentioned earlier, because monetary policy acts with a lag, policymakers have to make judgments on the stance and direction of policy well in advance,\njust as a driver has to make a decision to speed up or slow down well before reaching an intersection. When driving, if you wait too long to ease up on the\naccelerator, and consequently need to slam on the brakes, you risk losing control of your vehicle. Similarly, keeping monetary policy accommodative for too\nlong can lead to creation of excesses and imbalances that can be very difficult to address—and can create a need for the Federal Reserve to play “catch-up,”\nwhich has historically increased the probability of recession. History has shown that some moderation can, in fact, increase the likelihood of extending an\neconomic expansion.\n\nA Reality Check: Historical Trends in Global Interest Rates\nAs a reality check on estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, I find it very useful to look at trends in market-determined interest rates—which are not\ntheoretical and can be observed. For example, it is worth noting that nominal yields on long-term bonds in the Group of Seven (G-7) countries—Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States—have recently touched their lowest levels in the past 150 years (Chart 1). One\ndriver of the decline in nominal yields since the 1970s is likely a significant reduction in longer-run inflation expectations.\n\nChanges in inflation-adjusted global government bond yields should, over time, reflect changes in the longer-run neutral real rate of interest. After adjusting\nfor inflation, the real interest rates on safe and liquid assets—primarily global government bonds of various countries—have declined significantly over the\npast 30 years, a decline that precedes the Great Recession. Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that this decline in real interest rates is likely due to\nlower rates of trend economic growth in these various countries, at least partly as a result of demographic shifts (particularly aging populations) and lower\nrates of trend productivity growth.[1]\nAnother major factor in the downward trend in bond yields is the substantial growth in worldwide demand for safe and liquid assets arising from a\nconsiderable increase in the size of pension funds, global central bank balance sheets, and other fixed-income investment pools. When global investors look\nfor safety and liquidity, they naturally gravitate to U.S. Treasury bonds as well as other sovereign obligations.\nAs financial markets have become much more globally integrated, the search for safe assets has increasingly become global. In this search, much has been\nmade of the shortage of safe assets in which these global pools of money can be invested. The impact has been to drive down interest rates on government\ndebt in the U.S. as well as globally. Dallas Fed economist Marc Giannoni and his research co-authors have argued that the increased demand for safety and\nliquidity explains a decline of more than 60 basis points in long-term real rates around the world over the past two decades.[2]\nIt stands to reason that, as global interest rates decline, our estimates of the neutral rate of interest have also correspondingly declined.\n\nNeutral Rate Uncertainty and the Challenge of Forecasting Productivity Growth\n\n\fAs I mentioned earlier, I tend to view estimates of shorter-run and longer-run neutral rates as just one factor among several indicators which influence my\nassessment of the stance of monetary policy. I also rely on my regular conversations with a broad range of business contacts, our Federal Reserve business\nsurveys, assessments of labor market dynamics, inflation indicators, the behavior of various financial market indicators and the shape of the yield curve in\nassessing overall economic conditions.\nIn this context, I use estimates of the neutral rate as part of an overall mosaic of indicators which help shape my overall assessments of current and future\neconomic activity. When looking at neutral rate estimates, I am highly cognizant that there is likely to be significant disagreement between different models,\nand their outputs can be volatile based on changes in economic and financial conditions. I always keep in mind that these estimates are inherently uncertain\nand imprecise.\nOne reason for the uncertainty and imprecision is that potential GDP growth is a key driver of the neutral rate—and this is inherently challenging to forecast.\nGDP growth is comprised of growth in the labor force plus growth in the rate of productivity. I would emphasize that, while economists are reasonably\nproficient in estimating likely changes in labor force growth, it is far more difficult and challenging for economists to anticipate changes in the sustainable rate\nof improvement in productivity.\nIf the rate of workforce growth is likely to slow, can this be offset by improvements in productivity? Higher rates of sustained productivity growth would mean,\nall things being equal, a higher neutral interest rate. The uncertainty regarding future improvements in productivity creates uncertainty for estimates of the\nneutral rate of interest. Chart 2 illustrates the difficulty in forecasting productivity growth by comparing actual productivity growth in the U.S. versus forecasts.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nCurrently, with the U.S. unemployment rate at approximately 3.7 percent and the headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rate of inflation at\nslightly more than 2 percent, I believe that the Federal Reserve is achieving its dual-mandate objectives.\nAs we reach our dual-mandate objectives, I believe that the Federal Reserve should be gradually easing off the accelerator—we no longer need to be\nstimulating the U.S. economy. As such, I believe we should be gradually and patiently moving toward a neutral policy stance.\nDue to improvements in expectations for near-term U.S. economic growth, estimates of the shorter-run neutral rate have risen over the past 12 months.\nHowever, because these shorter-run estimates are subject to great uncertainty and can be heavily influenced by near-term transitory factors, I tend to focus a\nbit more heavily on expectations for medium- and longer-term growth in the U.S. economy. As a consequence, estimates of the longer-run neutral rate weigh\nmore heavily on my thinking.\nAs mentioned earlier, it is our expectation at the Dallas Fed that the impact of recent fiscal stimulus, which has substantially contributed to 2018 economic\ngrowth, is likely to wane somewhat in 2019 and further in 2020. At the same time that the recent stimulus begins to wane, our Dallas Fed economists believe\nthat the rate of workforce growth, a key driver of longer-term GDP growth, is likely to slow due to aging-population demographics.\nA key question is whether this slowing in workforce growth will be offset by improvements in the rate of productivity growth in the U.S. How the rate of\nproductivity growth unfolds in 2019 and 2020, and beyond, will have a significant impact on future GDP growth. Because the sustainable rate of productivity\ngrowth is inherently difficult to predict, I have been somewhat cautious in my judgments regarding the appropriate pace and ultimate level of the federal funds\nrate.\nTo help make these assessments, I carefully monitor the Treasury yield curve. This curve serves as a reality check for my outlook regarding the U.S. and\nglobal economies. As of the date of this essay, the one-year Treasury rate stands at 2.65 percent, the two-year stands at 2.88 percent and the 10-year and\n30-year Treasury rates are at 3.15 percent and 3.36 percent, respectively.[3] In my opinion, the one- and two-year short-term rates are substantially reflective\n\n\fof communications by the Federal Reserve regarding our expectations for the path of the federal funds rate. I think those expectations are heavily priced into\nthese shorter-term Treasury securities. While I believe the more muted rise in the 10- and 30-year Treasuries is reflective of a substantial amount of global\nliquidity and demand for safe assets, I also think the yield levels of these securities are consistent with more sluggish expectations for future economic\ngrowth in the U.S. and globally.\nI am also cognizant that the 10-year Treasury has recently moved from 2.90 percent at the beginning of September to 3.15 percent today.[4] This may reflect\nseveral factors, including greater optimism regarding the prospects for future GDP growth.\nEach of us around the FOMC table submits quarterly, as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (sometimes referred to as the SEP or the “dot plot”),\nour best judgments regarding the appropriate path for the federal funds rate and the “longer-run” federal funds rate. My longer-run rate submission is my best\nestimate of the longer-run neutral rate for the U.S. economy. In the September SEP, the range of submissions by FOMC participants for the longer-run rate\nwas 2.5 to 3.5 percent, and the median estimate was 3.0 percent.\nMy own estimate of the longer-run neutral rate is modestly below the median of the estimates made by my colleagues. My suggested rate path for 2019 is\nalso modestly below the 3 to 3.25 percent median of the ranges suggested by my fellow FOMC participants. My SEP estimates are consistent with my recent\npublic statements which indicated that my base case for 2019 is to gradually and patiently raise the federal funds rate into a range of 2.5 to 2.75 percent or,\nmore likely, into a range of 2.75 to 3 percent.\nOf course, my judgments regarding both the stance of monetary policy and the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are subject to change based on\nincoming economic and financial inputs which will either confirm or cause me to adjust my views. In particular, as we proceed along this path, I will be\nregularly assessing the outlook for the U.S. economy and also closely monitoring prospects for global economic growth, as well as reviewing indicators of\noverall financial conditions and a range of other factors in order to update my judgments regarding the appropriate pace and precise number of moves\nnecessary to get to a neutral stance.\nI intend to avoid prejudging what, if any, further actions we should take once we get into the range of our best estimate of a neutral stance. I intend to make\nthat judgment sometime in the spring or summer of 2019 based on the economic outlook at that time.\n\nConclusion\nMy purpose in writing this essay has been to discuss the neutral rate, explore several of the key issues surrounding this concept, and point out that it is just\none aspect of assessing the stance of U.S. monetary policy. It is worth emphasizing that there are limitations to using the neutral rate concept—estimates of\nthe neutral rate are imprecise and uncertain, as are estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, potential GDP and other theoretical concepts we utilize to\njudge the state of the U.S. economy. One key reason for uncertainty regarding estimates of the neutral rate is the difficulty in predicting future changes in the\nsustainable rate of productivity growth.\nDespite its inherent uncertainties, I believe that the neutral rate concept is a useful tool. However, because it has limitations, it is best used in conjunction with\na broad range of other economic analyses as well as extensive conversations with private sector leaders and a focus on identifying and differentiating\nbetween cyclical and structural drivers of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nAPPENDIX\nModeling the Neutral Rate (r*)\nThere are various models in use inside and outside the Federal Reserve that produce estimates of r*. One estimate I closely monitor is produced by Federal\nReserve economist Thomas Laubach and New York Fed President John Williams.[5] Another estimate is done by Dallas Fed economist Evan Koenig along\nwith Alan Armen,[6] and yet another is produced by Dallas Fed Research Director Marc Giannoni along with Marco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone and\nAndrea Tambalotti (referred to as “DGGT” in Chart A-1) of the New York Fed.[7]\nThese models differ in terms of their structural assumptions and the data they use to produce estimates of the neutral rate. For example, Laubach–Williams\nuses data on real GDP, core PCE inflation, oil prices, import prices and the federal funds rate as inputs for their model. This model attempts to estimate an\noutput gap to assess the neutral rate of interest. The Koenig model uses data on long-term bond yields, survey measures of long-term GDP growth and longterm inflation as inputs for its estimates of long-run r*. Giannoni’s model uses a broad set of key macroeconomic and financial data series to generate\nestimates of the neutral rate at different time horizons.[8] Chart A-1 provides a summary of the outputs of these models over the past 30 years.\n\n\fWhile these models produce estimates which can vary widely, they all agree that the longer-run neutral rate of interest has declined over the past several\nyears in comparison with the period 1985–2005. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that drivers of the declines in estimates of the longer-run neutral rate\ninclude lower trend GDP growth due to relatively sluggish productivity growth and to demographics—namely, an aging population, which slows workforce\ngrowth. Increased global demand for safe, liquid assets also contributes to the decline in estimates.\nSeparately, our economists find that their shorter-run r* estimates now exceed their longer-run estimates (see Chart A-2 for estimates of shorter-run r*). They\nattribute this divergence to recent fiscal stimulus and other factors that have boosted the confidence of households and firms, leading them to borrow and\ninvest.\n\nNotes\n\n\fThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.

            "content": "Where We Stand: Assessment of Economic Conditions and Implications for Monetary\nPolicy\nAugust 21, 2018\n\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the committee agreed to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. Our August\n1 statement characterized the current stance of monetary policy as “accommodative” and described growth in economic activity and employment as “strong.”\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and\nsouthern New Mexico. Texas accounts for approximately 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment. It\nis the largest energy-producing state in the U.S. as well as the nation’s largest exporting state.[1] It is home to approximately 50 Fortune 500 companies and\nnumerous industry-leading small and mid-sized firms. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insight into energy, trade and immigration\nissues as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss economic conditions in the Eleventh District and the U.S. I will also discuss the implications of this assessment for the\nstance of monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nEconomic Conditions\nThe Eleventh District\nTexas jobs increased at an annualized rate of approximately 3.2 percent for the first seven months of 2018. This rate of job growth is estimated to be the\nsecond-highest of any state in the nation. Dallas Fed economists expect Texas jobs to increase nearly 3 percent for the full-year 2018. This strong rate of\ngrowth is broad based geographically and across industries. While growth is highly diversified, the energy sector is adding jobs at a faster rate than any other\nindustry. Our Texas Business Outlook Surveys lend further evidence to continued widespread and broad-based expansion.[2]\nThe Texas economy continues to benefit from domestic migration (as well as immigration) of people and the movement of firms to the state. Aided by this\ntrend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified and its population continues to grow rapidly. The population of Texas is now approaching\napproximately 29 million. This population growth has been associated with faster workforce growth than in other states in the U.S., which has helped fuel the\ndistrict’s very strong rate of economic growth.\nEnergy Industry. Due to the significant industrial diversification in the state, the energy industry now accounts for approximately 9.4 percent of Texas GDP.\nThe state’s energy production, transmission and refining industries have expanded considerably over the past few years. Due to substantial growth in the\nPermian Basin, the United States is now producing approximately 10.7 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d) and is expected to produce approximately 11.2\nmb/d by the end of 2018.[3] This compares with current production in Russia of approximately 11.2 mb/d and in Saudi Arabia of 10.4 mb/d.[4] Texas is the\nlargest oil-producing state in the U.S. and accounts for a significant percentage of U.S. production growth. The state is expected to produce approximately\n4.7 mb/d by year-end. As a geographic entity, Texas would be the fourth-largest oil producer in the world.[5]\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in rough balance. Due to growth in global demand for oil, lack of investment in\nlong-lived production projects over the past several years, and various production constraints (particularly pipeline capacity, worker shortages and other\ninfrastructure challenges) in the Permian Basin as well as outages due to geopolitical issues (e.g., Iran and Venezuela), we believe that we are more likely to\nmove to a global undersupply situation in the years ahead—with oil price risk tilted to the upside. These elements underpin our forecasts that Texas oil\nproduction, even with constraints, will grow substantially over the next several years.\nThe Outlook. Based on all these factors, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the prospects for Eleventh District growth in the short and medium\nterm. However, worker shortages as well as U.S. trade policy, particularly regarding NAFTA, are issues that could negatively impact the outlook. Research by\nDallas Fed economists indicates that the U.S. trading relationship with Mexico is substantially an “intermediate goods” relationship—part of integrated supply\nchain and logistics relationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to keep jobs in this country and increase their global competitiveness.[6] It is our view\nthat without these trading relationships, the U.S. would likely lose market share to other countries, particularly in Asia. Based on this research, we are very\nhopeful that NAFTA will ultimately be modernized and that the basic elements of this trading relationship will be reaffirmed in a new NAFTA agreement.\nU.S. Economy\nU.S. GDP is estimated to have grown at a 3.1 percent annual rate over the first half of 2018. Rising consumer spending accounted for a little less than half of\nthis growth, and unusually strong contributions from nonresidential business investment (approximately 1.2 percentage points) and net exports\n(approximately 0.5 percentage points) also contributed to growth. Dallas Fed economists forecast full-year GDP growth of approximately 3 percent. Based on\nthis forecast, we expect the headline unemployment rate to reach 3.7 percent by year-end. In addition, we expect that headline personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation will remain in the neighborhood of the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target during the remainder of 2018.\nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 3.9 percent. Despite job growth averaging 224,000 per month over the past three months, the unemployment rate\nremains the same as in April due to a strong flow of net entrants into the labor force. While our economists are hopeful that a strong labor market might\ncontinue to draw in new entrants who are currently out of the workforce, it is our base-case view that the current rate of labor force growth is unlikely to\n\n\fcontinue and that the unemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 3.5 percent by the second quarter of 2019. In short, it is our judgment that we are\nin a tight labor market and are already past the level of full employment in the U.S. This tightness is likely to increasingly constrain economic growth.\nCurrently, the headline PCE inflation rate stands at approximately 2.2 percent for the 12 months ending June 2018. As mentioned earlier, Dallas Fed\neconomists expect inflation to remain around the Federal Reserve’s longer-run PCE inflation target of 2 percent through the end of the year. The Dallas Fed\ntracks a number of measures beyond headline inflation to gauge overall inflation trends. In particular, Dallas Fed economists have developed the Trimmed\nMean PCE inflation rate, which is a core inflation measure that, each month, excludes the most extreme upward and downward price movements. This\nmeasure now stands at 1.9 percent, and we expect it to reach 2 percent by the end of 2018.\nDue to the tight labor market as well as higher input costs, it is my view that cyclical forces are creating upward pressure on inflation. However, I also believe\nthat strong structural forces (discussed below)—particularly automation and globalization—are helping to mute the inflationary impact of these cyclical forces.\nThese crosscurrents are worth keeping in mind as we continue to consider the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nBased on this forecast, it is my judgment that the Federal Reserve is meeting its full employment and price stability objectives. As such, we should be\nremoving accommodation in a gradual manner in order to get to a neutral policy stance.\n\nThe Neutral Rate\nThe neutral rate of interest is the federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. It is a theoretical concept, meaning\nthat it can’t be directly observed—it must be inferred from market and other economic data. Economists’ views on this rate are necessarily estimates and\ninherently uncertain. However, while theoretical, estimates of the neutral rate are critical to assessing and making decisions regarding the stance of monetary\npolicy.\nMy own view, informed by the work of my colleagues Evan Koenig at the Dallas Fed [7] as well as John Williams of the New York Fed and Thomas Laubach\nat the Federal Reserve Board, [8] is that the longer-run neutral real rate of interest is in a broad range around 0.50 to 0.75 percent, or a nominal rate of\nroughly 2.50 to 2.75 percent.\nWith the current fed funds rate at 1.75 to 2 percent, it would take approximately three or four more federal funds rate increases of a quarter of a percent to\nget into the range of this estimated neutral level.\nAt this stage, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually raising the fed funds rate until we reach this neutral level. At that point, I would be inclined to\nstep back and assess the outlook for the economy and look at a range of other factors—including the levels and shape of the Treasury yield curve—before\ndeciding what further actions, if any, might be appropriate.\n\nBeyond 2018\nDallas Fed economists have consistently forecast that 2018 will be a strong year for economic growth in the U.S. Reasons include a strong consumer sector,\nimproved prospects for business investment due to tax incentives, solid global growth and substantial fiscal stimulus due to recent tax legislation and budget\nagreements.\nMy economic team has consistently cautioned that while 2018 will be strong, economic growth is likely to moderate in 2019 and 2020 as the impact of fiscal\nstimulus wanes and monetary policy approaches a more neutral stance. Their view has been that potential GDP growth in the U.S. is in the range of 1.75 to 2\npercent and actual real GDP growth will likely reach this level by 2020 or 2021.\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that potential GDP growth is likely to be more muted than we have historically experienced due to the impact of\nfour key structural drivers:\n1. Demographics\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years in 2000 to 38.0 in 2017.[9] The share of population 65 years or\nolder has risen to 16.1 percent from 12.8 percent 10 years ago. Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging population—leading to declines in labor force\ngrowth rates and contributing to slowing population growth in the U.S.\n\n\fGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor productivity. If workforce growth is slowing—unless we can make up\nfor it through improvements in labor productivity—we will see lower rates of potential GDP growth. This slower potential GDP growth is crucial because it has\nsignificant implications for future living standards in the U.S. Because the projected path of government debt to GDP is historically elevated, higher rates of\ngrowth will be needed to service and pay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\nFurthermore, the labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe the\nbulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. In fact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation rate should decline to 61\npercent over the next 10 years.[10] A declining fraction of the population participating in the workforce should lead to lower output growth.\n2. Lagging Education and Skill Levels\nIt is my view that lagging education and skill levels in the U.S. are likely having a negative impact on productivity growth despite substantial innovations in\ntechnology and increased business investment.\nWhile we have witnessed very rapid technological change and improvements, productivity growth has remained sluggish. Output per worker grew on\naverage by approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.4 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010. Our\nhypothesis at the Dallas Fed is that advancements in technology are having a profound impact on the workforce. This, in turn, is putting a premium on\neducation and skill levels in order to improve workforce adaptability. A case in point is the changing nature of middle-skills jobs.\nIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or have a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding\nthat your job is being either restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong job market, but unless they\nhave gotten retrained, they are likely to see constraints on growth in their income and productivity. This may be one reason we haven’t seen a bigger\nproductivity-growth payoff from recent advances in technology. Productivity growth that has occurred does not appear to have benefited all workers; those\nworkers with less education may be finding their real wages and productivity declining in a new age where skills training and educational achievement levels\nare increasingly critical to adapting to the job market.\nIt is important to recognize that various research studies highlight that skill levels and educational achievement levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged\nthose of other developed countries for the past several years. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[11] In addition, according to recent OECD surveys, the U.S. ranked\n24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[12]\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and\nscience skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth.[13] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have\nsubstantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that in order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must do more to improve early childhood literacy and college\nreadiness and beef up skills training at our high schools and community colleges. These efforts are a powerful investment in improving the quality of our\nhuman capital, which is essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n3. The Potentially Unsustainable Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\nPotentially unsustainable government debt growth in the U.S. is creating a fiscal tailwind in 2018 and 2019 but may turn into a headwind if the U.S. takes\nsteps to moderate its historically high expected path of debt growth. Despite the fact that the current economic expansion is the second longest in the\npostwar period, U.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75.8 percent of GDP,[14] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated\n\n\fat approximately $54 trillion.[15] The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues. As a\nconsequence of this level of debt, the U.S. is much less likely to have the fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\nFurther, high and rising levels of government debt as well as elevated levels of corporate debt mean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest\nrate sensitive. That is, increases in interest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate and government debt\nobligations. Structural reforms and other actions that flatten the path of future government debt growth may be advisable to keep this short-term-growth\ntailwind from becoming a medium- and longer-term headwind to economic growth in the U.S.\n4. Globalization\nFailing to take advantage of the opportunities of globalization is likely to lower U.S. GDP relative to potential. With less than 5 percent of the world’s\npopulation,[16] the U.S. faces growth capacity constraints and has developed integrated supply chains and logistics arrangements in this hemisphere which\nhave helped improve U.S. competitiveness. Dallas Fed economists believe it makes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those which are\nprimarily final goods versus intermediate goods. For example, our trade deficit with China is primarily final goods. Conversely, our trading relationships with\nMexico and Canada are primarily intermediate goods. As mentioned earlier, intermediate-goods trading relationships are more indicative of integrated supply\nchain and logistics arrangements which have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global competitiveness.\nIn addition, the U.S. has historically added to its workforce growth through immigration. Immigrants and their children have made up over half the workforce\ngrowth in the U.S. over the past two decades,[17] and this proportion is likely to be even higher over the next two decades, as shown in Chart 2.\n\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which has benefits for economic growth.[18] Our research also\nindicates that high-skilled immigration has been shown to positively influence productivity growth. Nearly half of college-educated immigrants majored in\nscience, technology, engineering or math (STEM). This far outpaces U.S.-born college-educated workers, about one quarter of whom major in STEM fields.\nHigh-skilled foreign-born workers have also been shown to patent at higher rates than native workers, largely as a result of their concentration in the STEM\nfields.[19] This type of innovative activity has been shown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity growth in the post-World War II period.[20]\nHow the U.S. navigates these globalization challenges will have critical impacts on potential GDP growth.\n\nWhere We Go from Here\nWhen I joined the Fed in September of 2015, the federal funds rate was 0.0 to 0.25 percent. This rate had not been adjusted since late 2008. The Fed’s\nbalance sheet stood at approximately $4.5 trillion.\nSince that time, the Fed has been able to gradually remove accommodation and implement a plan to reduce the size of its balance sheet. Over this period,\nthe unemployment rate has moved down substantially and inflation is now running at approximately 2 percent.\nAt this juncture, the challenge for the Fed is to raise the federal funds rate in a gradual manner calibrated to extend this expansion, but not so gradually as to\nget behind the curve so that we have to play catch-up and raise rates quickly. Having to raise rates quickly would likely increase the risk of recession.\nAs I judge the pace at which we should be raising the federal funds rate, I will be carefully watching the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Currently the one-year\nTreasury rate is 2.44 percent, the two-year is 2.61 percent and the 10-year is 2.87 percent.[21] My own view is that the short end of the Treasury curve is\nresponding to Federal Reserve policy expectations. The longer end of the curve is telling me that, while there is substantial global liquidity and a search for\nsafe assets, expectations for future growth are sluggish—and this is consistent with an expectation that U.S. growth will trend back down to potential. Overall,\n\n\fthe shape of the curve suggests to me we are “late” in the economic cycle. I do not discount the significance of an inverted yield curve—I believe it is worth\npaying attention to given the high historical correlation between inversions and recession.\nI will also be closely monitoring global financial and economic developments and their potential impact on domestic financial and economic conditions. As\nglobal financial markets and economies have become increasingly interconnected, the potential for spillovers to the U.S. is greater than in the past. That is,\nglobal economic and financial instability has the potential to transmit to domestic financial markets, potentially leading to a tightening of financial conditions\nwhich, if prolonged, could lead to a slowing in U.S. economic activity.\nBased on these various factors, as well as the current strength of the U.S. economy and my outlook for economic conditions over the medium term, I believe\nit will be appropriate for the Fed to continue to gradually move toward a neutral monetary policy stance. I believe that this gradual approach to removing\nmonetary policy accommodation will give us the best chance of managing against imbalances and further extending the current economic expansion in the\nU.S.\n\nNotes\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.

            "content": "A Perspective on Oil\nJune 19, 2018\n\nU.S. crude oil production is estimated to have grown from 5.1 million barrels per day in May 2008 to approximately 10.6 million barrels per day in May 2018.\n[1], [2] As a result of this growth, the U.S. now represents approximately 13 percent of global crude oil production, up from 7 percent 10 years ago.\nImprovements in shale oil drilling and completion techniques have been a critical element of this growth, with much of the new production occurring in Texas\nas well as North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Colorado.[3] While the U.S. continues to be a substantial crude oil importer, the shale boom has\nallowed our country to substantially reduce the percentage of petroleum product consumption that is supplied by imports.\nDallas Fed economists focus on energy market dynamics because of their implications for oil prices, which in turn, affect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP),\nemployment and inflation. As we’ve seen in past economic cycles, changes in oil prices particularly impact consumer spending and input costs for\nbusinesses, as well as capital investment and job creation in energy-producing regions of the U.S.\nGiven the importance of oil to the U.S. and global economies, the Dallas Fed has assembled an experienced team of energy economists, created key\nindustry surveys and built relationships with industry executives in order to build a deep understanding of the energy industry and global energy markets. In\nthe fall of 2017, we created an Energy Advisory Council to more systematically build our insights into energy market trends and developments. Through\nthese various channels, we seek to gain insights that are critical to our understanding of the impact of energy market developments on economic conditions\nand their implications for monetary policy in the U.S.\nWhile this essay focuses primarily on oil, Dallas Fed economists also focus on understanding renewable energy sources. As discussed in recent Dallas Fed\npublications, Wind Power a Growing Force in Oil Countryand Texas Has ‘All-of-the-Above’ Energy Approach, Texas is the nation’s largest producer of windgenerated electricity.[4] In the years ahead, we expect renewables such as wind and solar power to comprise a larger percentage of the nation’s energy mix.\nHowever, even with substantial growth in renewables, it is expected that fossil fuels will comprise approximately 77 percent of global energy use in 2040 (as\nestimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration).[5]\n\nBackground\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in relative balance. First quarter 2018 estimates indicate that global average oil\nproduction was approximately 98.3 million barrels per day and global consumption was approximately 98.4 million barrels per day.[6] These estimates\nincorporate the December 2016 agreement made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries to cut\ncrude oil production by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day.\nRecently, OPEC and other oil-producing countries have discussed restoring some of this crude oil production cut. In the short run, such a restoration of\nproduction might help offset expected production outages from countries such as Venezuela and Iran. However, in the medium term, Dallas Fed economists\ncontinue to believe that, due to expected growth in daily global demand, the trend of global supply/demand is fundamentally toward balance.\nOil supply is substantially comprised of three main segments: crude oil, natural gas liquids and biofuels.[7] It is our view, based on Dallas Fed analysis,\nsurveys and discussions with industry contacts, that U.S. crude oil production will grow by more than 1 million barrels per day in 2018 and exceed\napproximately 11.2 million barrels per day by year-end. In addition, we expect U.S. production of natural gas liquids of approximately 4.5 million barrels per\nday and production of biofuels of approximately 1.2 million barrels per day by year-end 2018.[8]\nIn terms of crude oil production, only Russia, which currently accounts for approximately 11 million barrels per day, produces more than the U.S.[9] By\ncomparison, Saudi Arabia currently produces approximately 10 million barrels of crude oil per day, having cut approximately 0.5 million barrels per day from\nits crude oil production as a result of the OPEC agreement.\nDallas Fed economists estimate that by year-end 2018, the U.S. will consume approximately 20.6 million barrels per day of oil. Our economists believe that,\nover the next several years, the U.S. will continue to increase its oil production, while consumption growth is expected to flatten due to energy efficiency\ngains as well as greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources to meet energy demand.\nGlobal oil markets face a number of uncertainties and challenges. How these issues unfold will likely have implications for energy prices as well as economic\nconditions and monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nKey Issues and Challenges\nReduction in Spending on Long-Lived Projects\nOne potential issue facing the global oil market is the recent decline in capital investment in long-lived exploration and production (E&P) projects. Historically,\nmajor oil companies have allocated substantial portions of their capital expenditure budgets to these long-lived investments. These investments have\nincluded deepwater and ultra-deepwater offshore wells,[10] Arctic drilling and oil sands production. These projects typically cost hundreds of millions to\nbillions of dollars to complete, take several years to build and have useful lives in excess of 20 years. These projects are important to global energy markets\nbecause they fundamentally increase medium- and longer-term global oil supply.\n\n\fAs Chart 1 indicates, since 2014, major oil companies have reduced their capital expenditures relating to long-lived projects. As a consequence of several\nyears of lower investment spending on these projects, the global energy market has increased its dependence on future production growth from shale oil.\n\nShale production has the benefit of being more financially manageable and operationally nimble. However, shale wells typically have very rapid production\ndecline characteristics (discussed below). Specifically, a shale project is a much more “short-cycle” investment than a typical conventional project—it can be\ndrilled and brought onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8 million per well. However, because of its rapid production\ndecline features, shale requires additional and continuous investment in order to maintain production levels.\nChart 2 shows the growth in shale crude oil output in the U.S. Less than 10 years ago, U.S. shale produced approximately 0.5 million barrels per day, or less\nthan 1 percent of global crude oil production.[11] In 2017, U.S. shale produced approximately 4.7 million barrels per day and made up approximately 6\npercent of global crude oil production. As shale makes up an increasing percentage of global crude oil supply, the challenge will be to find ways to increase\nshale well productivity, overcome input shortages and ramp up production to meet incremental global demand growth.\n\nGrowth in Global Demand\nDemand for oil grew from an average of 90.4 million barrels per day in 2012 to approximately 98.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018.[12]\n\n\fMuch of this growth has come from emerging-market economies, particularly China, India and countries in the Middle East region (see Chart 3 for analysis of\nglobal demand growth).\n\nIt is estimated that global oil demand is likely to increase from an average of 98.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018 to approximately 101.5\nmillion barrels per day by 2020. World Bank and International Monetary Fund projections suggest that global demand growth will continue to be driven\nprimarily by emerging-market economies.\nThis forecast rate of global demand growth (approximately 1.1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day) should provide a strong underpinning for global energy\nmarkets and the resulting price of oil. The challenge will be producing enough oil to meet demand growth over the next three to five years.[13]\nImpediments to Growth of U.S. Shale Oil Production\nWhile estimates for growth of U.S. shale vary among industry observers, our contacts believe that U.S. shale production should be sufficient to supply a\nsubstantial portion of incremental global demand growth for the next few years. However, our industry contacts are concerned about key production\nimpediments that have the potential to limit the ability of shale to supply incremental global demand growth beyond that time frame.\nWhile there are a number of shale formations across the U.S., the most prolific is the Permian Basin, a geologic area rich in oil and gas that is 250 miles wide\nand 300 miles long across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. The Permian was responsible for approximately 63 percent of U.S. crude oil production\ngrowth in 2017, far outpacing the next-most-prolific U.S. shale formation, the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana (which accounted for approximately 18\npercent of U.S. crude oil production growth).[14]\nIndustry contacts cite the Permian’s advantage over other areas due to its multiple layers of thick shale rock, the quality of the oil and the relatively close\nproximity to refiners, export terminals and pipelines. The March 2018 Dallas Fed Energy Survey indicated that the Midland Basin portion of the Permian\nappears to be more economically attractive than other shale formations, on average, as shown in Chart 4. However, several of our industry contacts suggest\nthat the Delaware Basin has attractive drilling characteristics that are as compelling as the Midland Basin’s.\nAs West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices have remained above $60 for most of 2018, drilling outside the most attractive portions of the Permian has\nbecome more economically appealing for E&P companies. These areas include the Bakken, parts of the Eagle Ford in South Texas and most of the\nSCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma. If prices persist at current levels, industry contacts expect to see oil companies more aggressively expand their production\nactivities beyond the Permian Basin.\n\n\fAs mentioned above, our Dallas Fed industry contacts believe that there are a number of challenges to continued robust growth in shale crude oil production\nin the medium term. The most significant potential challenges are described below.\n1. Rapid production decline curve of shale.\nThe primary method for drilling wells in shale-rock formations is known as horizontal drilling—where a well is drilled vertically (averaging approximately\n10,000 feet) before being guided horizontally through the rock (averaging a distance of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet). Although a highly effective method,\nhorizontal wells often reach peak crude oil production in the first few months, with output declining rapidly thereafter, sometimes as much as 80 percent after\none year. As a result, in order to grow overall crude oil production, more wells must be drilled and well productivity must be boosted substantially. While\ncompanies are drilling more wells this year to overcome this decline curve, they face constraints regarding labor, input costs, infrastructure and the return\nrequirements of capital providers.\n2. Shortages of labor.\nDallas Fed industry contacts report that the oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin faces a shortage of workers. Our contacts note that industry service\ncompanies are facing higher levels of turnover as workers either leave for higher pay at competitors or leave the industry due to the highly strenuous working\nconditions. In addition, companies report finding it difficult to attract previously laid-off workers back to the industry. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate\nthat layoffs during the oil price decline of 2014–15 resulted in an estimated loss of one-third of the workforce,[15] and industry contacts report that many\nworkers either are reluctant to return to the industry or need significant financial and/or job security incentives to return given the boom/bust nature of the\nindustry.\nWhile the oil and gas industry has become more efficient, drilling and completing wells is still a labor-intensive endeavor. The oil production sector has added\nmore than 40,000 jobs in Texas and more than 60,000 jobs in the U.S. from December 2016 through April 2018, and high demand for workers has led to\nsignificant wage pressures. Our Dallas Fed Energy Survey shows that energy companies based in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District (which includes\nTexas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico) increased wages and benefits throughout 2017 and have been accelerating this pace in 2018.\nLabor shortages are particularly acute in the Permian Basin. The May 2018 unemployment rate in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian, was 2.2 percent.\n[16] Housing is also in short supply in the Permian Basin, and companies have again resorted to using temporary housing structures for their workers. House\nprices in Midland have risen substantially since 2016, and housing inventories are estimated at one month of supply.[17]\n3. Raw material, environmental and infrastructure challenges.\nWater and sand are key inputs used in shale production, accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the cost of drilling and completing a well.[18] Contacts report that\nsand costs have increased substantially during the past 12 months. Specifically, increasing volumes of sand used in well fracking are creating strains on\ninfrastructure in the region (10,000 tons of sand per well is not uncommon, requiring 100 railcars or 400 truckloads for transport).\nIn addition, water availability has become more of a logistical and financial challenge. As operators pursue larger well-completion projects and often operate\non multiple well pads, the need for more advanced planning to arrange for water-supply logistics is becoming a more significant challenge. Another concern\nis water disposal. While companies often source water used in fracking from an underground aquifer in the Permian, operators cite greater concerns\nregarding the disposal of wastewater that is produced as a byproduct of oil. On average, three to five barrels of water come out of the ground for every barrel\nof oil that is produced.[19] This water must either be transported to an approved saltwater disposal well, further straining transportation infrastructure, or\nrecycled and used as frack water—a process that is generally considered too expensive for most operators.\n\n\fSeveral industry contacts and other observers have cited their concerns regarding water and air pollution, wastewater management and other issues relating\nto emissions of greenhouse gases. These are critical issues which state as well as federal regulatory agencies must actively monitor and are important\noperating considerations for firms participating in this industry. Several of our contacts, and industry observers, have discussed the critical need for proper\nsafeguards in order to prevent degradation of water and air quality, and loss of land use.\nIn the Permian, oil and natural gas pipeline capacity—used to transport oil and natural gas to refineries and processing plants hundreds of miles from the well\nsite—remains a potential problem in 2018 and 2019. Our expectation is that oil pipeline capacity will become very tight late in 2018 and early 2019, as shown\nin Chart 5, and possibly sooner if production surprises to the upside or pipelines and refineries experience unforeseen downtime. However, the pipeline\nbottlenecks should be alleviated in the second half of 2019 as new pipelines come onstream.\n\n4. Capital discipline exerted by equity owners.\nEnergy executives report that public-market capital providers are much more focused on capital discipline from oil and gas companies. From January 2,\n2017, through June 13, 2018, energy stocks increased only 1.1 percent, while the price of oil and the S&P 500 increased 35.8 percent and 24.2 percent,\nrespectively, as shown in Chart 6.[20]\nAs a result of this underperformance, industry contacts report that capital providers are increasingly pressuring management teams to increase their focus on\nachieving higher rates of return, rather than focusing primarily on increasing overall production levels. Contacts report that this capital-discipline focus is\ncausing many boards of directors to revise incentive structures and compensation arrangements for company management teams. It may also have the\nimpact of encouraging some independent production companies to more proactively consider mergers and other actions that increase scale and improve\noperating margins.\n\n\fProduction Outages and Geopolitical Risks\nA large percentage of global oil production is in politically unstable areas of the world, and political and military conflict as well as governance challenges\nhave given rise to oil supply disruptions in the past several years. These disruptions (or “supply shocks”) have the potential to cause a rise in oil prices in the\nshort term.\nSome of the more significant disruptions in recent years have occurred in Venezuela, Libya and Iran. Daily Venezuelan crude oil production is estimated to\nhave fallen by 1.1 million barrels since 2013 and is continuing to decline.[21] Libya has experienced civil strife since the fall of Gaddafi. After declining from a\nhigh of 1.6 million barrels per day in January 2011 to zero in August 2011, Libyan crude oil production moved back up to roughly 1.0 million barrels per day in\nMay 2018. Iran has seen its crude oil production increase by approximately 0.8 million barrels per day following the removal of sanctions in 2016. However,\nthe recent U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement has the potential to reduce Iranian exports and crude oil production.\nIn a global market that is in relative oil supply/demand balance, supply outages due to geopolitical events have the potential to cause sporadic episodes of\nspikes in oil prices.\n\nImplications for Energy Markets\nDallas Fed economists and our industry contacts increasingly are of the view that we have gone from a global oversupply situation (2014 to mid-2017) to one\ncurrently of relative balance (taking into account OPEC supply restrictions). Over the next few years, we believe that global oil markets will be in a “fragile\nequilibrium” in which demand growth should likely be met in large part by growth in U.S. shale oil production. ‎This, of course, assumes no new material\ndisruptions from major oil-producing countries in the Middle East or other producers such as Russia, Nigeria or Venezuela.\nHowever, given the current lack of investment in long-lived production projects, and assuming global oil demand continues to grow between 1.1 million and\n1.5 million barrels per day,[22] we would expect future world consumption growth to be more dependent on shale production growth. Due to the potential\nimpediments described above, there is a growing likelihood of an eventual global undersupply situation in which shale will be unable to keep up with demand\ngrowth. Industry contacts acknowledge that higher oil prices could well induce producers to find ways to overcome these potential impediments.\nIn particular, some industry participants are hopeful that this situation could be mitigated by continued technological innovation in shale production and\nincreases in OPEC production, as well as greater future investment in long-lived projects such as oil sands production in Canada and offshore drilling. In\ngeneral, industry contacts emphasize that higher oil prices certainly have the potential to make these mitigants more likely to occur.\nOverall, given our forecast and the potential impediments to substantial growth in shale oil production, we believe global oil markets are likely to be more\nvulnerable in the medium term to geopolitical shocks and disruptions that would create a potential for price risk to the upside.\nA More Muted Impact of Higher Oil Prices on the U.S. Economy\nIncreases in oil prices can be caused by higher-than-expected demand (so-called “demand shocks”) from a stronger global economy or from unexpected\nreductions in supply (so-called “supply shocks”), such as those resulting from certain types of geopolitical events. Today, Dallas Fed economists believe that\nthe recent run-up in oil prices is due to a combination of both demand and supply factors.\nHistorically, recessions in the U.S. have often followed oil price shocks. Higher oil prices tend to increase costs to consumers, which can, in turn, reduce their\ndisposable income and consumption of non-oil goods and services. For example, Dallas Fed analysis indicates that every dollar increase in the oil price\nleads to a 2.4 cent increase in gasoline prices—all other factors staying the same—which over the course of a year would amount to approximately $3.4\nbillion in additional expenditures on gasoline.[23] Oil price increases also tend to cause firms to experience higher energy, shipping and input costs.\n\n\fOver time, several factors have mitigated the impact of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy. The emergence of U.S. shale is one factor, as increased\ndomestic production means that a larger share of the economy is helped by higher oil prices. Reduced crude oil imports also benefit our trade balance.\nFinally, as shown in Chart 7, the U.S. economy is less oil-intensive than in the past due to substitution for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel\nefficiency and growth in the less-energy-intensive services sector as a share of the overall economy. For example, in 1970, the U.S. consumed 1.1 barrels of\noil for every $1,000 of GDP; by 2017, only 0.4 barrels of oil were consumed for every $1,000 of GDP.[24]\nBased on these various factors, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that the negative impact of higher oil prices on GDP growth is likely to be more muted\nthan in the past. It is our view that a 10 percent increase in the oil price should have a relatively modest negative impact on U.S. GDP growth.[25] This\nnegative impact should further diminish as the U.S. continues to grow its domestic oil production.\n\nUnderstanding Evolving Oil Market Dynamics\nThe purpose of this essay has been to lay out the key factors the Dallas Fed closely tracks in analyzing the global energy markets and in considering the\nimpact of oil prices on economic conditions in the U.S. Like any dynamic market, the oil market can be unpredictable, and key elements are often shifting,\nwhich can have profound impacts on global supply and demand. Given the importance of oil to the U.S. and global economies, our Dallas Fed research team\nis highly focused on understanding these market dynamics and determining their implications for GDP, unemployment and inflation in the U.S.\nAs discussed in this essay, Dallas Fed economists believe that the global oil market is now in relative supply/demand balance. Based on various factors\ndiscussed, it is our judgment that this market is likely in the years ahead to be more vulnerable to geopolitical events and other dynamics that could create\nprice risks to the upside. As these dynamics unfold, we will continue to work with our industry contacts to better understand the oil market and its implications\nfor monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nNotes\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Soojin Jo, Evan Koenig, Marc Giannoni, Kunal Patel, Michael Plante, William\nSimmons, Martin Stuermer, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks.

Shale\noil is a relatively light oil and does not yield as much middle distillate as heavier oils (from, for example, Middle East or Venezuela crude oils) in\nthe refining process. As a result, refiners may have difficulty supplying sufficient quantities of middle distillates in the near term.\n14. As of May 2018. See note 3.\n15.

            "content": "Taking the Long View: Creating a Better Future for Our Children and Grandchildren\nApril 16, 2018\n\nTurn on the television or pick up a newspaper and you’ll likely see a discussion of what’s happening now—the latest scandal, current geopolitical\ndevelopments, stock market movements, the latest GDP numbers or corporate earnings announcements. This focus on the here and now is so ingrained that\nwe may not be aware of the short-term nature of the news flow. In the midst of this, it is sometimes easy to lose focus on the fact that short-term events often\noccur as a result of more persistent underlying forces that can take many years to unfold.\nWhat does all this have to do with the work of a central banker? I spend a good part of my time trying to understand economic conditions and make sound\nmonetary policy decisions based on my analysis of those conditions. In this job, I am keenly aware that short-term cyclical developments are only part of the\nstory in understanding the U.S. and global economies.\n\nThe Cyclical Versus the Secular\nThe U.S. economy has historically moved in cycles. That is, it typically behaves in patterns that tend to be, with variations, repeating. There are stretches of\ntime when GDP grows, and these tend to be followed by periods of GDP decline, followed eventually by a return to growth, followed again by a period of\ndecline, and so on. These cycles often repeat themselves although the exact length, magnitude and character of the pattern varies based on a variety of\nunderlying factors.\nEconomists use models and other analytical techniques to assess and attempt to forecast the performance of the economy in these cycles. Based on these\nmodels, economists look for markers and other data that indicate where we are in the cycle as well as the strength and character of the economy’s\nperformance. GDP, unemployment, various gauges of manufacturing and service sector activity, and inflation measures are examples of economic indicators\nthat are regularly monitored. These measures are widely reported and tend to fluctuate based on factors such as industry developments, commodity prices,\nmarket developments, global developments as well as monetary and fiscal policies, and the stage of the current economic cycle.\nIn contrast to cyclical events, longer-term secular trends are usually not discussed on the evening news. They are much slower moving underlying trends that\nusually develop over an extended period of time. They may not be visible or widely reported and can take years to unfold. Examples could include\ndemographic and migration trends, changes in consumer and industry behaviors due to automation and labor-saving technologies, and elements of global\neconomic integration and development.\nIn my experience, while cyclical fluctuations often attract our attention, the underlying secular trends usually help explain these shorter-term developments.\nUnderlying structural forces may not capture the headlines because they are slower moving and may not have a material impact for several years. However,\nthese forces are ultimately enormously powerful.\nThe purpose of this essay is to first discuss the shorter-term cyclical aspects of the U.S. economy and then focus on the longer-term structural trends. In my\njudgment, it is critical that we more fully understand and address these secular trends if we are to have a more prosperous economic future.\n\nThe Near Term\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2018. This growth is underpinned by a strong household sector, improved business\ninvestment and stronger growth outlook outside the U.S.\nBased on this forecast, Dallas Fed economists expect unemployment to dip from 4.1 percent to approximately 3.7 percent during the year. We also expect\nother measures of labor force slack to tighten. In particular, we focus on U-6, which comprises the unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” (workers\nwho indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one), plus people who are working part time who would prefer to work full time. This\nmeasure now stands at 8.0 percent, near its prerecession low, and we expect it to improve further during 2018. We also consider estimates of the numbers of\ndisabled workers, previously incarcerated individuals as well as other sources of available workers who could potentially return to the workforce in a\nstrengthening job market.\nBased on their analysis of the labor market, our economists continue to believe that, while improvements can be made in increasing employment, we are\nlikely at or already past “full employment” in the U.S. Dallas Fed surveys suggest that businesses are increasingly struggling to find workers to fill low- and\nmiddle-skills positions. For example, in one of our recent surveys, 61 percent of Texas small-business respondents suggested they are unable to find workers\nto fill these types of positions.[1] Due to this labor force tightness, it is our view that cyclical wage pressures should build during 2018.\nRegarding inflation, we believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are building. However, our economists also believe that these forces are being at least\npartially offset by the impacts of automation and, to a lesser extent, globalization. Discussions with our business contacts continue to indicate that, due to the\nimpact of automation and business model disruption, pricing power of businesses is more limited than we’re historically accustomed to seeing at this stage in\nan economic expansion.\nWhile we expect GDP growth to be strong in 2018, we also expect that this growth will moderate in 2019 and 2020. In fact, Dallas Fed economists are\nforecasting GDP growth of less than 2 percent in 2020 as the short-term stimulus of the recent tax legislation and budget agreement begin to fade and\nmonetary policy and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n\n\fLonger-Term Structural Trends\nWhile the near-term cyclical outlook is solid, underlying structural trends are more concerning. I make a point of discussing secular trends in every speech\nbecause, as policymakers, if we focus on them, we can impact how they will unfold over the medium and longer term. If we pay insufficient attention to these\nissues, we may find that they ultimately overwhelm shorter-term cyclical factors and lead to less growth and prosperity in the U.S. economy. I will discuss four\noverarching secular trends.\n\nDemographics\nThe U.S. population is aging. In fact, the median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years in 2000 to 37.9 in 2016.[2] The share of population 65 years\nor older has risen to 15.7 percent from 12.6 percent 10 years ago.[3] Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging demographics—leading to declines in labor\nforce and population growth in the U.S.\n\nGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor productivity. If workforce growth is slowing, unless we can make up\nfor it through more rapid improvement in labor productivity, we will see lower rates of GDP growth. This slower GDP growth is crucial because it has\nsignificant implications for future living standards in the U.S. Because government debt to GDP is historically elevated, growth will be needed to service and\npay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\nThe labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe the bulk of this\ndecline is due to aging of the workforce. In fact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation rate should decline to 61 percent over\nthe next 10 years.[4]\nThis demographic challenge is occurring, to varying degrees, across most advanced economies. For example, Germany and Japan have more challenging\ndemographic trends than the U.S.[5]\nWhat can we do about this demographic challenge? First, we could implement programs and policies that encourage higher birth rates among our\npopulation. This could help address workforce growth 25 years from now. We can adopt policies that encourage people not in the workforce to join the\nworkforce; these policies could include improved child care, better transportation services for at-risk populations, and incentives for discouraged workers to\nrejoin the workforce. Another supplement to workforce growth is immigration. Immigrants and their children have made up over half the workforce growth in\nthe U.S. over the past 20 years, and this proportion is likely to be even higher over the next 20 years. (See Appendix for a further discussion of the role of\nimmigration in the economy.)\n\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications for Educational Achievement and the Skills Gap\nWorkers are increasingly being replaced by automation. Consumers are increasingly able to use technology to shop for goods and services. Business\nmodels are being disrupted by new approaches to delivering goods and services at lower prices and potentially better convenience. As a result, business\npricing power is increasingly being challenged. In response, businesses are investing more in technology and merging with other companies to achieve\ngreater scale in order to protect gross profit margins. These trends appear to be accelerating globally.[6]\nDespite rapid technological change, productivity growth has remained sluggish. Output per worker grew on average by approximately 1.9 percent per year in\nthe 1990s, slowed to 1.3 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010. One explanation may be that technology is having a\nprofound impact on the workforce. In particular, it is changing the nature of middle-skills jobs.\n\n\fIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or have a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding\nthat your job is being either restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong job market, but unless they\nhave gotten retrained, they are likely to see their incomes and productivity decline. This may be one reason that we haven’t seen a bigger productivity-growth\npayoff from recent advances in technology. We measure productivity growth workforce-wide rather than by company or industry. While most industries are\nmaterially improving their productivity, workers with less education may be finding their real wages and productivity declining in a new age where skills\ntraining and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the job market.\nRegarding education, the U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately, several studies suggest that the skill levels and\neducational achievement levels of our workforce have lagged other developed countries for the last several years. In surveys of 29 participating Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[7] In addition,\naccording to recent OECD surveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.\n[8]\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and\nscience skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth.[9] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have\nsubstantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nIn order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must do more to improve early childhood literacy and college readiness, and do more to\nstrengthen skills training at our high schools and community colleges.\n\nThe Potentially Unsustainable Path of Government Debt to GDP\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75 percent of GDP,[10] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately\n$49 trillion.[11] The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues. While increasing the level of\ndebt to GDP is a stimulus to economic growth in the short run, that stimulus can turn into a growth headwind when the government takes steps to moderate\ndebt growth, as it certainly must consider doing in the years ahead. As a consequence of this level of debt, the U.S. is much less likely to have fiscal capacity\nto fight the next recession.\nFurther, due to this level of government debt as well as historically high levels of corporate debt as a percentage of GDP, the economy is becoming much\nmore interest rate sensitive. That is, increases in interest rates have greater potential to require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate\nand government debt obligations. Structural reforms and other actions that flatten the path of future government debt growth may be advisable at this stage\nof the economic cycle.\n\nGlobalization\nWorld economies and financial markets are increasingly integrated and interconnected. This trend is not new, but it certainly has been intensifying over the\npast many years. Companies increasingly think about their labor force and capital investment decisions in a global manner. Investors increasingly think\nglobally about where to allocate capital. This helps explain why lower labor costs in one country can have an impact on inflation and labor market\ndevelopments in other countries and it also helps explain why interest rate levels, stock market valuations and occasional market turmoil in one country can\nripple through currencies and global markets very rapidly.\nTrade is certainly part of this globalization trend. With the World Trade Organization, North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements,\nglobal trade has increased. In many cases, this increase in trade, along with technological advances, has been good for the U.S. in terms of consumer\nbenefits and improving corporate efficiency and profits, but, at the same time, it has led to painful job disruption and dislocations in many cities and towns in\nour nation.\nToday, a new trend has emerged which is likely surpassing globalization in terms of job disruption—technology-enabled disruption (described above). That is,\nif your job is being disrupted today, it is far more likely due to technology-enabled disruption rather than globalization.\nDallas Fed economists believe it makes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those which are primarily final goods versus intermediate goods.\nFor example, our trade deficit with China is primarily final goods. Conversely, our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada are primarily intermediate\ngoods. Intermediate goods trading relationships are more indicative of integrated supply chain and logistics arrangements. Dallas Fed research indicates that\nintermediate goods relationships have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global competitiveness.\nIn this regard, Dallas Fed economists believe that, at this stage in our history, globalization is more likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow as opposed to a\n“threat.” With less than 5 percent of the world’s population, we believe that trade is critical to future growth in the U.S. Emerging markets and other growing\neconomies are increasingly important sources of demand for U.S. goods and services.\nIt is critical that we accurately diagnose globalization and untangle it from the impacts of technology-enabled disruption. Dallas Fed economists believe that\nupdating and modernizing trade agreements is highly appropriate, but our research also indicates that trade is a critical opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster\nand improve the future prosperity of our nation.\n\nImplications\nPopular press and current national discussions tend to focus heavily on shorter-term cyclical developments. Because the near-term outlook for GDP growth\nis positive, this may lull observers into believing we are on a path to sustained improvement in the economic performance of the U.S. economy. This belief\nmay well distract policymakers and the public from focusing on the powerful structural trends that are likely to create challenges for growth in the medium and\nlonger term.\nLeadership is required to take a longer-term view and take steps to create a better economic future for our children and grandchildren. The Dallas Fed\nforecasts that 2018 will be a solid year for economic growth in the U.S. However, unless our nation initiates structural reforms that improve workforce growth,\n\n\feducation and skill levels of our labor force, moderate the expected path of government debt growth, and adopts policies that allow us to capture the\nopportunities provided by globalization, we are likely to see sluggish rates of GDP growth in the medium and longer term.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nThe Impact of Immigration on U.S. Workforce and Demographic Trends\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration has been a key element of economic growth in the U.S. However, immigration is not a purely economic issue\n—which is why it is a highly sensitive and controversial subject. The purpose of this note is to discuss the economic aspects of immigration as a key element\nin growing the workforce and to explore alternative immigration policies. This discussion is particularly important today in light of the aging U.S. workforce.\nImmigrants and their children have made up more than 50 percent of working-age population growth in the U.S. over the past 20 years.[12] As shown in\nChart A-1, we expect immigrants and their children to make up an even larger share of working-age population growth over the next 20 years as the\nretirement of baby boomers leads to a net decline in the working-age population of native-born workers.\n\nThe Mix of Immigration Flows\nAlthough immigration is becoming increasingly important to workforce growth, immigration flows to the U.S. have slowed over the past 10 years. The biggest\ndeclines have been in unauthorized immigration, in part, due to housing market declines as a result of the Great Recession (which led to a decline in\nresidential construction work opportunities) as well as more stringent enforcement policies along the Southwest border and in the U.S. interior. Improved\neconomic conditions and falling population growth in Mexico have also played a role in dampening migration to the U.S.\nTemporary worker visas have recently increased, as has the flow of new legal permanent residents. Tighter labor markets are likely playing a role in boosting\nthe demand for hiring foreign-born workers, and there is some evidence that this demand can be channeled through legal means. See Chart A-2 for\nmeasures of immigration.\n\n\fThe Importance of Skilled Immigration\nImmigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which has benefits for economic growth, but high-skilled immigration has also been shown to\npositively influence productivity growth. Chart A-3 shows that nearly half of college-educated immigrants majored in science, technology, engineering or math\n(STEM). This far outpaces U.S.-born college-educated workers, about one quarter of which major in STEM fields. High-skilled foreign-born workers have\nalso been shown to patent at higher rates than native workers, largely as a result of their concentration in the STEM fields.[13] This type of innovative activity\nhas been shown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity growth in the post-World War II period.[14]\n\nImpact of Immigration on Native Workers\nDoes immigration adversely affect the working conditions of native workers? Pia Orrenius, a senior economist at the Dallas Fed, finds very little empirical\nevidence that immigrants create adverse wage effects among high-skilled workers, while wage and employment effects on low-skilled workers tend to be\nsmall.[15] Based on her research with Madeline Zavodny, she has also advocated for greater focus in the U.S. on employment- and merit-based immigration\n—which tends to bring in higher skilled workers than family-based immigration policies. They argue that demand for low-skilled immigration can be met\nthrough a temporary-worker program and that this is preferable to relying on illegal immigration, which has historically tended to be the case.[16]\n\n\fWhile immigration is a politically sensitive topic, Dallas Fed research indicates that, due to aging demographic trends, we need to come to grips with\nimmigration reform in order to supplement labor force growth in the U.S.[17] These reforms could encourage greater emphasis on employer-based and skillsbased immigration. Whatever the decisions made by policymakers, this discussion is important to creating greater GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nNotes\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, Pia Orrenius, William Simmons and Mark Wynne\nin preparing these remarks.\n1.

According to the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies’ Survey of Adult Skills (2012, 2015) by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. ranks 17th in literacy and 23rd in math out of 29 countries and 15th in problemsolving in technology-rich environments out of 26 countries.

            "content": "Discussion of Economic Conditions and Key Challenges Facing the U.S. Economy\nFebruary 21, 2018\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its January meeting decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 125 to 150 basis\npoints. In our FOMC statement after the meeting, the committee explained that it expects “economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant\nfurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate.” The purpose of this essay is to briefly discuss my views regarding economic conditions, the implications\nfor monetary policy and address a few of the fundamental challenges facing the U.S. economy. ‎\n\nEconomic Conditions\nThe Dallas Fed expects that U.S. GDP will grow at approximately 2.5 to ‎2.75 percent in 2018. We believe that consumer spending will be strong, owing to a\nhealthy jobs market and the multiyear improvement in household balance sheets. We also expect business investment to be stronger than in 2017, and we\nbelieve that improved global growth could also help support economic growth in the U.S.\nOur forecast reflects the positive near-term impact of the recent tax legislation. It is our view that the bulk of this impact will be felt in 2018 and to a lesser\nextent in 2019 and 2020.\nBased on our forecast, we expect U.S. labor market conditions to tighten this year. We forecast that headline unemployment will decline from 4.1 percent to\napproximately 3.6 percent by year end. We also expect U-6—a measure of labor slack that tracks the number of unemployed plus “marginally attached\nworkers” (workers who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one) plus those working part time for economic reasons—to decline\nfrom 8.2 percent to well below 8 percent. It is the judgment of Dallas Fed economists that current levels of headline unemployment as well as U-6 are\nindicative of an economy that is either at or has moved past the level of full employment.\nOur economists expect cyclical inflation pressures to build during 2018. While these pressures will likely be at least partially offset by the impact of\ntechnology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A), I believe the headline rate of inflation is likely to firm during the year, and we are likely to make progress\ntoward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run inflation target. I also believe we’ll see firming in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core inflation,\nwhich excludes extreme price movements (both high and low) in goods and services. This measure continues to be the Dallas Fed’s preferred gauge of\nunderlying inflation in the U.S.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nBased on these expectations, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually and patiently raising the federal funds rate during 2018. While my views on\nthe appropriate path of policy will be impacted by economic conditions as they unfold during the year, I continue to believe that gradual and patient removals\nof accommodation will increase the likelihood of extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\nHistory suggests that if the Fed waits too long to remove accommodation at this stage in the economic cycle, excesses and imbalances begin to build, and\nthe Fed ultimately has to play catch-up. In my judgment, getting behind the curve and then trying to catch up would increase the likelihood of recession in the\nU.S.\n\nChallenges Facing the U.S. Economy\nWhile Dallas Fed economists forecast strong economic growth in 2018, they also expect growth to moderate to 1.75 to 2 percent by 2020. In addition, our\nview is that “potential” GDP growth, the sustainable underlying growth capability of the U.S. economy, is approximately 1.75 percent. This level of potential\nGDP growth is lower than we’ve historically been accustomed due to several structural issues discussed below. Dallas Fed economists believe that the\ncurrent level of growth above potential is due to accommodative monetary policy as well as recent fiscal stimulus. As the impact of this stimulation wanes, we\nexpect U.S. GDP growth to trend back toward potential.\nWhy is potential GDP growth lower than we have historically been accustomed? Specifically, why are current assessments of potential GDP growth\nmaterially lower than during the 1990s and early 2000s? What has changed?\nThere are a few key structural drivers that are impacting prospects for medium-term economic growth in the U.S. How we manage and adapt to these\nstructural challenges will fundamentally impact prospects for future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nAging Demographics\nGDP growth is composed of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Due to the aging of our population, workforce growth in the U.S. is\nslowing and is likely to continue slowing. The labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas\nFed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. Unfortunately, our economists believe that these demographic trends will\ncause the labor force participation rate to decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years.\nPossible remedies to the effects of aging demographics could include incentives for workers to work later in their careers, inducing discouraged workers to\nreturn to the workforce and/or other measures that could help improve the rate of workforce growth in the U.S.\n\n\fIn addition, immigration has historically been an important element of our nation’s workforce growth. Based on published data, our Dallas Fed economists\nestimate that immigrants and their children have comprised over half of the workforce growth in the U.S. over the last 20 years and expect this group to\ncomprise an even higher percentage over the next 20 years.[1]\nOur economists have done extensive research regarding U.S. immigration as well as the immigration policies of other countries. This research indicates that\nit would be appropriate for the U.S. to consider reforms to the current immigration system to more heavily take into account immigrant skills as well as other\nemployment-based criteria. Such reforms could help enhance the economic and societal benefits from immigration.[2] Whatever policy decisions are made, it\nis clear that the resolution of current debates relating to immigration policy has the potential to either supplement or create headwinds for future workforce\ngrowth in the U.S.\nOne potential offset to these demographic trends could be improvements in labor productivity. Labor productivity is a key driver of GDP growth. However,\naverage growth in labor productivity over the past decade has been sluggish at approximately 1.1 percent per year.[3] Labor productivity growth averaged\napproximately 2 percent from 1977 through 2007. While Dallas Fed economists are hopeful that increased capital spending could help improve labor force\nproductivity, they also observe that technological progress may not contribute to productivity growth as much as it once did. One reason for this sluggishness\nmay be lagging skills and educational achievement levels of the U.S. workforce.\nThe Skills Gap and Lagging Educational Achievement Levels\nThe U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately, several studies suggest that skill levels and educational achievement levels of\nour workforce have lagged other developed countries for the last several years. According to recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) surveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[4] In\naddition, in surveys of 29 participating OECD countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[5]\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and\nscience skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth in the U.S.[6] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have\nsubstantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nIn addition, in the most recent National Federation of Independent Business small-business survey, 49 percent of respondents said they were unable to find\nqualified workers to fill open positions.[7] Similarly, respondents to Dallas Fed surveys report that they are unable to find workers with adequate technical,\norganizational and other basic skills to fill open positions.\nKansas City Fed economists estimate that approximately 43 percent of all jobs in the U.S. are so-called “middle-skills” positions.[8] These include pipe fitters,\nautomotive technicians, registered nurses, IT specialists and so on. Every one of these jobs that goes unfilled means a lost opportunity for higher GDP.\n‎These positions require more than a high school education. Due to technology-enabled disruption, the training levels for these middle-skills positions have\nintensified over the last several years. In order to train these workers, local junior colleges and high schools must work with local businesses to provide\ntraining opportunities in order to close this “skills gap.”\nThere are approximately 46 million members of the labor force in this country with a high school education or less.[9] It is our view at the Dallas Fed that, due\nto technology-enabled disruption, these workers are increasingly finding that their jobs are being restructured or eliminated. Unless they have sufficient levels\nof math and reading capability and/or are retrained, these workers are likely to struggle to adapt to the changing nature of the job market. As a result, they\nare likely to see their incomes and productivity decline.\nImproving math, reading and science capabilities, improving college readiness and beefing up the availability of skills training for potential workers will likely\nbe essential to improving our workforce productivity, reducing the number of discouraged workers and contributing to higher GDP growth in the U.S.\nThe Projected Path of U.S. Government Debt\nWhen assessing the level of debt in the economy, Dallas Fed economists look at debt held by the household sector, the business sector and the U.S.\ngovernment. Since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has substantially deleveraged. The financial health of the household sector is\ncrucial because the consumer comprises approximately 70 percent of GDP. In 2008, the household sector was historically highly leveraged relative to their\nincomes. It was not as apparent because household assets, particularly home prices, were elevated and appeared to support higher leverage. While\nconsumer leverage helped fuel GDP growth leading up to 2007, in 2008, it became apparent that the consumer had to deleverage. It has taken several years\n—along with an improving job market—for the consumer to reduce debt relative to their income. Today's healthy consumer provides a key underpinning to\nthe U.S. economy.\nUnfortunately, while the U.S. consumer has deleveraged since the Great Recession, business debt as a percentage of GDP has increased, and U.S.\ngovernment debt levels have increased substantially. While increased business debt is likely manageable, U.S. government debt held by the public is now 75\npercent of GDP,[10] and the present value of underfunded entitlements is now approximately $49 trillion.[11] There is a legitimate concern that the projected\npath of U.S. government debt relative to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable.\nThe corporate tax reform elements of recent tax legislation should help to encourage greater business formation and investment, which should lead to\ngreater productivity and some increase in the growth potential of the U.S. economy. However, the debt-financed tax cuts included in the legislation are likely\nto temporarily stimulate demand, with effects that will peak in 2018, and gradually fade in 2019 and 2020. Ultimately, we believe that growth will return back\nto trend. Dallas Fed economists believe that the expected near-term boost to GDP needs to be balanced with the concern that debt to GDP is likely to\nmaterially increase in the years ahead. This projected increase in government debt to GDP comes at a point in the economic cycle when it would be\npreferable to be moderating the rate of debt growth at the government level.\nWhile leverage can stimulate the economy as it is being added, deleveraging is likely to be depressing to GDP growth. At a minimum, higher government\nleverage will make it less likely that fiscal policy will be a realistically available tool during the next recession. ‎While addressing this issue involves difficult\npolitical considerations and policy choices, the U.S. may need to more actively consider policy actions that would moderate the path of projected U.S.\ngovernment debt growth.\n\n\fConclusion\nDallas Fed economists are optimistic about economic prospects for 2018. We expect progress this year on our dual mandate of full employment and price\nstability.\nDespite this optimism, we believe longer-term challenges remain. These challenges present opportunities for the U.S. to take action and adopt policies that\ncould improve sustainable economic growth and prosperity. Addressing these challenges is likely to require fundamental structural reforms and a broader\nmenu of policy actions beyond monetary policy.\n\nAppendix A\nA Background Note on Technology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means\nthat existing business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing goods and services.\nIn addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the\nimpact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies.\nThese trends appear to be accelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by educational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have\na college degree, the unemployment rate stands at 2.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.4 percent. If you have some college education, the\nunemployment rate is 3.4 percent and participation rate is 66.0 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent and participation rate is\n57.5 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.4 percent and participation rate is 44.8 percent.[12]\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and\nliteracy skills or are retrained, these workers may likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted\nlevels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to monetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural\nreforms. The reforms could include actions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy and improving math, reading and science\nachievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who\ngraduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.[13] As mentioned in this essay, addressing the impacts of technology-enabled\ndisruption will also require stepped up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap\n(not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational achievement levels in order to help our\ncitizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and adaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion\ndecisions as well as investing in major capital projects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital investment.\nTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve\nprofit margins. This may help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\n\nNotes\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, James Hoard, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, Alex Musatov, Pia\nOrrenius, William Simmons, Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Dianne Tunnell in preparing these remarks.\n1. “Immigration Projected to Drive Growth in U.S. Working-Age Population Through at Least 2035,” by Jeffrey S.

            "content": "A Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\n\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNovember 27, 2017\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nWilliam Simmons, Dianne Tunnell and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\n\nBackground\nThe target federal funds rate stands in a range of 100 to 125 basis points. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the federal funds rate in March as well as June of this year. I voted for\nboth of these increases. I also supported the FOMC’s decision in September to begin the process\nof gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I believe that the gradual and\nphased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the size of its Treasury and mortgagebacked securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important markets.\n\nBalancing Full Employment and Price Stability\nAs of November 2017, several key labor market indicators suggest that the U.S. economy is at or\nnear full employment. The headline unemployment rate and other measures of labor market\nutilization are now at or below pre-recession lows. In addition, Dallas Fed economists expect the\nU.S. economy to continue to grow at rates which should cause labor market conditions to tighten\nfurther. While real wage growth has been sluggish, we are beginning to see welcome signs of\nincreasing wage pressures which are consistent with removal of remaining slack from the labor\nmarket.\nInflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Moreover, the 12-month\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE, a measure of core inflation (which Dallas Fed economists believe\nprovides a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends than headline readings), started the\nyear at 1.9 percent and has drifted down to 1.6 percent in the latest reading. While some of this\nrecent decline is likely transitory, my view is that some of the more persistent weakness is due to\nstructural forces, which are limiting the pricing power of businesses and are likely having a muting\neffect on wage pressures for certain types of workers. These structural forces include technologyenabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization (see Appendix A, Technology-Enabled\nDisruption and Its Implications).\nHow should the FOMC address the current situation in which one aspect of our mandate is being\nmet while another objective is not yet being met? In this essay, I intend to address this question.\nThe Fed’s Mandate\nTo help the public understand its framework for monetary policy, the FOMC released in January\n2012, and reaffirmed in January 2017, its “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.”1 This document articulates the FOMC’s commitment to fulfilling its statutory mandate\n2\n\n\ffrom Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest\nrates.\nIn public discussions, Fed officials typically express this framework as a “dual mandate”—full\nemployment and price stability. The Fed uses a variety of economic and labor market indicators\nto judge whether the full employment objective is being met. To judge whether the price stability\nobjective is being met, the FOMC has articulated a “symmetric” inflation goal of 2 percent, as\nmeasured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\nThe term “symmetric” means that the FOMC would be equally concerned if inflation ran either\npersistently above or persistently below this 2 percent objective.\nThese dual-mandate longer-term goals are generally complementary. However, in those cases\nwhere they are not, the FOMC has said that it will seek to follow a “balanced approach” in\npromoting these goals, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially\ndifferent time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels\njudged consistent with its mandate.\n\nThe Current Situation\nAs we sit here today, the headline unemployment rate stands at approximately 4.1 percent. In\naddition, our Dallas Fed economists also look at the U-6 rate, a broader measure that includes the\npercent of unemployed, plus the number of discouraged workers, plus people working part time\nwho want to work full time. This measure of labor market utilization now stands at approximately\n7.9 percent, matching its prerecession low.\nIn addition, we also look closely at the labor force participation rate (the number of employed plus\nunemployed looking for a job as a percentage of the population 16 and older), which now stands\nat 62.7 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population and, as\nsuch, we believe that current participation levels are consistent with an economy that is at or near\nfull employment. Looking ahead, Dallas Fed economists expect this aging trend to continue in the\nU.S., as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline further to 61 percent.2 This aging trend will likely reduce the rate of labor force growth\nin the United States. Because GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in\nlabor productivity, weaker expected workforce growth is likely to negatively affect potential GDP\ngrowth in the years ahead—unless steps are taken to mitigate these effects.\nThe question arises as to the actual level of maximum sustainable employment, which can be\ndefined as the maximum level of employment that does not generate undue price pressures.\nBecause inflation pressures typically manifest themselves with a lag, this is a judgment that is\nmuch easier to make in hindsight than in real time. Having said this, Dallas Fed economists\n3\n\n\fcurrently believe that we are either at or near the level of maximum sustainable employment, and\nmay well move materially beyond maximum sustainable employment sometime in 2018.\nRegarding inflation, we have been notably running behind our 2 percent target for the past several\nyears. My own view has been that, while cyclical inflationary pressures are building, which should\nbecome more apparent over time, these pressures are being at least partially offset by the structural\nheadwinds of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A) and, to a lesser extent,\nglobalization. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that, as labor market conditions continue to\ntighten, cyclical inflationary forces should ultimately offset these structural headwinds such that\nwe will likely achieve our 2 percent target in the medium term. We are of course mindful that\nprogress in reaching our inflation mandate may well be slower and more uneven than many\nanalysts currently anticipate.\nIn summary, as a policymaker, I am balancing a labor market that is likely to become increasingly\noverheated in the months ahead with a level of inflation that is running somewhat below our 2\npercent goal. While I believe cyclical inflationary forces are building, there is some question\nregarding how long it will take to reach our price stability objective.\n\nMonitoring for Evidence of Building Imbalances\nAs a central banker, I want to be vigilant to imbalances and distortions that can build as a result of\naccommodative monetary policy. I have argued that monetary policy accommodation is not “free”\n—there are costs to accommodation in the form of distortions and imbalances in consumer\ndecisions as well as in investing, hiring and other business decisions. More specifically, experience\nsuggests that the greater the overshoot of full employment, the more difficult it is to unwind\nimbalances when growth ultimately slows—as it certainly must.\nWhen excesses ultimately need to be unwound, this can result in a sudden downward shift in\ndemand for investment and consumer related durable goods. There are surprisingly few historical\nexamples of “soft landings” in cases where employment has risen above its maximum sustainable\nlevel.\nIt is of course possible that “this time will be different,” but as I assess the condition of the U.S.\neconomy, I am carefully monitoring evidence that might suggest growing risks of real imbalances,\nwhich could threaten the sustainability of the current economic expansion. For example, the\nheadline unemployment rate has fallen by 70 basis points over the past year, nearly matching the\naverage rate of decline over the prior seven years of the expansion. If this rate of decline continues,\nthis will further tighten labor market conditions and would likely add to excesses and imbalances\naccumulating in the economy.\nExcesses can also manifest themselves in financial imbalances. While I would prefer to rely\nprimarily on macroprudential policy tools to manage financial imbalances, I am nevertheless\nmonitoring various measures of potential financial excess. I monitor these and other market\n4\n\n\fmeasures because I am aware that, as excesses build, we are more vulnerable to reversals which\nhave the potential to cause a rapid tightening in financial conditions, which in turn, can lead to a\nslowing in economic activity. Examples of potential excesses might include:\n\n\nThe U.S. stock market capitalization now stands at approximately 135 percent of GDP, the\nhighest since 1999/2000.3 Correspondingly, commercial real estate cap rates and valuation\nmeasures of debt and other markets appear notably extended.\n\n\n\nMeasures of stock market volatility are historically low.4 We have now gone 12 months\nwithout a 3 percent correction in the U.S. market.5 This is extraordinarily unusual.\n\n\n\nWhile household debt to GDP has improved over the past eight years, corporate debt is\nnow at record highs.6 I am not overly concerned about current levels of corporate debt\nbecause, importantly, financial sector leverage has declined substantially since the Great\nRecession. However, U.S. government debt now stands at approximately 75 percent of\nGDP,7 and the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $49\ntrillion.8 In my view, the projected path of U.S. government debt to GDP is unlikely to be\nsustainable—and has been made to appear more manageable due to today’s historically\nlow interest rates.\n\n\n\nDebt and equity securities trading volumes have markedly declined over the past several\nyears. For example, NYSE equity trading volume on average for 2017 is down 51 percent\nfrom 2007 levels, while the NYSE market cap has increased 28 percent over the same time\nperiod.9 I would also note that margin debt is now at record-high levels.10 In the event of a\nsell-off, high levels of margin debt can encourage additional selling, which could, in turn,\nlead to a more rapid tightening of financial conditions. Sufficient market trading liquidity\nis key to managing the resulting increased volume. I am cognizant that lower trading\nvolumes may be due, in part, to low levels of market volatility and may also be due to\nregulations such as the Volcker rule.\n\nIn the context of managing potential financial imbalances, I believe that we have been well served\nby strong macroprudential bank regulatory policies which have created tough capital requirements\nand regular stress testing for large systemically important institutions. These measures have helped\nguard against excessive debt buildup and creation of other imbalances which often accompany\nelevated levels of asset valuation.\nI strongly favor a prudent review of Dodd–Frank and the Volcker rule, as well as regulatory relief\nfor small- and mid-sized banks. However, I also believe that maintaining strong macroprudential\npolicies for big banks—particularly stringent capital requirements and rigorous annual stress\ntesting—is very important for managing potential financial imbalances at this stage in the\neconomic cycle.\n\n5\n\n\fImplications for the Stance of Monetary Policy\nIn assessing progress in reaching our dual mandate, I am increasingly cognizant of the risks\nposed by potential economic and financial imbalances. Such imbalances, if allowed to build,\nhave the potential to, at some point, threaten the sustainability of the expansion and the\nattainment of our dual-mandate objectives.\nThe FOMC’s stated strategy indicates that when objectives are in conflict—such as appears to be\nthe case today—we are committed to following a “balanced approach” to policy. This approach\ninvolves assessing “other” factors, such as the magnitude of deviations from our longer-run\ninflation goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum\nlevel, as well as the timing of expected return to mandated and/or sustainable levels. Put more\nplainly, even though we are not meeting our inflation objective, the size of the expected full\nemployment overshoot is growing and should be taken into account in assessing appropriate\nmonetary policy actions.\nRegarding inflation, I would reiterate that cyclical forces are building, which should increasingly\noffset the structural forces of technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization.\nI am also mindful that if we wait too long to see actual evidence of inflation, we may get behind\nthe curve and have to subsequently raise rates more rapidly. This type of rapid rate rise has the\npotential to increase the risk of recession.\nLastly, due to the structural headwinds of aging demographics and slowing workforce growth in\nthe U.S. as well as most developed economies, I believe that the neutral nominal rate of interest is\nlikely in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent—materially lower than we are historically accustomed.\nAs such, I think it is important that, to the extent possible, monetary policy accommodation be\nremoved in a gradual and patient manner. I would like to avoid a situation where the FOMC is\nplaying “catch-up” in raising interest rates.\nTaking all these factors into account, and from a risk management point of view, I believe it will\nlikely be appropriate, in the near future, to take the next step in the process of removing monetary\naccommodation. This should be done in the context of an overall strategy of removing\naccommodation in a gradual and patient manner. I believe this strategy will increase the likelihood\nof sustaining and extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\n\n6\n\n\fAppendix A\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers\nincreasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being\nsupplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing\ngoods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop\nfor goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing\nthe pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on\ncreating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by\neducational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college education, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent and the labor force participation rate is 73.7 percent. If\nyou have some college, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent and participation is 65.8 percent; a\nhigh school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.3 percent and participation is 56.9 percent; and\nsome high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.7 percent and participation rate is 46.1\npercent.\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they are retrained, these workers often see their productivity and incomes\ndecline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall\nlabor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—it requires structural reforms. The reforms could include improving early\nchildhood literacy and overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who\ngraduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.11 It would also\ninclude stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to\nimprove employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker\nproductivity. These initiatives could improve educational attainment levels in order to help our\ncitizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major\ncapital projects. It may also help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally\nover the last few years, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and lack of pricing\npower by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins.\n\n7\n\n\f1\n\nSee the statement at: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\nRefers to total participation rate for those age 16 and older; estimates are as of October 2017.

            "content": "Impact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion\nof Key Structural Drivers Affecting U.S.\nMonetary Policy\n\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nOctober 2017\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nPia Orrenius, Keith Phillips, Jason Saving, William Simmons, Mark Wynne, and Mine Yucel in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fImpact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion of Key\nStructural Drivers Affecting U.S. Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nAt the September 2017 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans\nto begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I\nstrongly support the decision to begin the process of reducing the balance sheet. I believe that the\ngradual and phased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important\nmarkets. In the September meeting, the committee also decided to leave the target federal funds\nrate in a range of 100 to 125 basis points but left open the possibility of gradual removals of\naccommodation (i.e., raises in the federal funds rate) in the future.\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding the economic\nimpact of Hurricane Harvey as well as economic conditions in the Eleventh District, U.S. and\nglobally. I will also discuss key structural drivers, such as aging demographics, high levels of\ngovernment debt to gross domestic product (GDP), globalization, and technology-enabled\ndisruption and their implications for U.S. monetary policy.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The\nEleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas\naccounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. GDP1 and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment.2 It is the\nlargest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to more than 50 Fortune 500 companies.3 The\ncharacteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and\nimmigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of Hurricane Harvey and its impact on the\nEleventh District as well as the U.S.\nImpact of Hurricane Harvey\nThe Eleventh District is working to recover from the effects of Hurricane Harvey. It is our basecase assumption that property damage from the storm is likely to be in the range of\napproximately $75-$100 billion. Most of this damage was due to flooding versus wind and other\nforms of hurricane damage. Of that amount, we estimate that approximately $45-$55 billion was\ndue to damage to residential property. In addition, approximately $16-$20 billion was due to\ncommercial property damage, approximately $10-$12 billion was due to vehicle damage and\nanother $6-$10 billion was due to infrastructure damage.4 Unfortunately, some substantial\npercentage of these losses will ultimately prove to be uninsured.\n\n2\n\n\fBefore the storm, the Dallas Fed estimated that multifamily rental housing in Houston had a\nrelatively high vacancy rate. Since the storm, because many displaced homeowners have elected\nto rent (if only temporarily), occupancy rates have risen substantially and the multifamily\noverhang appears to have been eliminated. Further, our contacts suggest that multifamily\ndeveloper/operators in Houston may accelerate their plans to build additional rental housing\ncapacity.\nWe expect some short-term job loss in the Gulf Coast region of Texas in the range of 55,000 to\n75,000 jobs. However, we believe that these losses will prove to be temporary.\nThe storm has also spurred substantial discussion of undocumented workers, in Houston\nspecifically and in Texas generally. It is estimated that approximately 575,000 undocumented\npeople live in the Greater Houston area.5 Our contacts estimate that a substantial percentage of\nconstruction workers in Houston are likely undocumented. In studying the aftermath of other\nsevere-weather events, we note that undocumented workers have historically been critical\nparticipants in the rebuilding and recovery effort.\nThere is significant concern about the potential failure rate of small businesses in Houston due to\nan extended period of business interruption and a significant amount of uninsured losses. In our\nDallas Fed September surveys, 58 percent of respondents who suffered Hurricane Harvey\ndamage reported physical capital losses that were uninsured, and 74 percent of hurricaneimpacted respondents reported lost revenue and/or production that was uninsured.6 We are\nmindful that banks will need to work with borrowers and make tough judgments regarding future\nbusiness viability in order to help the small business community weather this crisis.\nOf course, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity and offshore\nproduction facilities. The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns temporarily\nimpacted oil inventories and gasoline prices. Our estimate is that the refinery industry came\nsubstantially back online by late September. Offshore production has more recently been\nimpacted by Hurricane Nate, which caused substantially all Gulf of Mexico oil production\nfacilities as well as two refineries to temporarily halt operations. While the full impact of the\nmost recent storm has yet to be determined, Dallas Fed economists believe it will likely have\nonly modest and temporary effects on refinery and production operations.\nThe recent hurricanes have not changed our basic outlook regarding global supply and demand\nfor oil. We continue to believe that we are in a fragile equilibrium over the next few years. While\nthere is certainly a risk that oil prices could break to the downside, the Dallas Fed’s baseline\nview is that there will be continued price volatility but within a band between the mid-$40s to the\nmid-$50s for the remainder of 2017 and 2018. Prices moving to the lower end of that range will\ntend to reduce prospective drilling activity, and prices moving to the higher end of that range will\ntend to encourage greater drilling activity.\nOur energy industry contacts continue to indicate that the bulk of their capital spending plans are\nfocused on shale oil production and involve investment in technologies that will create greater\nproduction efficiencies. Our recent Dallas Fed Energy Surveys suggest that the rate of growth in\n3\n\n\fcapital spending on shale oil production has slowed materially relative to earlier in the year.\nSurvey participants also continue to report that, in a number of locations, current market prices\nare above break-even drilling levels, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced economic activity in the Eleventh District\nduring the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the fourth quarter will show a rebound in\neconomic activity that should more than offset the decline in the third quarter. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in\nthree years. Our business outlook surveys suggest continued strong growth in the state’s\nmanufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\nOur study of the aftermath of previous severe storms gives us confidence that, after a period of\nweakness, Texas economic activity will “catch up” and return to previous rates of trend growth.\nOur confidence in this recovery is bolstered by the continued migration (as well as immigration)\nof people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the Texas economy has, over time, become\nincreasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately\n22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.7 Based on these trends, and as the energy\nsector continues to stabilize and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth\nprospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\nThe U.S.\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017 and a\n3.1 percent rate in the second quarter. First-quarter GDP was negatively impacted by weak\nconsumer spending and a deceleration of net inventory investment. The strong second quarter\nwas primarily due to a rebound in consumer spending and a stabilization of inventory\ninvestment.\nOur Dallas Fed economists recently increased their forecast of U.S. GDP growth to\napproximately 2.4 percent in 2017. Embedded in this forecast is a likely drag on third-quarter\nGDP growth due to recent hurricanes. However, we expect a rebound in economic activity in the\nfourth quarter which should substantially offset hurricane-related impacts from the third quarter.\nThe key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a healthy U.S. consumer. The U.S.\nconsumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is\ntoday in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\nIn addition to a healthy consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 will continue to be\nbolstered by some improvement in nonresidential fixed investment and international trade. We\nexpect that this rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, should be sufficient\nto remove any remaining slack from the labor market.\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms could provide upside to this forecast.\nHowever, it is also the case that U.S. policy regarding trade and immigration bears watching and\ncould have some negative impact on future rates of growth.\n4\n\n\fUnemployment and the Impact of Demographic Trends\nThe September jobs report showed a decrease of 33,000 in payroll employment. Our Dallas Fed\neconomists believe that the September report was significantly negatively impacted by recent\nhurricanes, and it will likely take some time to separate “signal” from “noise” in this report.\nEven with the weak September data, the year-to-date average monthly pace of job gains in 2017\nhas been approximately 148,000. This compares to an average of approximately 171,000 through\nAugust 2017 and 187,000 in 2016. As we move toward full employment, I would continue to\nexpect the average rate of job growth to slow, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in\nthe economy.\nIn addition to the most recent headline unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, my economic team\nlooks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and\npeople working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as\nwell as the labor force participation rate.\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) stands at 8.3 percent, which is the lowest rate since June\n2007. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we have moved very close to full\nemployment in the U.S.\nUnemployment At or Near Prerecession Levels\nPercent*\n\n18\nU-6 unemployment rate\n16\n\nHeadline unemployment rate\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\nSep-17\n8.3\n\n8\n\n6\n4.2\n\n4\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n*Seasonally adjusted.\nNOTES: U-6 is the total unemployed, plus marginally attached workers and total employed part time for economic reasons. The shaded bar indicates an NBER\nrecession.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\n5\n\n\fIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at\n63.1 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This\naging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline to below 61 percent.8\nThe likely net impact of this aging trend will be to reduce the rate of labor force growth in the\nUnited States. You can see from the chart below that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth\namong those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due\nto a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age cohort as well\nas a plateauing of the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect these trends to continue as we enter the next decade.\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker\nexpected workforce growth trends will likely negatively affect potential GDP growth in the years\nahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\n\nDeclining Rates of Labor Force and Population Growth\nPercent change, annualized\n\n3.0\n2.71\n2.5\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n2.05\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\nPopulation, 20-64 years old\n\n1.95\n\n1.37\n\n1.27\n1.16\n\n1.0\n\n1.11\n0.84\n\n0.36e\n\n0.5\n\n0.51e\n0.26e\n\n0.0\n1970s\n\n1980s\n\n1990s\n\n2000s\n\n2010s\n\n2020s\n\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics through September 2017 for labor force growth data; Census Bureau for historical and estimated population growth\ndata from 1970s through 2020s.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for\neconomic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as\nunemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for\n6\n\n\fprime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 83 percent for those\nwho have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 77 percent for\nthose with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school\ndiploma.9\nWhile the labor participation rate is disappointing for those with lower levels of educational\nattainment, our Dallas Fed economists also note that there is a substantial skills gap in the U.S.\nThat is, there are more job openings than workers for various types of middle-skills positions.\nThe National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of September 2017, nearly half\nof small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job\nopenings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses,\nconstruction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial\ntechnicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers\nand insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more\nslowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\nWhile a college education is highly correlated with better employment outcomes, it is also the\ncase that the substantial skills gap highlights the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up\npublic/private partnerships that focus on middle-skills training. This training is critical to help\nworkers, who may not have attended college, attain the capabilities needed to find attractive\nemployment in the 21st century economy.\nOne other significant educational concern is the lagging levels of early-childhood literacy among\nfast-growing demographic groups in the U.S. Studies suggest that, if a child begins first grade\nwith reading capability behind grade level, they typically fail to catch up during their educational\ncareer.10 This has significant implications for their ultimate level of educational attainment. As a\nresult of this trend, the Dallas Fed has consistently highlighted the need, nationally and locally,\nto invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of\neducational attainment among our younger population.\nEducation initiatives are an investment in our future. They are likely to help in the effort to\nreduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and more inclusive\nprosperity.\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past\nseveral years. I believe this has likely been due to past strengthening of the dollar and weaker\nenergy prices as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and\ntechnology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\nTwelve-month measures of both headline and core inflation have weakened since February 2017.\nWhile I believe that this recent weakening may well be transitory, I will continue to be patient\nand open-minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n7\n\n\fIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track\nseveral measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most\nextreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe,\nrepresents a more reliable indicator of trend inflation. After running at approximately 1.6 percent\nin 2015, Trimmed Mean PCE inflation gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.9 percent during 2016.\nThrough August 2017, this measure has fallen back to 1.6 percent on a 12-month basis.\nI am of the view that, despite recent weakness, as slack continues to be removed from the labor\nmarket, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. However, I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to\nconfirm that recent weakness is indeed transitory and that we are continuing to make progress in\nreaching our inflation objective.\nTrimmed Mean Inflation Captures Headline Inflation’s Medium-Term Trend\nPercent change, year/year\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\nAug-17\n1.62\n1.5\n\n1.43\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\nHeadline PCE\nTrimmed Mean PCE\n\n0.0\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNOTE: The dashed line represents the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation target.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nNon-U.S.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic\ndevelopments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic\ngrowth domestically. Over the past year, we have seen a broad-based improvement in global\neconomic activity. Brazil and Russia appear to be emerging from recession; Japan and the euro\narea are now growing more robustly.\n8\n\n\fThe United Kingdom is still growing but at a much-reduced rate. The British government is\nworking toward articulating a coherent vision for its post-Brexit arrangements with the European\nUnion. Dallas Fed economists continue to believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be\nmanageable for the U.S.\nDallas Fed economists continue to carefully monitor emerging-market countries, particularly\nChina. As discussed in previous essays, China is challenged by a high degree of overcapacity\n(particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also\nin the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to\none that is based on consumer spending and services. As this transition unfolds, the world is\nlikely going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime,\nChina is working to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first\nquarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and\nlead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic\ngrowth in the U.S.\nBroader Secular Trends\nAs I have discussed in almost all my recent essays and speeches, my economic research team\ncarefully considers and works to understand cyclical forces in the economy as well as several\nkey secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past two years, these drivers are likely having\na powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\n\nAging-workforce demographics in the U.S. and across major economies. As discussed\nearlier, aging-population trends, on balance, reduce labor force participation rates and\nultimately create headwinds for potential GDP growth. These demographic trends are\nalso likely to impact the “dependency ratio”11—that is, they are likely to exacerbate a\nsituation in which an increasing share of the population is depending on those of working\nage to pay for future medical and retirement benefits. These trends are likely to create\nfurther strains on the ability of the U.S. government to manage its fiscal obligations\n(discussed further below).\n\n\n\nLimits to the sustainability of the so-called global debt super cycle. Historically, the U.S.\nand other countries have used increasing public debt—often through tax cuts and higher\ngovernment spending—to boost economic growth. In some countries, such as China,\nlarge quantities of private sector debt have also been used to fuel growth. At this point,\nthere are likely limits to the ability of countries, including the U.S., to further increase\ndebt to GDP in order to bolster economic growth. As I discussed earlier in this essay, we\nhave seen a deleveraging of the U.S. household sector since 2008. As a result, the\nhousehold sector is in much better shape today. However, while household balance sheets\nhave improved since the Great Recession, government debt held by the public stands at\n9\n\n\fthe highest levels since the World War II era12—approximately 75 percent of GDP (see\nchart below)—and the present value of future unfunded entitlements is now estimated at\n$49 trillion.13 These obligations will increasingly work their way into U.S. budget deficits\nover the next five to 10 years—raising questions regarding fiscal sustainability which, if\nnot addressed, could negatively impact longer-run economic growth.\n\nGovernment Debt Levels Have Climbed Significantly\nPercent\n\n80\n\nQ2:2017\n75\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\nFederal debt held by the\npublic as a percent of\nGDP\n\n10\n\n0\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\nNOTES: Debt held by the public excludes intragovernmental holdings. The shaded bars indicate NBER recessions.\nSOURCES: U.S. Treasury; Bureau of Economic Analysis; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\n\n\nGlobalization. Economies, financial markets and companies are more closely intertwined\nthan ever before. For example, regarding trade, estimates indicate that in excess of 40\npercent of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is of U.S. origin.14 Furthermore,\nDallas Fed economists estimate that as much as 70 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico\nare “intermediate goods.”15 This is because much of the U.S. trade with Mexico is related\nto integrated production chains and logistical arrangements between U.S. and Mexican\ncompanies. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that these arrangements have helped improve\ncompetitiveness and create jobs in the U.S. Without these arrangements, these jobs might\nhave otherwise been lost to other areas of the world, particularly Asia.\nWhile trade and globalization have yielded net economic benefits for the U.S. economy,\nthey have also created severe local hardships that the U.S. and other advanced economies\nhave struggled to address. The challenge is how to reap the benefits of globalization\nwhile addressing the disruptions it creates—failing to address these disruptions is likely\n10\n\n\fto reduce public support for global trade, which could have negative implications for the\npace of economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n\n\nTechnology-enabled disruption. In order to improve their competiveness, many\ncompanies are actively investing in technology, which is leading to a significant\nreduction in the number of workers needed to produce goods and services. The result is\nthat U.S. workers across a range of industries are finding that their jobs are being\nrestructured or eliminated. While this trend has increased productivity in most industries,\nI believe one key reason that overall labor productivity growth has been sluggish is that\ndisplaced workers are often going to less-productive jobs. This issue is a key reason I\nhave been emphasizing the need for beefed-up skills training to help displaced workers\nget retrained so they can find more-productive employment. It is also why the Dallas Fed\nhas been working on highlighting the need for early-childhood literacy and other\ninitiatives which could improve educational-attainment levels in order to help our citizens\nbetter thrive in a world which increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nMany industries are also facing a disruptive technology-enabled competitor that is\nthreatening their business model by offering lower cost and greater convenience in the\nsale of goods or services. Think the digital camera versus the old film industry, Amazon\nversus retail stores, Khan Academy versus brick-and-mortar schools, 3-D printing versus\ntraditional manufacturing, Uber and Lyft versus taxis, and so on. This technologyenabled disruption has allowed consumers to achieve better value and more easily\ncomparison shop for merchandise and services. It has also reduced the pricing power of\nmany companies and caused them to intensify their focus on creating greater operational\nefficiencies.\nI believe that the dislocations resulting from technology-enabled disruption are\nsometimes confused with the impacts of globalization. That is, a substantial number of\njob losses may have more to do with technology-enabled disruption even though they\nmay be attributed to globalization.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive\ncompetitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well\nas investing in major capital projects. In my view, it may also help explain the record\nlevel of merger activity globally, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and\nlack of pricing power by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or\nimprove profit margins.\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I\nhave been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy\nto join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the\nkey structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower\nrates of productivity growth as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates\n11\n\n\fof technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a\nsubstitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper fundamental\nchallenges.\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether\nthey help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is\ncomprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the\ncontext of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nI believe that we are making good progress in reaching our full-employment objective. The U.S.\nconsumer is healthy, and business activity continues to strengthen. Global growth has been\nstronger than expected in 2017. While our estimate of 2.4 percent U.S. GDP growth in 2017 is\nsluggish by historical standards, it should be sufficient to continue to remove slack from the\nlabor market.\nNormally, at this stage in the recovery and with a tightening labor market, we would expect to\nsee increasing evidence of inflation pressures. I believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are\nbuilding as we remove slack from the labor market and approach full employment. However, I\nalso believe that these cyclical forces are being at least partially offset by secular forces\n(described earlier in this essay), particularly an intensifying rate of technology-enabled\ndisruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization. These secular forces are likely limiting the\npricing power of businesses and muting inflationary pressures.\nFrom a risk-management point of view, I am mindful that if we wait too long to see signs of\ngreater inflation, we may get “behind the curve” and have to play catch up by increasing rates\nmore rapidly. Historically, this has increased the likelihood of recession.\nI am also mindful that there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to\nsavers as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business\ndecisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless—it carries risks. It has been my\nexperience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very\npainful to address.\nHowever, I believe that structural forces, particularly slowing workforce growth due to an aging\npopulation, will continue to pose challenges for future economic growth. As a result, my view is\nthat the neutral rate, the interest rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is\nlikely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed. Therefore, I have argued that future\nremovals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner.\nBased on these considerations, I intend to keep an open mind about removing accommodation in\nupcoming FOMC meetings. In the months ahead, I will continue to assess the economy’s\n12\n\n\fprogress in removing labor slack, and I will be looking for evidence that building cyclical forces\nhave the prospect of offsetting structural headwinds, such that we can expect to make progress\ntoward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term. Given the strength of the\nU.S. economy, I think it is likely we will see greater evidence of this progress and, as a\nconsequence, it will be appropriate to continue the process of gradually removing monetary\naccommodation.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis, first quarter 2017.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Bureau of Labor Statistics, second quarter 2017.\n3\nSee the 2017 Fortune 500 list of companies headquartered in Texas,\nhttp://fortune.com/fortune500/list/filtered?statename=Texas.\n4\n“Hurricane Irma Losses $58–$83 Billion: Moody’s Analytics,” Artemis, Sept. 13, 2017,\nwww.artemis.bm/blog/2017/09/13/hurricane-irma-economic-losses-58-83-billion-moodys-analytics/.\n5\n“Twenty Metro Areas Are Home to Six-in-Ten Unauthorized Immigrants in the U.S.,” by Jeffrey S.\nPassel and D’Vera Cohn, FactTank, Pew Research Center, Feb. 9, 2017, www.pewresearch.org/facttank/2017/02/09/us-metro-areas-unauthorized-immigrants/.\n6\nTexas Business Outlook Surveys special questions, Sept. 25, 2017.\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tssos/2017/1709/specquest.aspx.\n7\nCensus Bureau.\n8\n“Labor Force Projections to 2024: The Labor Force Is Growing, but Slowly,” Monthly Labor Review,\nBureau of Labor Statistics, December 2015, www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/labor-force-projectionsto-2024.htm.\n9\nCensus Bureau, Current Population Survey 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement,\nwww.census.gov/cps/data/cpstablecreator.html.\n10\nSee “Catch Them Before They Fall: Identification and Assessment to Prevent Reading Failure in\nYoung Children,” by Joseph K.

            "content": "Globalization vs. Technology-Enabled Disruption\nRobert Kaplan\nSeptember 25, 2017\nA number of the pressures that workers air feeling in this country, I think, are being attributed to\nglobalization, meaning people think that maybe immigrants are the cause of job losses. Or they believe\nthat trade is the cause of job losses in many cities and certain industries. And I think both those impacts\nmay have been true to some extent several years ago. I think today, though, is often not always, but\noften far more likely that job losses being experienced by workers and in certain industries is much\nmore due to technology enable disruption than it is to globalization. Even though the narratives\nsometimes it's being attributed to globalization, I think it has more to do with disruption. I think there\nhave been millions of jobs that have been either redesigned or lost or changed or whole industries. For\nexample. The film industry is a good example. The camera industry that's been dramatically changed\nbecause of technology enabled disruption and the reason I like to step back and site. The difference\nbetween these two causes is if we misdiagnose why things were happening. I if we mistakenly attribute\nsome of these job losses to globalization, we may actually make decisions from a policy point of view\nthat could make us even less competitive, create more job losses on bake poor policy decisions.\n\n\f"

            "content": "What Is Technology-Enabled Disruption?\nRobert Kaplan\nSeptember 25, 2017\nTechnology enabled disruption means to me: Business models are being altered by the use of\ntechnology. Technology is being used to find either lower price, create lower price, greater convenience\nor other features that are changing the nature of competition. So let me talk about some of the impacts\nof disruption that that I think we're seeing at the Dallas Fed on at the Federal Reserve. First impact, I\nthink, is on inflation in that there's a cyclical element of inflation, and I think there's a structural element\nof inflation. The cyclical element of inflation is, is the labor market tightens and slack comes out of the\nlabor market. We would normally see some wage pressure, greater wage pressure and eventually with a\nlag that would be passed on to price pressures. We're not seeing that, uh, in the same way we have in\nthe past at this level of unemployment, and I think part of the reason is structural in that technology\nenabled disruption means workers are increasingly being replaced by technology, which I think may may\nbe having some impact on wages. In addition, businesses have much less pricing power because\nconsumers can so easily shop for the lowest price on DSO. The impact of that is businesses are more\nlikely having to resort to cost savings, further replacing workers with technology in order to be\ncompetitive because they know they are unlikely to be able to price to pass on price increases to the\nconsumers to their customers. And so I think this is likely having some muted impact on inflation.\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, Mr. Ambassador (Ed Djerejian), for hosting me this evening. I am honored to have\nbeen chosen to give my last speech as a Federal Reserve official to the Baker Institute’s\nFounding Director’s Lecture Series.\nJim Baker is, himself, an institution; I admire him greatly. Few individuals in the history of this\ncountry—I think the only others may be George Shultz and the late Elliot Richardson—have\nheld as many cabinet posts as Jim. And few are as loyal a friend.\nJim and I were cabin mates on an elk hunting trip on the high plains of Utah last fall. As you may\nknow, he is a crack shot and a skilled hunter. We spent the first few hours after arrival at our\ncampsite practicing at the range. While I missed every single shot, Jim effortlessly placed every\none of his squarely in the bull’s-eye, at every distance. And yet the next day, within an hour of\nour setting out in a light snow and bitter cold, on my very first shot, I dropped a big bull that had\nlong evaded his ultimate fate. That bull’s nickname was Hugh Hefner—he was old and always\nhad a dozen or so cows with him. Hugh Hefner the elk had an impressive, wide-spread six by six\npoint rack; he was a true trophy. I was proud of my little accomplishment and told Jim about it\nimmediately and repeatedly through the day.\nThe next two days, Jim returned without firing a single shot. He said he “just couldn’t find\nanything worth shooting.” But I suspect that he held himself back simply to allow me to have my\nbragging rights for the trip. That’s the kind of gentleman Jim Baker is. (Though I feel compelled\nto tell you he did not hold himself back in loudly winning the snoring contest we had in our\ncabin: In addition to all his accomplishments, including his kindness to neophyte hunters like me,\nJim Baker should be on the list of the world’s great snorers!)\nIt Ain’t Brag if It’s True\nOn the bragging rights front, I have thoroughly enjoyed using my perch at the Fed to spread the\nstory of Texas’ economic success. Last Friday, I shared some statistics about our state with an\naudience in Dallas.1 Like this one: 1,605,576,000,000. Do you know what that represents? No, it\nis not the number of “likes” or followers that Houston native Beyoncé has on social media,\nalthough that number might be up there. If you place a dollar sign before it, $1,605,576,000,000\nis the estimated gross state product of Texas for 2014. One trillion, six hundred and five billion,\nfive hundred and seventy-six million dollars. That is the amount of output Houstonians and their\nfellow Texans produced last year—roughly equivalent to the output of Canada, our great\nneighbor to the north.\n2\n\n\f$ 1,605,576,000,000\n2014 Texas Economic Output\n(Estimated)\n\nThere has been strong momentum building up to that number. Just since I came to the Dallas Fed\nin 2005, my staff estimates that the real Texas economy has grown by $382 billion, or 36\npercent. That increment equates to adding more than the entire output of Norway, my mother’s\nhomeland and now one of the world’s richest nations measured on a per capita basis.\nTo put Texas in global perspective, my staff put together this tongue-in-cheek map of the United\nStates that compares the output of each state of the union with an international counterpart.\n\n3\n\n\fI am not sure my friends in Rhode Island—whose wonderful Bryant University awarded me an\nhonorary doctorate last June—will much appreciate their output being compared to that of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Or that another cabinet member named Richardson—Bill\nRichardson, who went on to become governor of New Mexico—will like seeing that New\nMexico produces the economic equivalent of Serbia. Or that my colleagues in New York will\ncotton to having the same output level as Iran. But there you are: Texas is the second-largest\neconomic engine in the country, behind only California. But I rather like pointing out that\nCalifornia can be compared to Italy, for unless it corrects its course of over-taxation and\nregulation, it will surely end up with an economy very much like that of the Repubblica Italiana.\nU.S. Economic Landscape\nNow enough of the Texas braggadocio, even though it happens to be true. This is my final\nspeech at the Fed and I want to address some of the more pressing issues facing my counterparts\non the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the months ahead.\nFirst, it helps to put the size of the U.S. economy in perspective. In 2014, the U.S. produced\n$17.4 trillion in goods and services. Just since I arrived at the Dallas Fed 10 years ago, the U.S.\nhas increased its total level of real output approximately $2.2 trillion. In sum, the U.S. is a huge,\nmuscular economy.\nWhat is the muscle tone of our economy? Where are we presently in terms of growth and from\nthe perspective of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maintaining price stability and\nproviding the monetary conditions to underwrite full employment?\n4\n\n\fHere is a simple “dashboard” we use at the Dallas Fed to encapsulate the economy’s current\ncondition:\n\nU.S. Economic Dashboard\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n0.5\n\n8\n\n5\n4\n\n9\n\n4.12\n3\n\nJunk-bond\nspread (%)\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n10\n\n6.5\n\n6.02\n\n5.5\n\n!\n5\n\n2.4\n\nHigh-yield\ncorp. debt (%)\n\n11\n\n-1\n\n5.5\n6\n\n4.5\n5\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n5.5\n\nPercent of GDP per capita recovered\n\n5\n\n10.5\n\n1 0 2 . 7\n\n4.5\n\nEngine Unemp.

In an\neconomy propelled by household and business spending, it is helpful to get a grasp of the\nfeelings of the average American consumer. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment\nSurvey does just that, and right now it is telling us that consumers feel better than they did on\naverage from 2002 to 2007. It had been a long time since hope sprang eternal, but 2014 was a\nhuge year for rebuilding consumer confidence.\n\n5\n\n\fConsumer Sentiment Has Soared Recently to the\nHighest Level in Over a Decade\nIndex, 2002–2007=100\n120\nFeb.\n107\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n'02\n\n'03\n\n'04\n\n'05\n\n'06\n\n'07\n\n'09\n\n'08\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\n'14\n\n'15\n\nSOURCE: University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey.\n\nEnter Prince: ‘Gonna Party Like It’s 1999’?\nDespite increased consumer sentiment, the U.S. experienced very uneven gross domestic product\n(GDP) growth during 2014. This was partly a result of severe winter weather and partly a result\nof the Affordable Care Act rollout, which disrupted the pattern of household health care\nexpenditures. For the year as a whole, growth looks to have averaged out to around 2½ percent.\nThat may not sound like much at first blush, but it was enough to give us a 1.1 percentage-point\ndrop in the unemployment rate and the largest job gains since 1999.2 You might not have\nexpected that at the beginning of the year if you had listened to the gloom-and-doomers. The\nmusician Prince (or should I call him by one of his other names: “the artist formerly known as\nPrince,” Joey Coco, Alexander Nevermind or that\nsang “gonna party like it’s 1999.”\n\nsymbol?) must have foreseen this when he\n\nSo, are we going to rock on? Should we look for more of the same in 2015? Or should we be\nreminded of another lyric from Prince: “… parties weren’t meant to last”? Again, we need to put\nthings in perspective.\nThe Wall Street Journal recently published an article that included a chart comparing the level of\nreal GDP in the current expansion with that of four prior expansions. In that chart, the current\nexpansion finished dead last, with output well behind what one might have expected based on the\neconomy’s performance during the late 1970s and the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\n6\n\n\fJudging by Real GDP, This Has Been the Weakest of\nFive Recent Economic Expansions…\nIndex, NBER trough = 100\n130\n\n1982\n\n125\n1975\n120\n\n1991\n2001\n\n115\n2009\n110\n105\n100\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nYears into recovery\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSOURCES: “U.S. Economy Hits Speed Bumps,” by Josh Mitchell, The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 30, 2015;.\nNational Bureau of Economic Research; Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThis picture changes markedly, though, if you divide GDP by the available labor force. Then the\ncurrent expansion is tied with that of the 1990s and edges out those of the 1970s and 2000s.\nReally, all four of those expansions lie almost on top of one another, as the following chart\nshows. Only the recovery from the 1981–82 recession stands out. The implication is that the\nweak GDP growth we’ve seen during the current expansion is entirely explained by weak labor\nforce growth.\n\n7\n\n\f…But, Divide GDP by the Labor Force and the\nCurrent Expansion is Not at All Unusual\nIndex, NBER trough = 100\n120\n\n1982\n\n115\n2009\n1991\n110\n\n2001\n1975\n\n105\n\n100\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nYears into recovery\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSOURCES: National Bureau of Economic Research; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSo why has labor force growth been weak? Demographics have played a big role. Population\ngrowth has slowed from 2¼ percent per year in the mid-1970s to 1 percent per year today, and\nmore and more baby boomers—old codgers like me and Ambassador Djerejian—are pushing\nretirement age. The combined effect of these trends is that growth in the working-age (16 to 64)\npopulation has slowed to just 0.5 percent per year.3 In addition, a higher proportion of young\npeople are attending college than in the past, and the huge flow of women from the home to the\nworkplace has largely run its course.4 The recession of 2008–09 undoubtedly pushed many\npeople into premature retirement. It’s doubtful, though, whether enough of them can be brought\nback into the job market at this point to move the participation rate appreciably higher.\nIn sum, labor force growth has been anemic because of slow growth in the working-age\npopulation and because, for reasons that have nothing to do with monetary policy, the labor force\nparticipation rate for those of working age has stopped rising and started trending downward.\nLabor force growth is likely to remain anemic over at least the next couple of years. With the\nworking-age population growing at only 0.5 percent per year, the dividing line between a rising\nand a falling unemployment rate is less than 100,000 jobs per month for any realistic assumption\nabout labor force participation.\nThe point is that economic growth at the pace we saw in 2014 will very quickly drive us to and\npast the 5 to 5.5 percent unemployment range regarded as sustainable by most policymakers and\nprivate analysts. A repeat of 2014’s performance would put us around 4.5 percent unemployment\nby year-end.\n\n8\n\n\fThe sustainable—or in Fedspeak, the “natural” rate of unemployment—varies over time with\nchanges in educational attainment and the demographic composition of the labor force. At any\npoint in time, estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. We have to be constantly alert to\nthe possibility that current estimates are mistaken. Still, given the dangers associated with\novershooting full employment, I believe it behooves monetary policymakers to be cautious. With\nall the benefits of hindsight, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of\nunemployment has averaged 5.6 percent and has never fallen below 5 percent in the United\nStates going all the way back to 1948.\nSome commentators point to subdued wage growth as evidence that substantial labor market\nslack remains. Taking policy cues from present wage growth, though, would move us into\ndangerous territory indeed. Slack responds to monetary policy with a lag, and wage growth\nresponds with a lag to slack, so current wage growth is a very backward-looking measure of\npolicy’s stance. Moreover, research conducted at the Dallas Fed has demonstrated that wage\ngrowth’s response to labor market slack is highly nonlinear: The response gets stronger and\nstronger as slack diminishes.5 The gradual increase in wage growth that we’ve seen to date is\nentirely consistent with historical experience once lags and nonlinearity are taken into account.\nThe red lines in these two graphs will show you how we tracked from the beginning of 2011 to\nthe end of 2014 in terms of wage growth detrended by inflation expectations (the vertical axis)\nrelative to the declining unemployment rate (the horizontal axis), and then where we at the\nDallas Fed expect to be at the end of 2015.\n\nWage Growth Has Gradually Increased,\nNow Exceeding Expected Longer-Run Price Inflation\nDetrended wage growth*\n2.5\n\nTime series from 1984:Q1–2010:Q4\n\n2.0\n\nLeast squares regression,\nestimated 1984:Q1–2008:Q2\n\n1.5\n\n’85:Q3\n\n1.0\n\n’85:Q2\n\n0.5\n'14:Q4\n0.0\n’09:Q1\n-0.5\n’09:Q2\n-1.0\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n'11:Q1\n\n’09:Q3\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nUnemployment rate, lagged 4Q\nNOTE: Detrended wage growth is year-over-year growth in ECI wages less SPF 10-year inflation expectations.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Survey of Professional Forecasters;\nDallas Fed calculations..\n\n9\n\n\fDallas Fed Expects a Further Increase in Wage Growth—\nto 2.4 Percent—by End of 2015\nDetrended wage growth*\n2.5\n\nTime series from 1984:Q1–2010:Q4\n\n2.0\n\nLeast squares regression,\nestimated 1984:Q1–2008:Q2\n\n1.5\n\n’85:Q3\n\n1.0\n\n’85:Q2\n'15:Q4\n\n0.5\n\n'14:Q4\n0.0\n’09:Q1\n-0.5\n’09:Q2\n-1.0\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n'11:Q1\n\n’09:Q3\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nUnemployment rate, lagged 4Q\nNOTE: Detrended wage growth is year-over-year growth in ECI wages less SPF 10-year inflation expectations.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Survey of Professional Forecasters;\nDallas Fed calculations..\n\nLiftoff!\nSome highly respected observers would have the Fed wait until we “see the whites of fullemployment’s eyes” before it starts raising interest rates or shrinking its $2.5 trillion bond\nportfolio. Would pushing past full employment really be so bad? So what if inflation rises,\ntemporarily, above target? Can’t we do an after-the-fact course correction if it should turn out\nthat policy has been too accommodative?\nThere’s certainly something to the argument that it’s okay to go off your diet from time to time,\nespecially if your weight has been running below target. But you can’t consistently binge without\ngetting into trouble. Sooner or later, you have to bring your caloric intake back to normal, lest\nyour weight and your waistline balloon and your health deteriorate. In the monetary policy\nsphere, unfortunately, cutting back has proven to be even more difficult than it is in personal\nweight control. In the real world, one never sees the smooth, moderately sized unemployment\nincreases that our simple mathematical models so readily generate. A recessionary dynamic\nkicks in whenever the unemployment rate rises by more than a few tenths of a percentage point.\nThe problem with overshooting full employment to any significant degree is that it has always\nset the stage for a new recession. Gaining weight (reducing the unemployment rate) is easy.\nAttempts to lose weight (to stem overheating of the economy) seem always to get out of control\nand land us in the hospital. Every time the Fed has tightened policy after achieving full\nemployment, it has driven the economy into recession.\n\n10\n\n\fIt’s because of this dynamic, and my desire to prolong the current expansion, that I have argued\nthat we should begin reducing policy accommodation earlier than many of my colleagues on the\nFOMC appear to prefer.\nThere’s every indication that solid, above-potential growth in employment and output is going to\ncontinue through the summer of 2015. The unemployment rate is likely to reach the bottom of\nthe range of natural-rate estimates within that time frame. So if we are serious about limiting\nfull-employment overshoot, I posit that prompt action to scale back policy accommodation is\nlikely to prove imperative. The idea that we can substitute a steeper future funds-rate path for an\nearly liftoff seems risky to me. I would rather the FOMC raise rates early and gradually than late\nand steeply.\nThe credibility of a “later and steep” policy strategy is suspect, it seems to me. Isn’t it possible—\neven likely—that the public will interpret a decision to defer liftoff as a signal that the committee\nis generally “dovish” and generally disinclined to raise rates? In other words, mightn’t the public\nsee the choice as between “earlier and gradual” and “later and gradual” rather than between\n“earlier and gradual” and “later and steep”?\nI have felt that were we to begin liftoff—I have been eager to use this term in this town for some\ntime, especially with Ellen Ochoa, the director of Johnson Space Center and the chair of the\nHouston Branch board of directors sitting right here in front of me!—earlier in 2015, markets\nwould have more confidence about the “gradual” in “earlier and gradual.” Otherwise, as some of\nmy colleagues have stated publicly, if we were to defer liftoff until, say, December 2015 but plan\nto raise rates quickly thereafter, people have to wait until January 2016 to determine whether the\nFOMC is serious. Early and gradual is quickly verified. Later and steep requires a high level of\ntrust. It is certainly no stretch to think that the public might not completely buy into the “steep”\nin “later and steep.”\nAnd what about the incentive to renege? January 2016 arrives. Suppose that the public has, in\nfact, not bought into the FOMC’s promises of a steeper funds rate path. What if the Fed’s\nsurveys of market operators and dealers reveal that financial bets and commitments have been\nmade such that a move to raise rates appears likely to incite financial market turbulence? Might\nfuture policymakers then be strongly tempted to back down?\nInflation Outlook\nIn the aviary of central bankers, I am known as a “hawk,” even though I have not spoken of the\nthreat of immediate inflation since 2008, when we had an inflationary scare before having the\nlegs pulled out from the table of the economy with the implosion of Lehman Brothers and the\nfinancial superstructure. You may wonder how I view the minimal inflation, or even deflationary\npressure, some commentators seem to be worrying about.\n\n11\n\n\fThe FOMC is trying its level best to understand the dynamics of inflation. We have declared a 2\npercent intermediate target for inflation, which seems to be standard for most central banks.\nHeadline inflation measures show a significant shortfall from that target. The headline personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.5 percent in January. Its 12-month increase\nwas just 0.2 percent, down from 1.6 percent in June. Should this low, and still falling, rate of\nprice inflation retard the date of the liftoff from the zero-interest-rate policy we have been\noperating for more than six years?\nI think not. Especially here in Houston, folks know that headline inflation is being held down by\nthe big decline in energy prices that began in the second half of 2014. But we should also know\nthat once energy prices stabilize, headline inflation is likely to bounce right back up. Policy\nneeds to take past inflation into account, but it needs to take future inflation into account, too.\nFor policy purposes, it is inflation’s medium-term trend that matters. That’s why, in evaluating\nprogress toward our price-stability objective, I pay close to zero attention to realized headline\ninflation. I pay nearly as little attention to conventional core inflation, which excludes food and\nenergy prices. I prefer the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE core inflation measure, which each\nmonth excludes the most extreme upward and downward price movements, regardless of their\nsource. Here’s a graph of the current trend of both headline and Trimmed Mean PCE inflation:\n\nWhile Headline Inflation is Half What It Was Last Summer,\nTrimmed Mean Inflation Has Held Relatively Steady\n12-month percent change\n5\nHeadline PCE price index\n\nTrimmed Mean PCE\n\n4\n“Mandate-consistent” 2% level\n3\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n0.2\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n'05\n\n'06\n\n'07\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\n'14\n\n'15\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nA good core inflation measure strips the noise out of headline inflation and leaves the signal. The\ntrimmed mean inflation rate has, so far, held pretty steady in the face of the drop in energy prices\nand the appreciation of the dollar. It would not surprise me to see some decline in the trimmed\nmean run rate, as we did last month, in the near term; but I think that the decline will likely be\n12\n\n\ftemporary. The inflation trend should reverse later this year, assuming that energy prices don’t\nfall further and that the dollar stabilizes.\nIf you go to the Dallas Fed website, you will see our most recent posting: The 12-month trimmed\nmean rate slipped slightly to 1.5 percent, just below the range of 1.6 to 1.7 percent it’s occupied\nevery month since April 2014.6 While 1.5 percent is lower than the FOMC is shooting for, it’s a\nwhole lot less discouraging than a headline inflation reading of almost nil. At the end of the year,\ntrimmed mean inflation is more likely to be above its current 1.5 percent rate than below.\nJanet Yellen Is No Mae West!\nThat’s probably about all the interpreted Fedspeak you can handle in an evening, so perhaps I\ncan leave you with a few simple takeaways. The U.S. economy is improving. We are\napproaching any sensible measure of full employment. And even though the numeric inflation\ntarget for the intermediate term has not been reached, we have reasonable price dynamics that are\nunlikely to threaten further economic growth and continued job creation as long as the FOMC\ndoesn’t flinch from beginning to normalize policy on a timely basis.\nWe will see. In a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, I quoted Mae West: “I\ngenerally avoid temptation,” she said, “unless I can’t resist it.”\nI think I am safe in saying that Janet Yellen is no Mae West. I leave the Fed with the high\nexpectation that she will ably lead the FOMC down the path of normalizing monetary policy and\nresist any temptation to delay for too long that path-changing task.\nEd, thank you for letting me speak here tonight. I thank the people of Houston and all of Texas\nfor allowing me the privilege of serving for a decade as president and CEO of the Eleventh\nDistrict’s Federal Reserve Bank. The past 10 years have been challenging but immensely\nrewarding. Indeed, in my farewell letter to my staff, I suggested that given the crisis we went\nthrough, the life of a Fed president should be measured in dog years. So I thank you all for\nletting me lead your Federal Reserve Bank for the past 70 years.\nGoodnight, God bless you, and God bless Texas.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Homage to Texas, the Great People of Dallas and the Staff of the Dallas Fed,” speech by Richard\nW.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas\nMarch 6, 2015\n\n1\n\n\fHomage to Texas, the Great People of Dallas\nand the Staff of the Dallas Fed\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you Ralph (Hawkins). I am honored to be speaking to the Dallas Regional Chamber of\nCommerce as I finish my 10-year tenure as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nDallas.\nComing to Dallas\nI first came to Dallas in 1973, and I remember one thing above all: A palpable sense that this was\na “can-do” town in a “must-do” state.\nBefore settling here, I worked on Wall Street and lived in Washington, D.C., serving in the U.S.\nTreasury. I learned from each of those experiences and enjoyed them. But having experienced\nthe dynamism of Dallas, I couldn’t wait to return here and make this my home. I specifically\nrecall taking my firstborn son, Anders, on a ferry to see the Statue of Liberty in 1979. We\nreturned to Manhattan as the sun was setting. The Big Apple glimmered in the gold light of the\nsetting sun. But holding my little boy in my arms, I thought to myself: This is a glorious city, but\nNew York is fast losing its right to name itself the Empire State. New York is the past; Texas’\nLone Star illuminates the real empire state. It was at that very moment that I decided Dallas is\nwhere I ought to plant my roots and raise my son and those children who will follow him.\nI was right. And I thank Ray Hunt and others who are here today, and Jim Collins, Stanley\nMarcus, Charlie Pistor, Johnny Johnson, Irvin Levy, Bob Strauss and others who have since\ndeparted this earth but are still vivid in my memory and hold a special place in my heart, for\nencouraging me out of the wilderness, bringing me to economic nirvana.\nThe Sweet Ambrosia of Texas Brag: In Context\nNow, whenever foreigners—columnists from the New York Times for example—think I am\nsimply intoxicated with the ambrosia of Texas Brag, I like to walk them through the facts, not\nthe lore.\nHere is a fact—a number—that focuses the mind.\n\n2\n\n\f$ 1,605,576,000,000\n2014 Texas Economic Output\n(Estimated)\n\n$1,605,576,000,000: That is the estimated gross state product of Texas, the amount of output we\nproduced in 2014. It is roughly equivalent to the output of Canada, our great neighbor to the\nnorth.\nAnd with each passing day, Texas gains momentum.\nWe estimate that the real Texas economy grew by $382 billion, or 36 percent, between 2005 and\n2014. That increment equates to adding more than the entire output of the country of Norway,\nmy maternal homeland and now one of the world’s richest nations measured on a per capita\nbasis. Or to bring it closer to home, that’s almost the equivalent of gaining the sum total of the\neconomic capacity of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\nThese sorts of comparisons provide for great cocktail conversation. So might this: a tongue-incheek map of the United States that has been assembled by my staff that compares the output of\neach state of the union with an international counterpart.\n\n3\n\n\fRhode Island—whose wonderful Bryant University awarded me an honorary doctorate last\nJune—produces the economic equivalent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And New\nMexico produces the economic equivalent of Serbia, Oklahoma equates to Belarus, and Arkansas\nproduces the equivalent of Kenya. It is noteworthy to me that the old Empire State, New York,\ntoday produces the economic equivalent of Iran. To be sure, California still out-produces us by a\nsignificant margin. But I rather like pointing out that it can be compared to Italy, for unless it\ncorrects its course of over-taxation and regulation, it will surely end up with an economy very\nmuch like that of the Repubblica Italiana.\nJobs Are Paramount\nWe in Dallas understand that the route to dignity is a job. Working women and men are proud\nwomen and men. Nobody wants to be dependent on handouts from the state; they want to pull\nthemselves up by the bootstraps of hard work.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged with a “dual mandate”: Preserving price stability and creating the\nmonetary conditions to enable full employment. Here is the record of Texas in creating jobs,\ngoing back to 1990:\n\n4\n\n\fTexas has outperformed the rest of the U.S. in the pace of job creation by a greater than 2-to-1\nmargin for more than two decades. For every 100 jobs that existed here 25 years ago, we have 68\nnet new jobs today. The former center of the industrial revolution driven by Henry Ford and the\nauto magnates, Michigan, has created only seven net new jobs; New York has created 10; the\nLand of Lincoln, Illinois, has created 12. Even California, the epicenter of cyberspace, has\ncreated only 25 jobs for every 100 that existed in 1990.\nAnd here is a slide my staff has given me as a parting gift: The growth in jobs since I assumed\nthe helm at the Dallas Fed almost a decade ago.\n\n5\n\n\fOf course, I’d like to take credit for this spectacular outperformance by Texas in enabling the\npeople of Texas to realize their economic potential. But I can’t. I can only say that I have been\nlucky to have helmed the Dallas Fed during a time when Texas and its great cities like Dallas\nhave blossomed and clearly outpaced the rest of America. Since April 2005, Texas has created\nmore than 2.2 million of the 7.1 million jobs gained by the country as a whole. That means Texas\naccounted for almost a third of net job gains seen in the U.S. over the past 10 years, while only\nconstituting 8.5 percent of the country’s population.\n‘Bull Droppings’\nMy “foreign” friends will say “but you only create low-paying jobs in Texas” or “they are all in\nthe oil and gas sector.” The Wall Street Journal, cleaning up my two-word response to this\nassertion last month, quoted me as saying this myth was “bull droppings.”1\nHere are the facts: Between 2000 and 2014, the United States economy ex-Texas (that is, were\nwe allowed to secede statistically—and only statistically, mind you—from the union) has\nexperienced job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles of workers, the muscle and fiber\nof our country. As you can see from this chart, Texas has indeed outperformed the rest of the\nU.S. in creating low-income jobs. But we have also outperformed in creating jobs in every\nincome quartile.\n\n6\n\n\fAnd Texas has seen job creation across a widely diverse swath of industrial groups, as is evident\nfrom this slide of jobs created by sector last year:\n\n7\n\n\f2014: A Year of Records for Texas\n2014 was a year of records: State output climbed to new heights; employment growth was broadbased across industries and income groups; the state reached new highs for income per person;\nTexas was again the top migration destination from other U.S. states; we had the highest\npercentage of home mortgages with positive equity; construction contract values reached a new\nrecord; and oil and gas production soared along with refining capacity and exports of petroleum\nproducts.2\nTexas grew 3.4 percent from December 2013 to December 2014, and yet, if one has been reading\nmajor U.S. newspapers recently, it has been nearly all doom and gloom for Texas. To which I\nsuppose I should once again say: “Bull… droppings!” To be sure, hydrocarbon prices have\nmoved sharply lower the past seven months; but Texas is a diversified economy. The state has\nbenefited from high oil prices, being the sixth largest oil producer and the top oil services\nprovider in the world. So, of course, lower oil prices are a headwind to economic growth here.\nBut my researchers at the Dallas Fed don’t see recession in the cards, simply a downgrade to\ngrowth to something more like 2 percent, which would be a slower pace of growth than the\nnation for the first time since 2003.\nDallas Fed Facts\nThe dynamism of our state is also reflected in the activity I have personally witnessed during my\ntenure at the Dallas Fed. The Dallas Fed operates out of its headquarters in Dallas and through its\nbranches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso. In April 2005 our total Bank assets were $35\nbillion. At the end of 2014, our assets were $160 billion. Some 600 more banks and bank\nbranches are ordering and/or receiving currency from the Dallas Fed since 2005. The Bank’s onsite holdings of cash increased nearly 170 percent from 2005 to 2014, from $137 billion to over\n$368 billion.\nAnd our loan portfolio has expanded significantly: The Dallas Fed made 1,764 loans through our\ndiscount window for a total of $68,522,804,000 during my watch as president and CEO. I\napproved each and every one of these loans personally. I’m happy to report that we didn’t lose a\npenny on a single one of them.\nLast but not unimportantly, in 2005 we distributed from our operating profits at the Dallas Fed\n$1.1 billion to the U.S. Treasury; last year, we distributed $3.4 billion. Over the course of my\ndecade in this job, the Dallas Fed has distributed a total of $23 billion to the U.S. Treasury. You\nare looking at one of 12 people—the 12 presidents of the nation’s Federal Reserve banks—who\nactually pay down the nation’s deficit!\nThe men and women of the Dallas Fed serve Texas and our nation well. I’m extremely proud of\nthem.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Good People of the Fed\nThose who have taken the time to read some of the 155 published speeches I have given over the\npast decade know that I like to illustrate a point and put things in context by drawing on\nliterature. So I am going to use a literary reference to put in context the blessing and privilege of\nserving alongside the people I have worked with at the Dallas Fed and in our branches, the good\nwomen and men who guided me through 96 regular and special meetings of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee under three Fed chairmen, the many conference calls Ben Bernanke held\nduring the financial crisis, a decade of Conference of Presidents meetings where we organize the\noperations of the Federal Reserve System, and the day-in, day-out handling of our business\noperations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and El Paso.\nOne of my all-time favorite books was a gift from Anders, the son I carried in my arms on that\nfateful day after visiting the Statue of Liberty. It is titled The Match. It details in beautifully\nwritten, poignant prose a legendary round played at Cyprus Point in 1956 between two of golf’s\ngreatest professionals, Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan, and the two great amateurs of the time,\nKen Venturi and Harvie Ward. But it is more than a golf book. It spoke to me in a way few\noutside the hallowed halls of the Fed might understand.\nIn the afterword of The Match, the author, Mark Frost, laments the transformation of golf into a\nbig-money sport from its origins and long tradition of honorable competition played by decent\nmen simply for the honor of serving the game. “Not enough of the meaningful prizes in life are\ncontested solely for honor anymore, for the love of the thing itself, or the undiluted satisfaction\nof testing your mettle against the best you can find and, win or lose, walking away the better for\nit because of the truths it enabled you to face and find out about yourself.”\nI didn’t take the job at the Dallas Fed for money; I gave up a lot of money to take that job. But I\ngave up what I was doing for something far better.\nFor 10 years now, I have been privileged to work alongside the most decent men and women at\nthe Fed who are there solely for the honorable tradition of central banking, for the love of the\nthing itself. I have tested whatever mettle I have been able to muster against the most thoughtful\nand brilliant, earnest, devoted and articulate people I have ever known. And I had the privilege of\ndoing so in the most civil and dignified forum in the government of the greatest country on earth,\nduring one of the most challenging periods in its 239-year history. I have won some arguments; I\nhave lost plenty. I say goodbye to them now, better for the truths they enabled me to learn not\nonly about economics and monetary policy and operating a Federal Reserve Bank but about\nmyself. They have provided me with the most meaningful experience of my professional life.\n\n9\n\n\fTexas Jockeys Secretariat\nOn May 10, 2005, I gave my first speech in Dallas as president and CEO of the Dallas Fed to the\nWorld Affairs Council. Today, I give my last speech to you.\nI conclude by saying I am a proud Dallasite and a proud Texan. But I am above all a proud\nAmerican. This great country took my parents in and enabled their child—me—to live the\nAmerican dream.\nHaving lived that dream, I harbor no doubts about my country’s future. During the recent\nfinancial crisis, I admit to having some doubts; I was given to saying that relative to all other\neconomies, America’s was “the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” Now I phrase it\ndifferently. Just look at the job creation numbers announced this morning: The nation’s payrolls\nincreased by 295,000 in February, and the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.5 percent,\napproaching what many consider the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment that most\neconomists think we are capable of achieving.\nIf you parse the figures, you will understand what makes me grin from ear to ear: 288,000 of\nthose jobs were created by the private sector; only 7,000 by government. Compare that to Europe\nor Japan or China or whomever else the naysayers have claimed will lap us. Nowhere on the\nplanet are there businessmen and women who are the equal to ours in entrepreneurship and\ninnovation and determination to master the process of creative destruction and make it work for\nthe betterment of all people. And nowhere in America is that done better than right here in Dallas\nand in Texas.\nHere is the image I now have in mind for the American economy.\n\n10\n\n\fWe are the economic equivalent of Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes in 1973 by 31\nlengths. We are the best-looking, the strongest and the fastest horse on the global track. And\nsitting atop that magnificent thoroughbred, goading and guiding it to greatness, is the best jockey\none can imagine: Texas.\nThank you. Thank you for allowing me the honor and privilege of serving you this past decade.\n\nNotes\n1\n\n“Plunging Oil Prices Test Texas’ Economic Boom,” by Jon Hilsenrath, Ana Campoy and Ben\nLeubsdorf, The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 4, 2015.\n2\nOf note, according to the CoreLogic Third Quarter 2014 Equity Report, Houston and Dallas are the\nnation’s top major metros for the highest percentage of residences with positive equity: 97.5 and 97.0\npercent, respectively.\n\n11\n\n\f"

            "content": "Remarks Upon Acceptance of the\nMexican Order of the Aztec Eagle\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nMexico City, Mexico\nFebruary 17, 2015\n\n\fRemarks Upon Acceptance of the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle\nRichard W. Fisher\nMy relationship with Mexico has been a lifetime affair.\nIt starts with a little boy who walked every morning in his gray flannel shorts and white shirt, a\ngreen leather satchel strapped to his back, from his home on Calle Monte Tauro to the Maud\nCrocker School.\nAlong the way, tortilleras would treat him to heavily buttered and salted handmade tortillas that,\nby the time he arrived at school, would leave stains on his shirt, incurring the wrath of his\nmaestras.\nThose maestras taught him math so well, it formed the basis for his career as an investor and\nbanker. And despite the punishment they meted out for the butter-stained shirts, to this day\nwhenever he goes to a Mexican restaurant in Texas, he always asks first for a tortilla that he\ncovers in butter and salt. His granddaughters call them “Baba’s tacos.” Over a half-century later,\nthey carry on a treasured tradition that started here on the streets of D.F.\nIt starts with a boy being taught the history of the Olmecs, Mayans, Toltecs and Aztecs; of the\nGrito de Dolores of Don Miguel Hidalgo—the real “Zorro”; and of La Reforma of Don Benito\nJuárez.\nIt starts with a boy who spent Saturdays at las charreadas, cruised the then-clean waters of\nXochimilco, water skied on Lake Tequesquitengo, and whose mother took him on Sundays to La\nVilla to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It starts with a boy laughing at Cantinflas and\nweeping for Marcelino Pan y Vino.\nIt starts with a boy playing Little League baseball for los Tigres and later, los Leones, coached\nby a man named Norman Borlaug. On weekends, Mr. Borlaug would take that wide-eyed boy on\ntractor rides through corn and wheat fields, where at the end of the day they would eat paletas\nwhile the coach analyzed samples from the fields. Those samples became the basis for the Green\nRevolution that he started in Mexico and that ended up feeding billions of people around the\nworld.\nWell, I think by now you know that the boy I’m speaking of is me. I may be the only central\nbanker on the planet whose Little League baseball coach went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize!\nMy fondest childhood memories are from Mexico. Small wonder that I delighted when President\nClinton asked me to become deputy U.S. trade representative and help implement NAFTA—\neven if it meant matching wits with formidable negotiators like Luis de la Calle and Herminio\nBlanco!\nSmall wonder that as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I have delighted in\nworking closely with Guillermo Ortiz and Agustín Carstens. Small wonder that at meetings of\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or in U.S. banking circles, I have often argued Mexico’s\n1\n\n\fcase. Or taken sheer pleasure in pointing out to U.S. congressmen and senators, and in speeches\nand media interviews, that the Mexican government—unlike my own government—actually can\nagree on a budget, keep deficits under control, bring about structural change and resist interfering\nwith the workings of an independent central bank.\nI am full of pride for Mexico. I am full of pride that this country, the country of my happiest\nchildhood years, would now choose to honor me with the Order of the Aztec Eagle.\nThe citation for this honor speaks of my being a fierce defender of price stability. In the parlance\nof central banking, I am referred to as a “hawk.” Well, it may not surprise you to learn that\ntaxonomists place the eagle and the hawk in the same bird family. So, Secretary Meade,\nSecretary Videgaray and dear friend Agustín, I accept this thoughtful honor from the president of\nthe country I love so much with hawkish pride and close kinship to the golden eagle that is the\nsymbol of Mexico.\n¡Viva México!\nThank you.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew York City\nFebruary 11, 2015\n\n1\n\n\fSuggestions After a Decade at the Fed\n(With Reference to Paul Volcker, Roosa Boys, Hogwarts, the Death Star,\nEbenezer Scrooge, Mae West, Herb Kelleher, Worms and Camels,\nPeter Weir, Charles Kindleberger, Pope Francis and Secretariat)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am grateful to be invited to speak to the Economic Club of New York on the eve of my\nretirement from 10 years of service as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. I have sat\nthrough 78 regular meetings and an additional 18 special meetings of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) for a total of 96 meetings under three Fed Chairs over the past decade.\nGiven what we went through during the crisis and the healing we have tried to engineer in its\naftermath, I would argue you ought to measure the life of a Fed policymaker in dog years. This\nmorning, I thought I might offer some suggestions based upon those 70 years of experience.\nRoosa Boys\nBefore doing so, let me say I am tremendously honored to be introduced by Paul Volcker. Paul\nand I share a common heritage: We were both mentored by the late, great Robert V. Roosa. We\nare two of the “Roosa Boys,” the men—and women—Bob Roosa took under his wing every few\nyears to teach real-world economics and a love for policy. Paul was “Class of ’47” in the Roosa\n“school”; I was ’75. Of course, none of the successive Roosa Boys (and Girls) could ever match\nthe original standard, as is sometimes said about our nation’s presidency. I consider Paul to be\nthe George Washington of monetary policy—the very exemplar of the leadership and integrity\nand dedication that needs to be the inviolable hallmark of every central banker who follows in\nhis footsteps.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, prudent monetary policy gave way to political expedience\nbefore the quick-and-easy approach was reined in by Paul. Were it not for his insistence that the\nFed do what was politically unpopular, we would have seen our nation and the world destroyed\nby hyperinflation. Please join me in applauding Paul for his selfless service to our great country.\nHogwarts, the Death Star and Ebenezer Scrooge\nPaul Volcker stood his ground on the principle that monetary policy should never be politicized.\nWhich brings me to the first message I wish to impart today: that of the overriding importance of\nmaintaining an independent Fed.\nI recently came across a little volume by John Lanchester, titled How to Speak Money. In\ndescribing the Bank of England, Lanchester writes: “There’s a lot of ritual and ceremony and\nprotocol at the Bank, which to outsiders seems a cross between Hogwarts, the Death Star, and\nthe office of Ebenezer Scrooge.”1 The same can be said of the Federal Reserve, at least by those\nwho don’t take the time to read the copious amounts of reports and speeches and explanations\n2\n\n\fthe 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors continuously emit. It is always\npolitically convenient to make something sound mysterious, if not malevolent, by claiming it is\nopaque.\nWhich is precisely what is happening now with Senate Bill 264: the Federal Reserve\nTransparency Act of 2015 and its call to “audit the Fed.” The operations and finances of the\nBoard of Governors and the 12 Federal Reserve banks are already audited up the wazoo. As to\npolicy, as soon as our deliberations at the FOMC conclude, we report to the public what we\ndecided. We publish a thorough review of what we discussed—and all views are considered,\neven those of dissenters like Richard Fisher—in the form of minutes of every FOMC meeting\nthree weeks after we meet. And we subject our Chair to a no-holds-barred press conference on a\nquarterly basis. All of this alongside frequent speeches and press interviews by the 12 Federal\nReserve Bank presidents, who voice their independent views.\nMy suspicion is that many of those in Congress calling for “auditing” the Fed are really sheep in\nwolves’ clothing. Having proven themselves unable to cobble together with colleagues a\nworking fiscal policy or to construct a regulatory regime that incentivizes rather than discourages\ninvestment and job creation—in other words, failed at their own job—they simply find it\nconvenient to create a bogeyman out of an entity that does its job efficiently.\nI come from Texas. I hail from the land of Wright Patman and Henry B. Gonzalez. I am fully\naware of the appeal of Fed antipathy and the passion it can stir. It is nothing new. Close your\neyes when you hear a strident speech about auditing the Fed from one of the current bill’s\nauthors and you will hear echoes of radio broadcasts from the 1930s of Father Charles Coughlin,\npastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich. He railed passionately against the\n“money changers” and what he termed “the Federal Reserve banksters … and the rest of that\nundeserving group who without either the blood of patriotism or of Christianity flowing in their\nveins have shackled the lives of men and of nations ...”2 That’s powerful rhetoric.\nI am personally confident that responsible senior senators and congressmen like Sen. (Richard\nC.) Shelby of Alabama, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban\nAffairs, and Congressman (Jeb) Hensarling, the Texan who chairs the House Financial Services\nCommittee, can prevent any meddling with monetary policy while understanding the need for\ntheir colleagues to vent and score political points. And I find it hard to believe that wise and\nexperienced leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell would actually want the Fed’s policy\ndeliberations to be infected by politics. There is so much else to do under the purview of the\nSenate and the Congress to clean up the flotsam of fiscal policy and jetsam of regulatory\ninterference that is inhibiting job creation and economic expansion.\nBut we’ll see. Mae West put it best: “I generally avoid temptation unless I can’t resist it.” Even\nthe greatest political leaders have trouble resisting the temptation to fiddle with a central bank. If\n3\n\n\fyou read Liaquat Ahamed’s brilliant book, Lords of Finance, you’ll recall that German\nChancellor Bismarck’s closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, warned him “… that there would\nbe occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments\nand at such times too [politically] independent a central bank would be a nuisance.”3 We know\nthat when the German central bank gave into political considerations, the result was the Weimar\nhyperinflation and its eventual consequences. And that the Bank deutscher Länder, having\nestablished the principle of the independent central bank, which became the Bundesbank, was\ninstrumental in Germany’s rising from the ashes of World War II and becoming the economic\npillar of Europe.\nWho in this room isn’t grateful that Paul Volcker was a nuisance?\n“Audit the Fed” is nothing more than an attempt to override purely economic judgments and\nbend monetary policy to the will of politicians. It is misguided. I pray we don’t go there. I can\nthink of nothing that would do more damage to our nation’s prosperity.\nWorms in Whiskey\nThat doesn’t mean we should be deaf to the drumbeat of concerns about the Fed.\nMy friend, former Sen. Sam Nunn, likes to tell the tale of a backwoods preacher who was\nalarmed at the drinking habits of one of his parishioners. So the preacher called the man in. He\nput two glasses in front of him, one filled with water and the other with whiskey. He then put a\nworm in the glass of water. It swam around merrily. He then lifted the worm and placed it into\nthe whiskey-filled glass. It sank to the bottom, dead. “Son, do you get the message?” the\npreacher asked. “Yes sir, I do,” the parishioner replied. “If I drink whiskey, I won’t get worms.”\nLike the parishioner, I don’t think the Fed is getting the message.\nFirst, in this era of social media and über-transparency, we at the Fed need to learn to speak\nEnglish, rather than “Fedspeak.” I have done my level best during my tenure at the Fed to speak\nplainly, always bearing in mind that when I speak as a Fed official, I am speaking to the\nAmerican people whom we serve, not to a small group of economists or just to the mavens of\nWall Street.\nThe best case of this I have experienced the past decade occurred in May 2012, when the Dallas\nFed board of directors traveled to a joint meeting with the board of the St. Louis Fed. The\nchairman of my board at the time was Herb Kelleher, the puckish, iconic founder of Southwest\nAirlines. Of course, we flew to St. Louis on Southwest. True to form, after we reached cruising\naltitude, Herb took the microphone and said: “My name is Herb Kelleher, and I want to thank\nyou for flying on the airline I founded.” Herb is beloved by the people who fly Southwest;\nenthusiastic cheers and applause erupted from the passengers. Then he said, “Since I have a\n4\n\n\fcaptive audience, I want to tell you about the Federal Reserve. Today, you have on board one of\nthe most important people in the global financial system … me! Well, not really me, but I am\nchairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and with me is the Bank’s\npresident, who sits on the committee that decides the amount and the cost of your money.” He\nwent on to explain what the FOMC does and what the Fed banks do, how they are structured and\nso on, punctuating his remarks with references to Wild Turkey Bourbon and other personal\nfavorites.\nYou know the kind of folks who fly Southwest. They range from people dressed like you and me\nin suits and ties to work-by-the-sweat-of-your-brow folk dressed in bib overalls—like the one\nseated behind me with his wife. When Herb finished, again to a big round of applause and\nattaboys, the man behind me turned to his wife and said, “Ethel, if Herb Kelleher is involved\nwith the Federal Reserve, why did we vote for Ron Paul?”\nTie Your Camel\nSecond, I think we at the Fed must fully and frontally address the concern of many who feel that\ntoo much power is concentrated in the New York Fed. I am a great admirer of Bill Dudley. I\nconsider him a dear friend and a man of tremendous capacity both as a policymaker and as a\nregulator of the financial institutions in his district. And I have enormous respect for Simon\nPotter and the good women and men who work our trading desk, faithfully implementing the\ninstructions they receive from the FOMC, which crafts the nation’s monetary policy. Yet I\nunderstand the suspicions that surround the New York Fed.\nThere is an ancient Arab saying that one should “trust in Allah but tie your camel.” I would\nsuggest the following common-sense proposals for quelling concerns for securing our franchise\nas an independent Fed and, in fact, creating a more efficient policymaking and implementing\nprocess. Bill, you might not like these, but I think they are needed:\n1) We should rotate the vice chairmanship of the FOMC. Under the current structure, the\npresident of the New York Fed is the FOMC’s permanent vice chair, which renders him the\nsecond-most-powerful person at the table, behind the Chair. The purpose of the FOMC is to\ndecide policy and to instruct the New York trading desk to implement it by managing the\nFed’s System Open Market Account and short-term trading operations. Having the New\nYork Fed president as the FOMC’s vice chair gives the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nTo correct this, I would rotate that position every two years to one of the other 11 Fed\npresidents.\nWe have a convenient mechanism for doing so: The 12 Fed presidents meet frequently to\ndiscuss operational matters under the Conference of Presidents. Remember, there are no\noperating entities at the Board of Governors in Washington; it is the 12 Banks that lend\nmoney through their discount windows, house the forces that examine banks, operate the\n5\n\n\fvaults that keep safe the people’s cash, and so on. The Conference of Presidents rotates its\nchair among the presidents on a biennial basis. So I would simply have the chairman of the\nConference of Presidents automatically become vice chair of the FOMC. This way, over the\ncourse of two years, the Federal Reserve representatives of all 50 states (and all\ncongressional districts) would occupy the second-most-important slot on the FOMC, and any\nappearance of conflicted interest would disappear.\n2) With regard to regulation, the greatest concern appears to be the problem of regulatory\ncapture by the largest and most powerful institutions, the so-called Systemically Important\nFinancial Institutions, or SIFIs. We have instituted at the Board of Governors a powerful and,\nto my mind, extremely able and disciplined leader on regulatory matters, Governor Dan\nTarullo. But if that alone proves unsatisfactory to the Congress, a simple solution would be to\nhave each of the SIFIs supervised and regulated by Federal Reserve Bank staff from a district\nother than the one in which the SIFI is headquartered. Each of the Fed Banks has an able\nbody of examiners. With a tough central disciplinary authority in Washington dispatching\nthose troops to districts where SIFIs are concentrated, we might eliminate any perception of\nconflicted interest and, again, assure that regulators from all 12 Federal Reserve districts,\nrather than from just two cities, are deployed in maintaining the safety and soundness of our\nbanking system.\nThose are the two suggestions I thought would be most offensive to this New York audience!\nAnd I have a third and fourth:\n3) I would give the Federal Reserve Bank presidents an equal number of votes as the\nWashington-based governors, save the Chair.\nPresently, the New York Fed gets a permanent vote and the remaining 11 Banks get four\nvotes, with Cleveland and Chicago voting every two years and the rest voting every three\nyears. This makes no sense to me. The population of the New York Federal Reserve district\nis smaller than that of the San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond and Dallas districts.\nThe Cleveland district is much smaller than New York’s, roughly equal to that of Kansas\nCity, and only slightly larger than that of St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia—each of which\nhas 6 percent or less of the country’s population. (Minneapolis is the smallest district, with\nfewer than 3 percent of the nation’s population and roughly 1 percent of the Federal\nReserve’s deposits.)\nAnd if you look at population growth, it is clear that the districts that get to vote most often\nare not the ones that are growing but the regions that were most prominent generations ago.\nSince 1970, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s district has grown in population by less\nthan 7 percent, New York’s by 9 percent and Chicago’s by 18 percent. At the other end of the\n6\n\n\fspectrum, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ district has grown by 123 percent, San\nFrancisco’s by 112 percent, Atlanta’s by 105 percent and Richmond’s by almost 70 percent.\nThe current voting schedule makes no sense to me. But I wouldn’t necessarily change it\nsimply to avenge the past. I would change it to balance out the division of power between the\nFederal Reserve Banks that are out in the field and among the people and businesses that\noperate our economy and have their own independent research staffs, and the Board of\nGovernors, which is Beltway bound geographically and is briefed and guided by a single\nstaff. I have great admiration for the brilliance and integrity of the members of the Board of\nGovernors research staff. But you will notice that for at least a couple of decades, the\ngovernors have tended to vote in a block, and it brings to mind Peter Weir’s romantic\ncomedy Green Card, where the character played by Gerard Depardieu chastises the woman\nplayed by Andie MacDowell, saying, “You get all your opinions from the same place.” The\nmembers of the Board get their opinions from the same staff; the Fed bankers who sit at the\nFOMC table get theirs from 12 disparate staffs of the same high quality as that which resides\nin Washington.\nI would give six Banks the vote to match the six governors other than the Chair. The next\nyear, the other six would have the vote. The Chair would then be the tiebreaker if a tie were\nto ensue, though given the collegial way in which we conduct our deliberations, my guess is\nthat a tiebreaker would be a rarity. Thus, over a two-year stretch, all 50 states and all\ncongressional districts would have someone representing their constituents sitting as a voter\nat the table. Every year, six Fed Banks whose presidents serve under boards of directors\nchosen from within the states in their districts would match wits with Fed governors\nappointed by presidents and approved by Congress, providing a balance between what some\nmight consider representatives of Main Street and Washington factotums. To me, this is\neminently sensible.\n4) Fourth and finally, I would have the Chair hold a press conference after every FOMC\nmeeting. I have long advocated this. Presently, the Chair holds a press conference every\nquarter. In effect, this means that any change in monetary policy can be made only at a\nquarter’s end. (For if we were to suddenly announce that in between quarter ‘X’ and quarter\n‘Y’ the Chair was going to hold a press conference, it might spook and destabilize the\nmarkets). In the parlance of economics, this injects some time-dependency into our\ndeliberations when we should be guided in making policy strictly by the state of the\neconomy, and take action on monetary policy when it is needed. I believe the Chair should\nhold a press conference after every meeting to explain the whys and wherefores of the policy\ndecision taken by the committee. This would both add transparency and give the FOMC\ngreater leeway in implementing policy. For the record, I have been arguing for this for years\nnow.\n\n7\n\n\fMonetary Alzheimer’s\nIn the interest of time, I am going to make some additional, abbreviated suggestions, based on\nmy decade at the Fed.\nPolicymakers must be rigorous in their analysis but must be guided by common sense. We have\ndeveloped very sophisticated models of the economy at the Fed, and they are useful in providing\na framework for deliberation. Yet they are always at risk of becoming stale or inappropriate to\nthe situation. My advice is to heed Charles Kindleberger’s warning that “different circumstances\ncall for different prescriptions.” “The art of economics,” he said, “is to choose the right model\nfor the given problem, and to abandon it when the problem changes shape.”4\nRight now, we are trying to understand the dynamics of inflation. We have declared a 2 percent\nintermediate target for inflation, which seems to be standard for most central banks. Headline\ninflation measures show a significant shortfall from that target. The headline personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.2 percent in December. Its 12-month increase\nwas 0.75 percent, down from 1.6 percent in June. Should this low, and still falling, rate of price\ninflation retard the date of the liftoff from the zero-interest-rate policy we have been operating\nfor more than six years?\nI think not. We all know that headline inflation is being held down by the big decline in energy\nprices that began in the second half of 2014. We know that once energy prices stabilize, headline\ninflation is likely to bounce right back up. Policy needs to take past inflation into account, but it\nneeds to take future inflation into account, too. That’s just another way of saying that, for policy\npurposes, it’s inflation’s medium-term trend that matters—which is why analysts and\npolicymakers pay so much attention to core inflation measures. The widely heralded FRB/US\nmodel that has been used by the Board of Governors staff since 1996 is an example: It is built\naround PCE inflation excluding food and energy—which is the traditional measure of core\ninflation. Ex-food-and-energy PCE inflation was essentially zero in December, month over\nmonth, while the 12-month rate slipped to 1.3 percent from 1.5 percent in June.\nHere’s where that Kindleberger quote is relevant. A good core inflation measure strips the noise\nout of headline inflation and leaves the signal. By that standard, recent analysis shows that the\nex-food-and-energy PCE inflation rate that drives the FRB/US inflation forecast is a second-rate\ncore inflation measure, at best. An alternative measure developed at the Dallas Fed—the\nTrimmed Mean PCE—is superior in three respects.\nFirst, trimmed mean inflation is better insulated from transitory energy-price swings. Since 1994\n(the start of the current 2 percent-inflation era), conventional core inflation’s correlation with\nchanges in the real price of oil is 0.26, while trimmed mean inflation’s correlation is just 0.05.\n\n8\n\n\fSecond, as judged by root-mean-square error (sorry, but I do have to drop a little Fedspeak\neconomic jargon here), it is more closely aligned with intuitive, direct measures of trend headline\ninflation—like the 36-month centered average, or headline inflation’s average over the coming\n24-month period—that we are only able to observe after the fact.5\nThird, trimmed mean inflation has shown substantially less systematic bias. Over the past 10\nyears, looking only at data that would have been available to policymakers in real time,\nconventional core PCE inflation has averaged 1.65 percent—nearly 30 basis points below\nheadline inflation’s 1.94 percent average. Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation has come in at\n1.83 percent—just 10 basis points below headline. Setting policy using conventional core as your\nguide is like navigating using a compass: It has a systematic bias and is influenced by local\nanomalies in the Earth’s magnetic field. Using the trimmed mean to set policy is more akin to\nnavigating by GPS.\nIf you go to the Dallas Fed website, you will see our most recent posting: The 12-month trimmed\nmean rate held steady in December, staying within the 1.6 to 1.7 percent range it’s occupied\nevery month since April 2014. That’s a lower range than we’re shooting for, but a whole lot less\ndiscouraging than an inflation reading of 0.75 percent or even 1.3 percent.\nUnemployment trends give us additional reason not to be overly concerned about the current\ninflation shortfall.\nRecently, Pope Francis gave a stern lecture to the College of Cardinals about the risks of what he\ntermed “spiritual Alzheimer’s.” I worry that the FOMC, preoccupied with its 2 percent inflation\ntarget and understandably shy about moving too soon to lift off from the “zero bound,” is at risk\nof “monetary Alzheimer’s.”\nMy chief policy advisor, Evan Koenig, and I, and our Dallas research colleagues Anil Kumar and\nPia Orrenius have authored papers that show the Phillips curve—the relationship between\nunemployment and wage growth—is not linear but convex, meaning that wage growth initially\npicks up slowly in response to unemployment rate declines, but as you approach maximum\nemployment, inflation turns upward with increasing intensity. Up to now, we’ve been in picksup-slowly territory, with wage and salary inflation rising 0.2 percentage points each year, from\n1.5 percent in 2011, to 1.7 percent in 2012, to 1.9 percent in 2013 and to 2.1 percent in 2014. But\nif historical patterns hold, we’ll see larger and larger increments to wage inflation going forward.\nInflation responds to slack with a long lag in today’s world, where—thanks greatly to the efforts\nof Paul Volcker—confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability is\nstrong. It’s easy for policymakers to take that confidence for granted, and understandable that\nthey would want to push hard against real resource constraints in an effort to spread prosperity\nmore broadly. However, as I have repeatedly reminded my FOMC colleagues, every single time\n9\n\n\fthe Fed has waited for full employment to be achieved before starting to withdraw\naccommodation, it has ended up driving the economy into recession. When policymakers get too\nclever by half, the public pays a steep price.\nI liken monetary policy to piloting a ship, as I learned to do at the Naval Academy. When you\nare at the conn—at the wheel of a large ship—you begin to slow down miles before you reach\nyour intended destination. There are no brakes you can slam on to make a sudden stop. Ship\nvelocity, like monetary policy, operates with a lag. If we wait to see the whites of the eyes of full\nemployment and then have to raise rates sharply, I believe it will shock the economy and invite\nan adverse reaction. So, taking a page from Pope Francis, I hope we don’t forget the past and\nwill remember that the wisest policy option has proven to be early and gentle interest rate\nincreases as we approach full employment.\nSecretariat\nDuring the financial crisis, I said we were “the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” The\noutlook was bleak everywhere, and we were hobbling along on unsure legs. Now, thanks in part\nto accommodative monetary policy and the indestructible force of American entrepreneurialism,\nmost vividly demonstrated by George Mitchell and other innovators in the energy sector, and\nwith no thanks to fiscal and regulatory shenanigans by a feckless Congress and White House, the\nU.S. economy is now racing down the track.\nOur businesses used the downturn to tighten their expense structures and ramp up productivity\nand efficiency. They have used the accommodative monetary policy of the Fed and the\nabnormally low interest rates the Fed has engineered to clean up their balance sheets, replacing\nexisting debt with lower-cost debt and also tightening up their equity structures, buying back\nshares and improving shareholder satisfaction by paying out higher dividends. During the depth\nof the crisis, one of my most esteemed colleagues on the FOMC noted that, looking at our banks’\nbalance sheets, “nothing on the right was right and nothing on the left was left.” Now both sides\nof the balance sheets of most U.S. companies, as well as banks, are healthier than they have been\nin decades.\nHere is the point: Thanks to the Fed’s monetary policy and to their own ingenuity, private\nbusinesses in the U.S.A.—those that create real, lasting jobs—are well-groomed and fit and\nready to run faster around the global track than the businesses of any other country.\nSo let me conclude with the visual that I believe embodies the potential of our economy: that of\nSecretariat at the Belmont Stakes in 1973. And let me remind you that despite all the naysayers\nand doomsayers—those who said Europe would lap America, that Japan would lap America, that\nChina would lap America, that the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) would lap America,\nthat America could not compete with the masses of low-cost labor that were unleashed in China\nand India and elsewhere by the end of the Cold War and with the advent of globalization—we\n10\n\n\fare No. 1. The U.S. and its North American Free Trade Agreement partners, Mexico and Canada,\nform the most dynamic growth region of the world. We are Secretariat, and we can win the\nglobal economic race by 31 lengths if only we are given freer rein by fiscal and regulatory\nauthorities.\nG-6 to Gee Whiz\nI was a child of the Cold War. We lived then under the threat of mutually assured destruction.\nThe Wall came down. The Soviet Union disintegrated. Mao died. Communism was swept into\nthe dustbin of history. Sure, we have the group formerly known as ISIS and the Taliban and\nother perpetrators of evil. But the great powers have turned from mutually assured destruction to\nmutually assured competition. When I was sent by Bob Roosa to work in the Carter\nadministration and learn, in his words, “how government can screw things up,” we had a G-6—\nourselves and five nations that we interfaced with economically: Canada, England, France, Italy\nand Germany. Now we have a Gee Whiz. There is a G-20, a G-30, a World Trade Organization\nand so on. We won! Every nation wants in on the economic prosperity; every nation wants to\ncompete to better the living standards of its people.\nWe paid with precious blood and treasure to win the Cold War and create a world of mutually\nassured competition. And there is no country, no people, nobody anywhere on this planet who\ncan outpace us. Nobody. Period.\nThank you.\nAnd now, in the spirit of what every signatory to S. 264 worries about, I’d be happy to avoid\nanswering your questions.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nHow to Speak Money, by John Lanchester, New York and London: W.W.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 3, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Monetary Policy and an Annual Texas Economic Review\nBy Richard W. Fisher\nThank you, Alden [McCall]. I feel right at home in a room full of MBAs. As many of you know,\nI am not a PhD economist like the majority of my colleagues sitting on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC). I admire my colleagues tremendously for their intellectual capacity and\ntheir well-trained insights into the dismal science of economics and the arcana of monetary\npolicy, but I am proud of just being an MBA. I was privileged to attend all those schools Alden\nmentioned: the Naval Academy, Harvard and Oxford. But I feel that the MBA program at\nStanford Business School prepared me best for my career as a banker, a money market operator,\nand for the past decade, a policymaker at the Federal Reserve. (Though plebe year at Annapolis\nprobably best equipped me for the sleep deprivation and the pressure we operated under during\nthe financial crisis). So Alden, I begin with a tip of the hat to the MBAs you have assembled this\nevening.\nI am going to talk about Texas tonight, this being my annual report on the status of the Texas\neconomy. I will walk you through a series of slides that illustrate the strength of the Texas\neconomy, a series of economic records we have set this year, and to provide a balanced view,\nsome of the growing pains that we are encountering. But first, I want to make a comment on\nmonetary policy.\n\nThinking Outside the Box\nIt strikes me as timely for the Fed to consider implementing one of the possible options under the\n“normalization principles” the FOMC articulated in September: allowing our security holdings to\nrun off as the bonds in our massive portfolio mature.1 Before you jump out of your skin at this\n“radical” thought, let me ask you to consider the following.\nThe 10-year Treasury note has rallied in price and declined in yield to 2.29 percent. German 10year bunds, the equivalent market-anchoring European security, are trading to yield 0.74 percent;\nthe Japanese 10-year yields 0.42 percent. The spread between the U.S. and the German sovereign\nyields is slightly narrower than it was at the end of third quarter 2014, but it remains historically\nlarge and attractive for investors.2 Hold that thought.\nNow, if you read page C3 of today’s Wall Street Journal, specifically the article titled\n“Watchdog Warns of Risks in Markets” about the risks of a repeat of the bond market turmoil of\nOctober and concerns about market stability as seen through the eyes of the Office of Financial\nResearch (a bureaucracy of some 225 people and growing, created by the Dodd-Frank law), you\nwould have noted the following sentences: “A reduction in securities that are available to lend\nagainst in financial markets—such as Treasury bonds and asset-backed securities—also is\nfueling...volatility. The securitization markets have shrunk since the financial crisis and the\n1\n\n\fFederal Reserve has further reduced the amount of available securities by snapping up trillions of\ndollars in bonds in recent years.” Let me repeat that last clause: The Federal Reserve has further\nreduced the amount of available securities by snapping up trillions of dollars in bonds in recent\nyears. To be precise, $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and asset-backed securities were purchased under\nQE3, on top of the $2 trillion purchased under the previous rounds of quantitative easing.\nTo be sure, we have instituted programs to counter this problem: We have developed\nsophisticated operations whereby we sell assets in our portfolio and promise to buy them back at\na later period. This is known as our overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility,\nand its net effect is to shift longer-term securities out of our portfolio and into the hands of\nmarket operators. This has expanded the traditional reach of our New York desk, where the\naggregate portfolios of the 12 Federal Reserve banks are traded under directives given it by the\nFOMC. Thus the Fed's reach—some would say intrusion—into trading markets has been\nexpanded.\nNow, let's bring together these observations with the thought I asked you to hold earlier. It\nstrikes me that given current circumstances, it would do no harm to start slowly trimming our\nholdings by letting them roll off as they mature. My sense is that presently, we could do this:\n(a) While still maintaining the attractiveness of investing in Treasury and agency\nsecurities relative to other highly liquid sovereign markets and not sparking\nsignificant increases in rates;\n(b) Simultaneously providing some alleviation of the collateral shortage we have\nhelped create, and;\n(c) Reducing the need for the New York desk to perform the complicated jujitsu we at\nthe FOMC have tasked it with in creating alternative strategies that stretch its\ntraditional mandate and which may give further rise to congressional criticism of the\nFederal Reserve and a New York Fed that some influential lawmakers already\nconsider to be either too big for its britches or not being able to fill out its suit. This\nwould make crystal clear to Congress and the public our stated desire to make the ON\nRRP facility a temporary one that will be eliminated when it is no longer necessary.\nMind you, the above proposition does not imply any rush to raise the fed funds rate or its\nequivalents, such as the rate on excess reserves. That will depend on progress made toward\nmeeting our dual objectives of maintaining price stability around the FOMC’s 2 percent target\nwhile facilitating full employment. Nor should it be interpreted as a criticism of the very able\npeople we have on the trading desk: I hold them in highest regard; they perform their duty\nadmirably. It simply is addressed at seizing the moment to kill three birds with one stone and do\nso with minimum violence to the market.\n2\n\n\fOf course, a more effective way to put collateral back into the market would be to sell outright a\ncarefully measured portion of our portfolio. There could even be room for the market to stomach\nthis in its current condition. But in my opinion, this might be too radical a departure from the exit\nprinciples we announced and would risk undermining confidence in the FOMC.\nThis is my personal view. I realize it represents thinking “outside the box.” But in my final four\nmonths at the Fed, I plan to urge my colleagues to think more outside the box in this and other\nways in the interest of securing sound money, a sound economy and sound markets.\nAnd now to some Texas brag.\nTexas Brag\nAllow me to walk you through some charts and comment on each on them.\n\n$1,530,000,000,000\n2013 Texas Economic Output\n\n3\n\n\fSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis; International Monetary Fund (nominal, not PPP-adjusted); American\nEnterprise Institute’s Carpe Diem blog, post by Mark J.

Since January 2013, the yield spread has widened by 110 basis points to about 1.50 percent.\nOver the same period, German 10-year inflation expectations have dropped from 1.9 percent to 1.0\npercent, or 90 basis points. U.S. 10-year CPI inflation expectations have dropped from 2.3 percent to 2.2\npercent—just 10 basis points. So it is worth noting that the drop in German inflation expectations relative\nto U.S. expectations can account for most of the widening of the yield spread between these two\nsovereigns. For investors who measure performance in terms of nominal returns or returns against\nnominal indexes, however, the currently widened spread is relatively attractive.\n\n12\n\n\f"

QE3 … Or Will It?\n(With Reference to Shakespeare, Betsy Duke, Janet Yellen,\nYogi Berra and Lenny Kravitz)\nBy Richard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Mickey [Levy], for that colorful introduction.\nUnless you have been living under a rock (and no one in this audience looks like a cave dweller),\nyou know that on Wednesday of last week, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) ended its program of purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS). Thus endeth QE3.\nMay it rest in peace.\nEffects and Efficacy of QE3\nUnder QE3, the FOMC directed the New York Fed’s trading desk to purchase a total of $1.7\ntrillion in longer-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, on top of the $2 trillion\ninvested in the first two rounds of quantitative easing. When we started the first tranche of asset\npurchases in late 2008, our balance sheet had footings of around $900 billion; as the third and\nfinal round of quantitative easing ends, our balance sheet has reached $4.5 trillion.\nThe initial impetus for MBS purchases was a wide gap between MBS and Treasury yields,\nsymptomatic of a dysfunctional mortgage-finance market. The Federal Reserve responded by\npurchasing $1.3 trillion in MBS and agency debt as part of QE1, the program of balance-sheet\nexpansion that ran from late 2008 through the spring of 2010. Holdings of MBS and agency debt\nwere then allowed to run off and by September 2011 had fallen to a little under $1 trillion.\nHoldings were stabilized at that level when proceeds from maturing agency securities and MBS\nbegan to be reinvested in MBS, starting October 2011.\nThe renewed expansion of MBS holdings that began in October 2012 as part of QE3 was\nmotivated less by any sense that the mortgage-finance market was dysfunctional than by the\nnotion that normal frictions in that market potentially provided monetary policy with leverage to\nstimulate the housing sector—and thus the economy as a whole—at a time when moretraditional policy tools had been exhausted. The FOMC majority pushed aside concerns that\nproviding targeted support to housing is more properly the province of fiscal policy, and voted to\nproceed. From the start of QE3 to its conclusion, the Fed’s portfolio of agency securities and\nMBS expanded by about $850 billion. In the latest version of its normalization principles,\nreleased this September, the FOMC indicated that it expects to reduce its holdings in future years\nprimarily through attrition.\n1\n\n\fWhat of the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term Treasury securities\nunder QE3? Fed purchases of longer-term Treasuries amount to nothing more than the\ntransformation of long-term Treasury obligations into short-term obligations of the Federal\nReserve. Essentially, long-term government obligations are transformed into short-term\ngovernment obligations. The government benefits from lower interest costs in the near term, but\nits future net revenues become more sensitive to future interest-rate increases. Government\nfinance problems are reduced today, at a cost of potential future problems. The larger bank\nreserves become, the greater is the government’s future interest-rate exposure.\nChairman Ben Bernanke famously said that “the problem with QE is that it works in practice, but\nit doesn’t work in theory”—QE3 seemed to succeed in pushing interest rates lower out along the\nyield curve, energizing the bond market and lowering the hurdle rate for discounting cash flows\nand earnings of companies whose shares traded in stock markets.1 This came, of course, at the\nexpense of savers who kept their money in the most basic of short-term investments. But this\nwas a cost that the committee felt was exceeded by the expected wealth effect.\nWell before last week’s FOMC meeting, it seemed to me that QE3’s effectiveness had waned\nwhile its current and potential future costs were mounting. I was thus an enthusiastic supporter of\nkilling the program.\nIndeed, I would rather we had never had QE3 in the first place. To this day, I feel that the costs\nof accumulating another $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and MBS will be shown to exceed the\nbenefits. And yet, as I have said on countless occasions, drawing on former Dallas Fed board\nChairman Herb Kelleher’s love for bourbon, once we had QE3 in place, I considered it unwise to\ngo directly from Wild Turkey to cold turkey for fear of getting the financial equivalent of\ndelirium tremens; indeed, we saw that with the “taper tantrum” the markets threw in May of\n2013. So I was an eager proponent of the tapering program the FOMC initiated in January of this\nyear.\nI want to be clear here. Especially at the beginning of QE3, when the nonsense term “QE\ninfinity” was being broadcast by otherwise responsible analysts, journalists and pundits, rates\ndipped to lows that helped creditworthy businesses bolster their balance sheets and strengthen\ntheir wherewithal for future expansion. Again, even if you were living under a rock, you know\nthat this gift of near-cost-free debt as measured in inflation- and tax-adjusted terms has thus far\nbeen used primarily to finance stock buybacks, increase dividends and fatten cash reserves, and\nrecently, finance mergers by the most creditworthy companies. For those with access to capital,\nit was a gift of free money to speculate with. (One wag—I believe it was me—quipped that there\nwas, indeed, a “positive wealth effect… the wealthy were affected most positively.”)\n\n2\n\n\fWe know that monetary policy acts with long and variable lags. That characterization applies, in\nspades, to the unorthodox policy we have pursued at the zero bound, in terms of achieving full\nemployment and hitting our 2 percent inflation target.\nTogether with the healthy rejuvenation of the balance sheets and equity prices of investment\ngrade companies, we have seen what I consider to be a manifestation of an indiscriminate reach\nfor yield, a revival of covenant-free lending, and an explosion of collateralized loan obligations\n(CLOs), pathologies that have proved harbingers of eventual financial turbulence.\nNoticeably affected by QE3 have been the nominal yield levels of subpar credits and their\nspreads relative to investment-grade issues. Some 40 percent of newly issued CCC credits have\nnegative cash flows.2 And yet “junk” bonds have been trading at or near record historic low\nyields both in absolute terms and as measured by spreads over investment-grade credits. I worry\nabout this as a risk that has been propagated by QE3, though I do not believe it is the Fed’s job to\nrescue reckless investors from the errors of their ways.\nThe stock market bottomed in March 2009 and had already more than doubled by the time we\ninitiated QE3. It has since risen by another 40 percent; equities have, all-in, tripled in price since\nthe lows of 2009. Only time will tell if stocks have risen to unsustainable heights and, if so, how\ndeep a correction might be needed to bring them back to sustainable valuations.\nThe Last FOMC\nI believe that the Fed should, in most circumstances, not directly concern itself with fluctuations\nin financial-asset prices. If the economy is strong, the securities markets will be propelled by that\nstrength. If the real economy is hearty, it can withstand reversions to the mean of junk bond or\nany other trading market and stock market corrections: It did so during the prolonged correction\nof 1962 and again in 1987. For this reason, as we approached our deliberations at last week’s\nFOMC, I saw no reason for the Fed to react to the heightened volatility that occurred in midOctober and strongly advised my colleagues that we should be wary of any action we might take\nat the FOMC that would lead investors to assume there is a “Yellen Put” hidden in our pocket.\nFor this would only encourage continued indiscriminate investing.\nI view the economy as becoming stronger. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed realize that the\ncurrent unemployment rate, at 5.9 percent as of September, is still somewhat above most\nestimates of the “natural,” or minimum-sustainable, rate of unemployment. But the gap between\nactual and “natural” unemployment has been rapidly shrinking and is now less than 1 percentage\npoint.\nSome commentators argue that the unemployment rate hasn’t been a reliable indicator of labormarket slack during the last five years. As evidence, these commentators point to subdued wage\ngrowth. We at the Dallas Fed have investigated the links between wage inflation and the\n3\n\n\funemployment rate using the aggregate data that are available for the U.S., and also using statelevel data. These investigations have led us to three main conclusions. First, wage growth\nresponds to the unemployment rate with a lag. That’s no mystery: Many employers adjust wage\nand salaries just once each year. Second, wage growth becomes increasingly sensitive to the\nunemployment rate as the unemployment rate reaches lower and lower levels. A drop in the\nunemployment rate from 9 percent to 8 percent may not do much for the negotiating leverage of\nthe typical worker. But the story is different when the unemployment rate drops from 6 percent\nto 5 percent or below, for example.\nFinally, taking these two factors into account, there’s been nothing at all unusual about the\nbehavior of wage growth over the period since the national unemployment rate peaked nearly\nfive years ago. We went through a deep recession. Coming out of a deep recession, it takes time\nfor the unemployment rate to reach levels where wage growth picks up noticeably. Wage growth\nwas about 1½ percent in both 2010 and 2011—not too surprising, given that the unemployment\nrate was 9.9 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and, at 9.6 percent, nearly as high in the final\nquarter of 2010. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen by a little less than 1 percentage\npoint each year, and wage growth has picked up by 0.2 percentage points each year. Three\nquarters into 2014, wage growth is already up another two-tenths, to 2.1 percent at an annual\nrate.\nThis pattern of rising wage growth is roughly what one would have expected judging by\nprerecession data.3 If anything, wage growth has been running a bit above what we should have\nexpected. This contradicts the view that the unemployment rate has understated labor-market\nslack.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has a target for price inflation, not wage inflation. The rate of\nwage inflation consistent with our 2 percent price-inflation target depends on secular trends in\nlabor productivity growth and in labor’s bargaining power—trends over which the Federal\nReserve has no control and about which it can only make informed guesses. Nevertheless, the\nDallas Fed’s study of the Phillips curve has an important lesson for Fed policymakers: If we keep\npushing on the accelerator pedal until wage growth matches the rate that we believe to be\nsustainable, we will likely have pushed too far and missed our exit. Because wage growth reacts\nto slack with a lag, it will continue to increase even after policy stimulus is removed. Because\nwage growth rises at an increasing rate the farther the unemployment rate declines, the overshoot\nis likely to be large.\nI liken monetary policy to duck hunting. If you want to bag a mallard, you don’t aim where the\nbird is at present, you aim ahead of its flight pattern. To me, the flight pattern of the economy is\nclearly toward increasing employment and inflation that is approaching our 2-percent target.\n\n4\n\n\fThus, I was encouraged by the wording we negotiated at the last FOMC meeting. I was pleased\nthat we dropped the reference to “significant” in describing the remaining labor-market slack and\nthat wording was included indicating we might well move to raise rates sooner than thus far\nassumed, should the economy proceed along the trajectory I think we are on. To me, this\nneutered the adjective “considerable” in stating the time frame under which we might act. This is\nwhy this particular hawk voted “yes” in support of the statement we released on Wednesday.\nNow to the Exit…\nOf course, I am concerned with what will happen to all the liquidity that remains in the system in\nthe aftermath of our QE programs. The depository institutions we transact with have put back to\nthe 12 Federal Reserve Banks some $2.7 trillion in excess reserves. “Excess” means they cannot\nfind better uses for that money than earning the 25 basis points (25/100ths of one percent per\nannum) we pay them until they can find creditworthy borrowers to lend to at significant\nmultiples of that amount. And considering that this $2.7 trillion represents perhaps as little as\none-fifth of the amount of ready liquidity in the U.S. financial system—that being held not just\non deposit at the Fed Banks but also by nonfinancial corporations, private equity funds, other\ninvestors and households—there is a lot of inflationary tinder available should the Fed\nmismanage its exit from the hyper-accommodative policy we have pursued and augmented with\nQE3.\nThus, only time will reveal the efficacy of the policy we have pursued and whether the risks that\nI and other observers (among them my mentor, Paul Volcker) fret over are as substantial, or\nwhether we have made much ado about nothing.\nMy former colleague, the wonderful ex-banker and much-admired Fed Governor Betsy Duke,\nwas quoted on Oct. 28 in The Washington Post as saying this about QE3: “It’s still important to\nsee what the ultimate costs are going to be. You can’t really judge those until it’s completely\nunwound.”4 Betsy is spot on.\nChanneling Shakespeare\nIn June of last year, I gave a speech in Toronto in which I likened the post-zero-bound monetary\npolicy to a Shakespearean drama with five acts, suggesting we were then in the last scene of the\nthird act of a play titled “The Grand Experiment in Modern Monetarism.”5 I posited we will not\nknow until the final act whether the play will end felicitously or otherwise.\nI thought I would update that analogy here today. Here is the CliffsNotes summary: The play\nopened with the great financial tempest of 2008–09, during which it appeared the ship of the\nmighty American economy would founder. A humble, once unassuming but suddenly daring\ncaptain named Ben Bernanke took firm control of the nation’s monetary helm in Act II, working\nwith his officers—the FOMC—to contrive innovative ways to keep the economy afloat by juryrigging monetary policy and adopting radical tactical maneuvers. These efforts succeeded in\n5\n\n\fsteering the ship of the economy away from the shoals of depression and deflation and into more\ntranquil waters.\nAct III began with a recovering economy heading on a more promising course. But the headway\nbeing made was substandard, hindered by the flotsam and jetsam of fiscal incompetence and\nrising fears of a new storm brewing in Europe. In an effort to propel the economy forward at a\nbetter clip, the FOMC commanded that unprecedented amounts of monetary fuel be provisioned\nfor the financial system through large-scale asset purchases, the proceeds of which were pumped\ninto the stores of banks.\nBut as Act IV began, the banks lingered in the wings rather than taking center stage. Rather than\nshovel their abundant means into their loan boilers, they were parsimonious and hoarded their\nfuel. Other members of the financial fleet, however, were heartened by the turn of events,\nespecially those who finance themselves through the issuance of stocks and bonds rather than\nthrough bank loans. They danced a happy jig while they decorated their balance sheets with\ncheaper debt and improved their margins and earnings per share through share buybacks. Slowly\nthey began to hire new workers, and the ship of the economy started gathering momentum to\nsteam along at an improved clip.\nAs Act IV came to an end, the FOMC evaluated the utility of its navigational tactics, and having\ntentatively decided that it was on course to its desired destination, began cutting back on the\namount of fuel it was pumping into the financial system. Initially, it fumbled the dialogue, but\neventually the articulation of its intention was accepted, if not applauded, by its audience.\nNow we have entered Act V. Not until the final scene will we know whether we have achieved\nthe auspicious outcome of arriving at the desired port of an economy that grows sufficiently to\nbring about full employment without giving rise to inflation. With Shakespeare, the most\npleasant plays typically end in marriage. The happy outcome to our economic predicament\nwould entail the marriage of sensible fiscal policy with prudent monetary policy, carrying the\nAmerican economy to new horizons, allowing the Fed to emerge a hero.\nOne can envision less-pleasant outcomes, however, some of them tragic. If, even after the midterm elections tomorrow, the fiscal authorities—Congress and the president—are unable to\nprovide tax, spending and regulatory incentives for job creators to use the cheap and abundant\ncapital the FOMC and other creditors have made available, the economy might once again find\nitself becalmed. In the speech I gave nearly four years ago to your sponsor, the Manhattan\nInstitute, I specifically said of the then new Congress: “For all the hoopla (surrounding it), it will\nprove to be nothing more than a case of putting old, rancid wine in new bottles.”6 Pray this does\nnot happen again. Should the FOMC then try to compensate for fiscal authorities’ inability to act\nby provisioning still more monetary fuel, it may risk an explosion of speculative excess, or\nworse: an eventual inflationary conflagration, the debasement of money and the ruination of our\n6\n\n\feconomy and lifestyle. Should this prove the outcome, the Fed will be transmogrified from hero\nto villain.\nTo thicken the plot, as Act V began, Captain Bernanke exited stage right and a new skipper\nentered stage left. I should say here that I advocated for this particular skipper. Janet Yellen,\nwhen she was just another member of the crew as a Fed governor, was pigeonholed as a “dove”\n(forgive the double-entendre; doves are, ornithologically speaking, part of the pigeon family) but\nhas proven herself in her role at the helm of the FOMC to be neither dove nor hawk. Rather, she\nis impressively balanced and fully aware, at least in my opinion, that her legacy will be whether\nshe can successfully complete Act V by realizing the Fed’s mandate to maintain price stability\nwhile providing the monetary means to achieve full employment.\nAll of which means that despite the mighty efforts of Captains Bernanke and Yellen and their\nofficers and crew, present company included, we do not know how “The Grand Experiment”\ndrama will end. We certainly all hope it proves an inspiring history, not a tragedy. But, we will\nnot know for some time. We will not know until the curtain drops on Act V.\nR.I.P?\nBetsy Duke had it right: Only when we have normalized monetary policy—only when the play is\ndone—will we know if QE3 rests in peace or comes back to haunt us. Only when it is done will\nwe know if “The Grand Experiment in Modern Monetarism” is a smash hit or a bomb or\nsomething in between.\nAs Yogi Berra said and Lenny Kravitz sang: “It ain’t over till it’s over.” But one thing I know for\nsure: This speech is over. Thank you for listening.\nAnd now, Mickey, time and patience permitting, I would be happy to avoid answering any\nquestions you and your colleagues might have.\nNotes\n1\n\n“A Conversation: The Fed Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,” a discussion with Federal Reserve\nChairman Ben Bernanke on the Fed’s 100th anniversary, Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., Jan.\n16, 2014.\n2\nSee “The Next Default Wave: Slow and Low,” in The HY Wire, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Sept.\n24, 2014.\n3\nThe following charts illustrate the recent acceleration in wage growth (Chart 1) and the relationship\nbetween rising wage growth and falling unemployment (Chart 2).

            "content": "Remarks upon Receiving the\nWoodrow Wilson Award for Public Service\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas\nSeptember 19, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks upon Receiving the\nWoodrow Wilson Award for Public Service\nRichard W. Fisher\nThat wonderful, hyperbolic video makes reference to my father, Les Fisher. His story helps put\nthis occasion in proper perspective.\nLast November, I was in Queensland, Australia, and stood in the very court where, 104 years\nago, just two months past his 5th birthday, he was sentenced to seven years in Westbrook\nReformatory for begging for food.\nHere is what the court minutes say:\n“Lengthy evidence was taken from which it appears that the child’s mother had deserted [him]\n… The [child] has been in the care of the father for several weeks; and at 4 a.m. on the 18th, the\nfather and child were found sleeping together under a sort of grated bridge or platform.” The\narresting officer testified, “I have never known [the father] to do any work. … I could see he was\nbegging. … For the past two months he has almost constantly had the little boy with him day and\nnight. I have heard complaints about the way the boy was treated. … The child was hungry.”\nWestbrook Reformatory was considered the most sadistic reformatory in Australia; many of the\nboys sentenced to Westbrook were either beaten to death or committed suicide or, if they\nsurvived, became hardened criminals. But my dad was spared. Two weeks after he arrived, the\nwarden received a letter from the Home Secretary’s Office remitting the unexpired portion of the\nsentence of a seven-year detention.\nHe was released to an orphanage, then doled out to a series of foster homes, one so cruel as to tie\nhim by his ankle at night to an outdoor post, waking him in the predawn hours to deliver milk by\nhorse-drawn carriage. He became an “apprentice”—a euphemism for something akin to\nindenture—in a tool shop, working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night.\nAt the age of 14, his teeth are so rotten they are replaced by false ones. Eventually, at the age of\n17, he is released to the care of a family who takes him by ship to South Africa, where he\nbecomes a bus driver, sells Hupmobile cars and, for the first time, makes money. He falls in love\nwith the daughter of a widowed Norwegian woman who cooks for a boarding house. They set\nsail for the Promised Land, America, only to discover that his record and lack of documentation\nmake him inadmissible as a permanent resident. He retreats to Tijuana, Mexico, where he\noutsmarts the bookies at the horse track and crisscrosses the border to sell cars for eight years\nbefore he is admitted for U.S. citizenship in 1947.\nHe then hires out to collect a payment in Shanghai for a chemical company. In Shanghai, his\nwife becomes pregnant with their third child; they leave Shanghai on the second-to-last ship to\nsail from China before Mao’s forces close the port. They dock in Los Angeles and he sets about\nworking countless jobs in countless places: He sells tools and silver in Mexico, airplanes in\n1\n\n\fIndonesia, used cars in Florida, men’s suits in New York and women’s undergarments in the\nCaribbean. He smokes 72 cigarettes a day until his mid-50s and enjoys liberal portions of Scotch\nwhiskey, but he lives to the ripe old age of 90 years before dying in Austin, Texas.\nBy now, everyone knows that the son who was “manufactured in China” is me, your honoree. In\none generation, a great shift occurred: from homeless to Harvard; from a brutal reformatory in\nQueensland to the great banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York; from being\ntied by the ankle at night in the yard behind a foster home to living in the tony neighborhood of\nHighland Park, Texas; from working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night\nto becoming president and CEO of a $180 billion Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee—a group of 19 that decides monetary policy for the world’s\nmost powerful economy. From abuse and derision and scorn to being praised in that beautiful\nvideo by Henry Kissinger, Janet Yellen, Admiral (Bobby R.) Inman, Ray Hunt, Herb Kelleher\nand Randall Stephenson and my fellow honoree and the chairman of the Dallas Fed Board, Mike\nUllman, one of the nicest men God ever put on this good earth.\nFrom sleeping under a bridge and begging for food to being here tonight at this sumptuous\ndinner to receive the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.\nWhat an honor! For me. For my father (and my mother). For my family.\nOnly in America could this be possible!\nI am deeply grateful. But I did not get here alone.\nTwo of the people who led me to tonight are in the audience. I want to ask them to stand up. The\nfirst is my eldest brother, Mike Fisher. Mike has had a distinguished career in institutional\ninvesting and just stepped down as chairman of the board of trustees of Bryant University. When\ntimes were tough for our family—and at times they were, especially when we moved back to the\nUnited States from Mexico and were flat broke—he was the one who paid the rent and put food\non our table. He is a hero. And so is the other man I want to ask to stand, my mentor: Paul\nVolcker. Paul is an example of principle, of putting the needs of the nation above political\nexpediency: He saved our country from economic destruction and has been an example to me\nsince I first met him back when I worked at Brown Brothers in the 1970s. Thank you, Mike and\nPaul, for showing me the way. (By the way, if you add together their height, you have a full 13\nfeet 2 inches of exemplary leadership: They are Big Men in more than a leadership sense.)\nOne last comment: I am proud of this honor, this recognition of “accomplishment.” But let me\nbrag on my greatest accomplishment: my children. I’d like to ask my son Anders to stand up.\nAnders, his sister Alison and brother James, who could not be here tonight, and their late sister\nTexana are the greatest accomplishments of my life. They clearly got their clever brains and\ngood looks and many talents from their mother. But tonight, I am going to take a wee bit of\ncredit for the remarkable people they have become and want them to know that as proud as I am\nto receive this award, I am proudest of all for just being their dad.\nThank you.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas\nSeptember 4, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Texas Jagannatha\n(With Reference to Indian Prime Minister Modi,\na Hindu Goddess and Wodehouse’s Big Money)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Ashok (Mago). I am so honored to have been invited to join Ambassador (S.)\nJaishankar this evening to celebrate the U.S.–India Chamber of Commerce and its many\ndistinguished awardees.\nMr. Ambassador, I am delighted you are here in Texas tonight. I am going to give you a few\nstatistics in a moment that I think will make readily apparent the reason for this large audience\nand why so many Indian entrepreneurs and professionals come to Texas. Then I am going to give\nyou a snapshot of where the U.S. economy is at present and what we are grappling with at the\nFed. But first, with your indulgence, I want to briefly speak of the relationship between our two\ngreat countries, India and the United States.\nTime to Enhance the U.S.–India Working Relationship\nThe logic of an enhanced strategic relationship between my country and yours is crystal clear,\nbeginning with a harsh geopolitical reality: You live in a tough neighborhood and need us; we, in\nturn, need all the friends we can muster in your geographic sphere. It seems very timely that we\novercome the history that has separated us and begin working more closely together.\nDuring the Cold War, it was the view of many in the United States that India was too closely\nallied with the Soviet Union. American businesses that looked at India found it afflicted with the\nlegacy of the worst of British bureaucratic administration. (The old joke was that you could\nnever get morning tee times at any Indian golf course because the bureaucrats had locked them\nup at least until noon).\nFrom an Indian perspective, America seemed too hegemonic. Attempts by U.S. companies to\ninvest and do business in your homeland revived memories of the East India Company.\nWe viewed each other through the lens of the time and against a background of our own\nhistories, with suspicion.\nBut the (Berlin) Wall came down, the economy has been globalized and cyberized, and new\nthreats to security have arisen, many of them from nonstate actors or forces who operate from\nwithin failed states to inflict damage elsewhere. This is a time for like-minded people to unite\nand work together.\n\n1\n\n\fWe are like-minded in that we are democracies. But tonight we celebrate something even more\nfundamental. My reading of India is that, like in the U.S., your country men and women are more\npragmatic and business-oriented than they are ideological or inherently bureaucratic.\nThe recent election of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi offers the promise of making this\nabundantly clear. He was, after all, the chief minister for over a decade of the Gujarat, the most\nprobusiness state in India. And almost every U.S. business leader I know has heard of Ratan\nTata’s experience when he looked to Gujarat for an alternative to the frustration of his attempt to\nbuild a new car factory in West Bengal. As I understand it, Mr. Tata went to see Minister Modi,\nhad a handshake deal in 30 minutes, and in 14 months the new factory was up and running. That\nalmost makes Texas look like California by comparison!\nSo Mr. Ambassador, we are all watching for this first prime minister born since Independence to\nwork his probusiness, nonbureaucratic, can-do spirit upon the whole of India. It is in America’s\ninterest for India to thrive. We wish Prime Minister Modi, the government you represent with\nsuch distinction, and the Indian nation the very best of luck.\nThe Texas Jagannatha\nTonight, you and I are surrounded by the smart, probusiness people of Indian heritage who have\nchosen to invest and operate within the most probusiness state in the United States.\nI am going to throw up a few slides to quickly summarize the environment in which they operate.\nTexas is a job-creating juggernaut. I pick that word deliberately, knowing it derives from the\nHindi Jagannatha and is, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a title of Krishna.\nSpecifically, it is: “the uncouth idol of this deity at Puri in Orissa, annually dragged in procession\non an enormous car,” crushing everything in its path. But Hindu or Muslim or whatever your\nfaith, while one might consider Texans to on occasion be uncouth, there is no denying that our\neconomy is an enormous job-creating car that enables and advances its devotees rather than\ncrushing them. A job is the road to dignity and to the prosperity of any people, and Texas has\nbecome the most prosperous of states.\nHere is a graph depicting job growth in Texas versus the other large states that typically have\ndrawn Indian and other investment and immigration:\n\n2\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment Since 1990\nin Selected Large States\nIncrease\nsince 1990\n\nIndex, January 1990 = 100\n170\n\nTX +66%\n160\n150\n\nFL +46%\n\n140\n130\n\nU.S.+27%\n\n120\n\nCA +24%\n\n110\n\nIL +11%\nNY +9%\nMI +6%\n\n100\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nFor over two decades, we have outperformed the rest of the United States in job creation by a\nfactor of more than 2 to 1. Over 23 years, only nine net new jobs have been created for every 100\nthat existed in New York in 1990, whereas in Texas, 66 jobs have been created.\nWe have been especially prolific in creating jobs since the Great Recession waylaid the world at\nthe end of 2007. Today, employment in Texas is 8.6 percent above its prerecession peak. The\nnation as a whole is 0.5 percent—zero point five percent—above its previous peak. However, if\nyou take Texas out of the U.S. economy, statistically speaking, you see that the U.S. ex-Texas\nstill has not caught up to its prerecession employment levels. Here is a graph that shows the\nmargin of difference in employment performance:\n\n3\n\n\fTexas Is Growing, Rest of U.S. Still Recovering\nCumulative change in employment since November 2007 (millions)\n\nTexas\n\n2\n\n+1.1 million jobs\n\n0\n\nU.S.\n\n-2\n\n-350,000 jobs\n\n-4\n\nWithout the 1.1 million jobs\ncreated in Texas, the nation\nwould still be 350,000 below\nthe prerecession peak\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\nNov-07\n\nJul-08\n\nMar-09\n\nNov-09\n\nJul-10\n\nMar-11\n\nNov-11\n\nJul-12\n\nMar-13\n\nNov-13\n\nJul-14\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; “Texas Is a Real Model for Economic Opportunity,” by Vance Ginn,\nInvestor’s Business Daily, Op-Ed, Aug. 21, 2014.\n\nAccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ payroll employment data, Texas has created 1,100,600\njobs since November 2007; the rest of America is still 349,600 jobs shy of the prior employment\npeak.\nTexas has been the crucible of job creation in America.\nMore than Oil and Gas; Jobs Well-Distributed\nIt is a common perception that the jobs that have been created here are primarily in the\nburgeoning energy sector. It is true that Texas is an energy powerhouse: We produce more than 3\nmillion barrels of oil and 21 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. To put this in perspective,\nTexas produces more oil than Kuwait or Venezuela or, if you’d like, more oil than the amount\nthe U.S. imports from the Middle East. With regard to natural gas, Texas produces more than all\n28 countries of the European Union combined.\nOf course, the energy sector is a significant driver for the Texas economy. Last year, the state\nsaw an increase of 16,100 jobs related to oil and gas extraction and associated support services.\nWe are grateful for every one of them. Yet there are seven other sectors of the Texas economy\nthat produced more jobs than the energy sector last year. Here is a graphic summary of where\njobs were created in the Lone Star State in 2013:\n\n4\n\n\f2013 Texas Job Gains by Sector\nThousands of jobs\n80\n\nTexas employment grew by 2.7% last\nyear, an increase of 294,500 jobs\n\n73.7\n\n70\n60\n50\n\n44.6\n\n42.3\n\n40\n\n33.5\n26.8\n\n30\n\n19.7\n\n20\n\n18.1\n\n16.1\n\n10\n\n5.5\n\n4.9\n\n0\nTrade, Transp\n& Utilities\n(20.1%)\n\nProf. &\nBusiness\nServices\n(13.1%)\n\nLeisure &\nHospitality\n(10.2%)\n\nEducational & Construction Government\nHealth\n(5.5%)\n(16.1%)\nServices\n(13.2%)\n\nFinancial\nActivities\n(6.1%)\n\nOil & Gas\nExtraction &\nMining\nSupport\n(2.5%)\n\nInformation Manufacturing\n(1.8%)\n(7.7%)\n\nNOTES: Numbers in parentheses are total share of Texas nonfarm employment accounted for by each sector.\nThese data are seasonally adjusted and early benchmarked by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Texas Workforce Commission; Dallas Fed.\n\nIn terms of number of jobs created, the leading sectors in Texas last year were trade,\ntransportation and utilities (accounting for 73,700), professional and business services (44,600),\nleisure and hospitality (42,300), educational and health services (33,500), construction (26,800),\ngovernment (19,700) and financial activities (18,100).\nThis year through July, Texas employment has already increased by 238,200 jobs, a 3.6 percent\nannualized growth pace. Over the 12 months ending this July, Texas added just shy of 400,000\njobs—more jobs than any other state. Clearly, Texas employment is growing at an impressive\nclip.\nAnother misperception is that all of these jobs created in Texas are low-paying jobs. Wrong. We\nhave been creating jobs in every income quartile, unlike the rest of the country. This graph,\nrecently updated, covers the 13-year period from 2000 to 2013.

At the Federal Open Market Committee, where we set\nmonetary policy for the nation, we have been working to better understand these employment\ndynamics. This is no easy task. Bill Gross, one of our country’s preeminent bond managers,\nmade a rather pungent comment about our efforts. He noted that President Harry Truman\n“wanted a one-armed economist, not the usual sort that analyzes every problem with ‘on the one\nhand, this, and on the other, that.’” Gross claimed that Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen, in her speech\ngiven recently at the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference, introduced so many qualifications\nabout the status of the labor market that “instead of the proverbial two-handed economist, she\nmore resembled a Hindu goddess with a half-dozen or more appendages.”2\nWhether you analyze the labor markets with one arm or two, or six or 19, the issue is how\nquickly we are approaching capacity utilization, so as to gauge price pressures. After all, a\ncentral bank is first and foremost charged with maintaining the purchasing power of its country’s\ncurrency. Like most central banks around the world, we view a 2 percent inflation rate as a\n7\n\n\fdecent intermediate-term target. Of late, the various inflation indexes have been beating around\nthis mark. Just this last Friday, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index for July was\nreleased, and it clocked in at a 1 percent annualized rate, a pace less than the run rate of April\nthrough June.\nDoes this mean we are experiencing an inflation rate that is less than acceptable? I wonder. At\nthe Dallas Fed, we calculate a trimmed mean inflation rate for personal consumption\nexpenditures to get what we think is the best sense of the underlying inflation rate for the normal\nconsumer. This means we trim out the most volatile price movements in the consumer basket to\nachieve the best sense we can of underlying price stability. In the July statistics, we saw some of\nthe fastest rates of increases in a while for the largest, least-volatile components of core services,\nsuch as rent and purchased meals.3 So the jury is out as to whether we have seen a reversal in the\nrecent upward ascent of prices toward our 2 percent target.\nAs to achieving “moderate interest rates,” the dashboard shows that we have overshot the mark.\nInterest rates on the lowest-quality credits—on “junk”—are historically low, as are the spreads\nthey are priced at above the current historically low nominal rates for investment-grade credits. I\nhave been involved with the credit markets since 1975. I have never seen such ebullient credit\nmarkets. The 30-year Treasury yield is trading at a hair over 3 percent. If Ambassador Jaishankar\nand I were to abandon our service to our respective nations and form a company, we would use\nour good names to borrow as much money as we could at current rates.\nAnd this, indeed, is happening. U.S. companies have used this bond market and borrowing rate\nhiatus from normalcy to pile up cheap, nearly cost-free balances. This cheap and abundant\nmonetary fuel, with the proper incentives from the fiscal and regulatory authorities, can be\ndeployed to the benefit of company stakeholders (shareholders and employees) to enrich and\ngrow the economy. In this sense, we are unique in the world.\nMr. Ambassador, American businesses are rich and muscular. And those muscles are being\nflexed. For example, just two days ago, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its\nPurchasing Managers Index. The data surprised most all forecasters to the upside. Activity was\nbroad based: 17 of 18 industries surveyed reported growth in August, and new orders reached a\n10-year high. Today, the ISM released its nonmanufacturing index, which registered the highest\nlevel in nine years. These reports echo a string of others—including the Beige Book survey of\nregional economic conditions released yesterday by the Federal Reserve—that underscore the\nhealing that is taking place in the U.S. economy despite our having what is, in truth, a\ndysfunctional and counterproductive fiscal and regulatory environment. All we need now is for\nthe fiscal and regulatory authorities—Congress and the executive branch—to unleash the animal\nspirit of business that is well nourished with the feed of cash and ready to roll.\n\n8\n\n\fWodehouse’s Perspective\nI happen to share a common bond with Indians: I have long been a reader of P.G. Wodehouse.4\nIn his book, Big Money, published in 1931, he has a wonderful passage in which a young lad\nnicknamed Biscuit describes the woman he has fallen in love with: “… when I think that a girl\ncan be such a ripper and at the same time so dashed rich, it restores my faith in the Providence\nwhich looks after good men.” Be it Providence or the Fed, the American business community is\nat present a “ripper”—it looks darned good—and is “dashed rich.” We are poised for a healthy,\nsustainable expansion. The men and women in this room see it in Texas. I trust they will see it in\nthe whole of the United States. And I trust they and others like them will use it to lead the world,\nincluding India, to expanded economic prosperity.\nThank you for having me here this evening.\nNotes\n1\n\nThe Fed’s policy objectives, as stated in Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act, are that “the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long\nrun growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to\nincrease production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and\nmoderate long-term interest rates.” See www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm.\n2\nSee “The Fed’s Evenhanded Policy,” by Randall W.

Fisher\nThank you Willow [Bay]. Willow is more than an accomplished journalist. She is a hallowed\nfigure in our family for having introduced my son Miles to his wife, Lucy. So, above and beyond\nWillow’s remarkable formal credentials, I am beholden to her. Her kind invitation to return to\nLA and the University of Southern California today was a command, and I snapped to it!\nLet me cut to the chase: I am increasingly concerned about the risks of our current monetary\npolicy. In a nutshell, my concerns are as follows:\nFirst, I believe we are experiencing financial excess that is of our own making. When money is\ndirt cheap and ubiquitous, it is in the nature of financial operators to reach for yield. There is a\nlot of talk about “macroprudential supervision” as a way to prevent financial excess from\ncreating financial instability. My view is that it has significant utility but is not a sufficient\npreventative. Macroprudential supervision is something of a Maginot Line: It can be\ncircumvented. Relying upon it to prevent financial instability provides an artificial sense of\nconfidence.\nSecond, I believe we are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our\nwelcome by staying too loose too long. We did a good job in staving off the deflationary and\ndepression risks that were present in the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial crisis. We now risk\nfalling into the trap of fighting the last war rather than the present challenge. The economy is\nreaching our desired destination faster than we imagined.\nThird, should we overstay our welcome, we risk not only doing damage to the economy but also\nbeing viewed as politically pliant.\nThe Rub\nWillow, to put all this in context, I was uncomfortable with QE3, the program whereby we\ncommitted to a sustained purchase of $85 billion per month of longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds\nand mortgage-backed securities (MBS). I considered QE3 to be overkill at the time, as our\nbalance sheet had already expanded from $900 billion to $2 trillion by the time we launched it,\nand financial markets had begun to lift off their bottom. I said so publicly and I argued\naccordingly in the inner temple of the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where\nwe determine monetary policy for the nation. I lost that argument. My learned colleagues felt the\nneed to buy protection from what they feared was a risk of deflation and a further downturn in\nthe economy. I accepted as a consolation prize the agreement, finally reached last December, to\n1\n\n\ftaper in graduated steps our large-scale asset purchases of Treasuries and MBS from $85 billion\na month to zero this coming October. I said so publicly at the very beginning of this year in my\ncapacity as a voting member of the FOMC. As we have been proceeding along these lines, I have\nnot felt the compulsion to say much, or cast a dissenting vote.\nHowever, given the rapidly improving employment picture, developments on the inflationary\nfront, and my own background as a banker and investment and hedge fund manager, I am finding\nmyself increasingly at odds with some of my respected colleagues at the policy table of the\nFederal Reserve as well as with the thinking of many notable economists.\nHere is the rub as I see it: The Fed as the nation’s monetary authority has been running a hyperaccommodative monetary policy in order to lift the economy out of the doldrums and counteract\na possible deflationary spiral. Starting six years ago, we embarked on a path to make money\ncostless and abundantly available. We did so in several stages that are by now well known,\nculminating by shifting into high gear with the aforementioned QE3 program whereby we have\nsince more than doubled the Fed’s balance sheet to $4.5 trillion.\nPreviously, we influenced financial markets and the economy by managing the federal funds\nrate, the overnight rate that anchors the yield curve. Presently, 75 percent of Federal Reserveheld loans and securities have remaining maturities in excess of five years, and we own roughly\n40 percent of the stock of U.S. Treasury bonds and a similar proportion of MBS. This is an\nunprecedented profile for the portfolio of the keeper of the watch for the global financial system.\nWhen we buy a Treasury note or bond or an MBS, we pay for it with reserves we create. This\ninjects liquidity into the economy. This liquidity can be used by financial intermediaries to lend\nto businesses to invest in job-creating capital expansion or by investors to finance the repairing\nof balance sheets at cheaper cost or on better terms, or for myriad other uses, including feeding\nspeculative flows into financial markets.\nMuch of what we have paid out to purchase Treasuries and MBS has been put back to the Fed in\nthe form of excess reserves deposited at the Federal Reserve Banks, such as the Dallas Fed. As\nof July 9, $2.517 trillion of excess reserves were parked on the 12 Fed Banks’ balance sheets,\nwhile depository institutions wait to find eager and worthy borrowers to lend to.\nBut with low interest rates and abundant availability of credit in the nondepository market, the\nbond markets and other trading markets have spawned an abundance of speculative activity.\nThere is no greater gift to a financial market operator—or anyone, for that matter—than free and\nabundant money. It reduces the cost of taking risk. But it also burns a hole in the proverbial\npocket. It enhances the appeal of things that might not otherwise look so comely. I have likened\nthe effect to that of strapping on what students here at USC and campuses elsewhere call “beer\ngoggles.” This phenomenon occurs when alcohol renders alluring what might otherwise appear\n2\n\n\fless clever or attractive. And this is, indeed, what has happened to stocks and bonds and other\nfinancial investments as a result of the free-flowing liquidity we at the Fed have poured down the\nthroat of the economy.\nLessons from Swift and Irwin\nAt the Fed, as with any great university like USC, there is a culture of citing serious academic\nstudies to document one’s thesis (especially if you are the lead or coauthor of the study!). You\nneedn’t be an academic economist, however, to understand the danger of too much money. A\nstudent of literature can cite Jonathan Swift and his “Poems,” written in 1735:\nMoney, the life-blood of the nation,\nCorrupts and stagnates in the veins,\nUnless a proper circulation\nIts motion and its heat maintains.\nAs evidenced by the buildup in excess bank reserves, the money we have printed has not been as\nproperly circulated as we had hoped. Too much of it has gone toward corrupting or, more\nappropriately stated, corrosive speculation.\nTo get a sense of some of the effects of excess liquidity, you need look no further than Neil\nIrwin’s front-page, above-the-fold article in the July 8 issue of the New York Times, titled “From\nStocks to Farmland, All’s Booming, or Bubbling.” “Welcome to … the Everything Bubble,” it\nreads. “Around the world, nearly every asset class is expensive by historical standards. Stocks\nand bonds; emerging markets and advanced economies; urban office towers and Iowa farmland;\nyou name it, and it is trading at prices that are high by historical standards relative to\nfundamentals.” Irwin’s comments bear heeding, although it may be difficult to disentangle how\nmuch these lofty valuations are distorted by the historically low “risk-free” interest rate that\nunderpins all financial asset valuations that we at the Fed have engineered.\nI spoke of this early in January, referencing various indicia of the effects on financial markets of\n“the intoxicating brew we (at the Fed) have been pouring.” In another speech, in March, I said\nthat “market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive” and noted\nthat “we must monitor these indicators very carefully so as to ensure that the ghost of ‘irrational\nexuberance’ does not haunt us again.” Then again in April, in a speech in Hong Kong, I listed the\nfollowing as possible signs of exuberance getting wilder still:\n\n\n\n\nThe price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratio for stocks was among the highest decile of reported\nvalues since 1881;\nThe market capitalization of U.S. stocks as a fraction of our economic output was at its\nhighest since the record set in 2000;\nMargin debt was setting historic highs;\n\n3\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\nJunk-bond yields were nearing record lows, and the spread between them and\ninvestment-grade yields, which were also near record low nominal levels, were ultranarrow;\nCovenant-lite lending was enjoying a dramatic renaissance;\nThe price of collectibles, always a sign of too much money chasing too few good\ninvestments, was arching skyward.\n\nI concluded then that “the former funds manager in me sees these as yellow lights. The central\nbanker in me is reminded of the mandate to safeguard financial stability.”1\nSince then, the valuation of a broad swath of financial assets has become even richer, or perhaps\nmore accurately stated, more careless. It is worrisome, for example, that covenant-lite lending\nhas continued its meteoric revival and has even surpassed its 2007 highs.\nMacroprudential Supervision: A Maginot Line?\nThere are some who believe that “macroprudential supervision” will safeguard us from financial\ninstability. I am more skeptical. Such supervision entails the vigilant monitoring of capital and\nliquidity ratios, tighter restrictions on bank practices and subjecting banks to stress tests.\nAlthough these macroprudential disciplines are important steps in reducing systemic risk, I also\nthink it is important to remember that this is not your grandparents’ financial system. The\nFederal Reserve and the banking supervisory authorities used to oversee the majority of the\ncredit system by regulating depository institutions; now, depository institutions account for no\nmore than 20 percent of the credit markets. So, yes, we have appropriately tightened the screws\non the depository institutions. But there is a legitimate question as to whether these safeguards\nrepresent no more than a financial Maginot Line, providing us with an artificial sense of\nconfidence.\nIf you look up “Maginot Line” in Wikipedia—the source of most of the world’s conventional\nwisdom—it notes that “… experts extolled the Maginot line as a work of genius.” It did prevent\nGermany from leading a direct attack on France during World War II. But it was ultimately\nineffective as the Germans outflanked it through neighboring Belgium. “Genius” proved\ninsufficient to thwart a determined force. Thus, the term “Maginot Line” is commonly used to\nconnote a strategy that clever people hoped would prove effective, but instead fails to do the job.\nWith this in mind, and given that our direct supervisory authority covers roughly only a fifth of\nthe credit system, the Dodd–Frank legislation called for the creation of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC). This committee composed of members from the Fed and other\nregulatory authorities is tasked with identifying and monitoring risks posed by so-called\nsystemically important financial institutions. These financial institutions—banks and nonbanks\nalike—are better known as “SIFIs,” an acronym that appropriately sounds like something you\n\n4\n\n\fmight get from wanton behavior. Just last week, Fed Vice Chair Stan Fischer spoke of the need\nto fortify the FSOC process. I agree with him that this is a sensible thing to do.\nAnd yet one has to consider the root cause of the “Everything Boom.” I believe the root cause is\nthe hyper-accommodative monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. This\nwas recently written about and documented at length in the annual report of the Bank for\nInternational Settlements, a report I highly recommend to you.2 The Fed and other central banks\nhave been the catalysts for a search for yield. Markets discount risk liberally if they are under the\nspell of a presumed central bank “put” that will diminish the risk of loss. They will continually\nseek a financial Belgium or some other venue to bypass the protective wall that macro-financial\nsupervision and oversight bodies such as the FSOC are believed to represent, however fortified.\nAn Adjustment to the Stance of Monetary Policy\nI am not alone in worrying about this. In her recent lecture at the International Monetary Fund,\nFed Chair Janet Yellen said, “I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten\nthe incentives of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the\nlimits of macroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns,”\nadding that “[a]ccordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be\nappropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability.”\nHere is the message: At some point you cross the line from reviving markets to becoming the\nbellows fanning the flames of the “Booming and Bubbling” that Neil Irwin writes about. I\nbelieve we have crossed that line. I believe we need an adjustment to the stance of monetary\npolicy.\nOur duty as the nation’s central bank is not to engineer a “put” to the markets. Our duty is\nmandated by Congress and the amendments it made under the Federal Reserve Act in 1977.\nSpecifically, the amended act states: “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nand the FOMC shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote\neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest\nrates.”\nTake It from Shakespeare’s Portia\nIn my opinion, we have certainly taken liberty with the definition of “moderate interest rates.”\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines “moderate” as “avoiding extremes.” And, aptly, it cites\namong the first uses of the adjective “moderate” Portia’s monologue in Shakespeare’s Merchant\nof Venice: “O love be moderate, allay thy ecstasy. In measure rain thy joy. Scant this excess. I\nfeel too much thy blessing. Make it less. For fear I surfeit.”3\n\n5\n\n\f“Joy,” “ecstasy,” “excess,” “surfeit,” “too much”: These words are certainly descriptive of the\ncurrent status of the credit, equity and other trading markets that have felt the blessing of nearzero cost of funds and the abundant rain of money made possible by the Fed and other central\nbanks that have followed in our footsteps.\nSome are willing to tolerate the consequences of the blessings that the Fed poured upon the\nfinancial markets because, in their view, we have yet to close in on the other parts of our\nmandate, to wit: “promot[ing] effectively the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.”\nSo where do we stand on those two fronts? Answer: closer than many think.\nI will be arguing at the upcoming FOMC meetings that while it is difficult to define “maximum\nemployment,” labor-market conditions are improving smartly, quicker than the principals of the\nFOMC expected. The commonly cited household survey unemployment rate has arrived at 6.1\npercent a full six months ahead of the schedule predicted only four weeks ago by the central\ntendency of the forecasts of FOMC participants. The most recent data indicate that nonfarm\nemployment surprised to the upside, increasing by 288,000 in June, and prior months’ increases\nwere revised upward. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ so-called JOLTS (Job Openings and\nLabor Turnover Survey) data indicate that job openings are trending sharply higher, while\n“quits” as a percentage of total separations continue to trend upward—a sign that workers are\nconfident of finding new and better opportunities if they leave their current positions.\nAnd there are areas where jobs are going unfilled. If you had opened the July 8 edition of the\nWall Street Journal to page A2, you would have seen an eye-catching headline: “Help Wanted:\nIn Truck Cabs.” This article noted that not only are we presently short 30,000 long-distance truck\ndrivers who earn an average annual pay of $49,540, but also that “[b]usinesses with openings\nacross the pay and education spectrum are struggling to hire house cleaners, registered nurses,\nengineers, software developers and other workers.”\nBoth statistically and anecdotally, we are now getting a consistent message from a variety of\nsources that the labor market, broadly considered—and not just in booming regional economies\nlike Texas’—is tightening. The employment gap is closing faster than most forecasters foresaw.\nIt should come as no surprise that wages are beginning to lift. For example, median usual weekly\nearnings collected as part of the Current Population Survey are now growing at a rate of 3\npercent, roughly their precrisis average. The latest survey of the National Federation of\nIndependent Business, released last week, shows the net percentage of small firms planning to\nraise wages is up sharply over the past year. In short, the key variable of the price of labor, which\nthe FOMC feared was stagnant, appears to have taken on life and is beginning to turn upward. It\nis not doing so dramatically. But the relationship between the unemployment rate and wage\ngrowth is nonlinear, so that as the unemployment rate falls, the incremental impact on wage\ngrowth accelerates. And wage growth is an important driver of inflation.\n6\n\n\fThe FOMC has a medium-term inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) price index. It is noteworthy that the 12-month consumer price\nindex (CPI), the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, and the so-called sticky CPI calculated by the\nAtlanta Fed have all crossed 2 percent, and the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate\nhas headline inflation averaging 1.7 percent on a 12-month basis, up from 1.3 percent only a few\nmonths ago.4 PCE inflation is clearly rising toward our 2 percent goal more quickly than the\nFOMC imagined.\nI want to be clear on this: I do not believe there is reason to panic on the price front. Just as I did\nnot worry when price increases were running below 2 percent, I am willing to tolerate\ntemporarily overshooting the 2 percent level in the case of supply shocks, as long as inflation\nexpectations are firmly anchored. But given that the inflation rate has been accelerating\norganically, I don’t believe there is room for complacency.\nLessons from Duck Hunting\nOne has to bear in mind that monetary policy has to lead economic developments. Monetary\npolicy is a bit like duck hunting. If you want to bag a mallard, you don’t aim where the bird is at\npresent, you aim ahead of its flight pattern. To me, the flight pattern of the economy is clearly\ntoward increasing employment and inflation that will sooner than expected pierce through the\ntolerance level of 2 percent.\nSome economists have argued that we should accept overshooting our 2 percent inflation target\nif it results in a lower unemployment rate. Or a more fulsome one as measured by participation in\nthe employment pool or the duration of unemployment. They submit that we can always tighten\npolicy ex post to bring down inflation once this has occurred.\nI would remind them that June’s unemployment rate of 6.1 percent was not a result of a fall in\nthe participation rate and that the median duration of unemployment has been declining. I would\nremind them, also, that monetary policy is unable to erase structural unemployment caused by\nskills mismatches or educational shortfalls. More critically, I would remind them of the\nasymmetry of the economic risks around full employment. The notion that “we can always\ntighten” if it turns out that the economy is stronger than we thought it would be or that we’ve\novershot full employment is dangerous. Tightening monetary policy once we have pushed past\nsustainable capacity limits has almost always resulted in recession, the last thing we need in the\naftermath of the crisis we have just suffered.\nDiluting the Punch from 108 Proof\nSo, what to do?\nOne might posit that by tapering our large-scale asset purchases with an eye to eliminating them\nin October, we have begun advance targeting with an eye to living up to our congressional\n7\n\n\fmandate. My sense is that ending our large-scale asset purchases this fall, however, will not be\nenough.\nMany financial pundits protest that weaning the markets of über-accommodation, however\ngradually, risks wreaking havoc, so dependent on central bank largess have the markets become.\nAs a former market operator, I am well aware of this risk. As I have said repeatedly, a bourbon\naddict doesn’t go from Wild Turkey to cold turkey overnight. But even if we stop adding to the\npotency of the financial punchbowl by finally ending our large-scale asset purchases in October,\nthe punch is still 108 proof.5 It remains intoxicating stuff.\nI believe the time to dilute the punch is close upon us. The FOMC could take two steps to\naccomplish this after ending our large-scale asset purchases.\nFirst, in October, we could begin tapering our reinvestment of maturing securities and begin\nincrementally shrinking our portfolio. I do not think this would have significant impact on the\neconomy. Some might worry that paring our reinvestment in MBS might hurt the housing\nmarket. But I believe the demand for housing is sufficiently robust to continue improving despite\na small rise in mortgage rates. The economy is improving. An acceleration of income growth that\nwill result will likely buttress a recovery in housing and compensate for the loss of momentum\nthat occurred during the winter freeze. (As a sidebar, I note that according to the National\nAssociation of Realtors, overseas buyers and new immigrants accounted for $92 billion, or 7\npercent, worth of home purchases in the U.S. in the 12 months ended in March, with one-fourth\nof those purchases coming from Chinese buyers. As Californians, you might find it of interest\nthat Los Angeles was the top destination for real estate searches from China on realtor.com; San\nFrancisco was second; Irvine was third.6)\nImportantly, I think that reducing our reinvestment of proceeds from maturing securities would\nbe a good first step for the markets to more gently begin discounting the inevitable second step:\nthat early next year, or potentially sooner depending on the pace of economic improvement, the\nFOMC may well begin to raise interest rates in gradual increments, finally beginning the process\nof policy normalization.\nProtecting the Fed as a Political Nuisance\nI mentioned at the onset that I think it imperative that the Fed be wary of giving rise to concerns\nthat we will be politically pliant. I’ll conclude with some comments on this, especially since\ncongressional hearings are currently underway to consider structural changes that might be called\nfor on the occasion of the Fed’s 100th anniversary.\nA little history helps put current events in perspective. When the German Reichsbank was\nformed in 1871, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was reportedly taken aside by his most\ntrusted adviser, Gerson Bleichröder, and warned “… that there would be occasions when\n8\n\n\fpolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\n[politically] independent a central bank would be a nuisance.”7\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany’s central bank led to\nthe hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy.\nAt great personal risk, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker made clear that the Federal Reserve would\nnot bequeath a similar destiny to the United States. Those of us who are the current trustees of\nthe Fed’s reputation—the FOMC—must be especially careful that nothing we do appears to be\npolitically motivated. In nourishing growth of the economy and employment, we must avoid\nerring on the side of coddling inflation to compensate for the inability of fiscal and regulatory\npolicymakers in the legislative and executive branches to do their job. We must not flinch from\ninsisting that our work is best done in a deliberate manner and never, ever for the sake of\nsatisfying the voyeurism of the media or politicians. We must all, Federal Reserve principals and\nstaff, and ordinary citizens alike, continue to protect the independence of the Fed and its ability\nto be a political nuisance.\nAnd now, Willow, in the best tradition of central banking, I will do my best to avoid answering\nany questions you and the audience might have.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Beer Goggles, Monetary Camels, the Eye of the Needle and the First Law of Holes (With\nReference to Peter Boockvar, the Book of Matthew, Sherlock Holmes, ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ and\nDenis Healey),” speech by Richard W.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSmithfield, R.I.\nMay 17, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f‘Never Let Your Brains Go to Your Head’\n(With Reference to the Sages of the Ages, Diana Sorensen,\nJohn Paul Jones and ‘Babe’ Fisher)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nBefore I begin my formal remarks, I want the candidates for degrees to think about the fact that\nover 5,000 people are here today to celebrate your success. These are your parents and\ngrandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts; your brothers and sisters; your friends; your teachers\nand coaches and counselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and lessjoyful ones. They have encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally\nbadgered and hectored you and … driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad\nand happy hearts to celebrate your admission to the society of educated men and women. You\nwill be applauded by them many times today. But I want you, the graduating class, to turn the\ntable on them and give them a round of applause. So stand up, turn around, put your hands\ntogether and give them a cheer. Thank them for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nI also want to salute the outgoing chairman of the Bryant University board of trustees, Michael\nEdward Fisher, ’67. I want to thank him not only for his six years as chairman and for his total\ndevotion to Bryant, but also for doing his family proud—especially his little brother … me.\nBlessed to Be Americans\nMike Fisher and I grew up in what can most charitably be described as “unusual circumstances.”\nOur father started out his life in conditions right out of Charles Dickens: At the age of 5 years\nand 2 months, he was arrested for begging for food and sentenced to seven years in Australia’s\nharshest prison, a God-awful place called Westbrook Reformatory.1 He was spared the destiny of\nmost inmates there—he was released quickly and lived to see better days—but to say he grew up\nrough is an understatement. Our mother, born in a small South African outpost where\nNorwegians, Swedes and Danes carved a life out of the “bush,” lost her father at the age of 4 and\nwas raised by a single mom who cooked for a boarding house. Neither of our parents had a\nformal education. But both were smart and ambitious for a better life. What did they do? They\ncame to America. It was here that their family flourished.\nIf you are ever tempted to doubt what hardworking immigrants bring to our shores and the power\nand moral imperative of a free economy or American-style democracy, think twice. Only in\nAmerica could two sons of a once-homeless beggar and the daughter of a boarding-house cook\nbecome what you see here on this stage today: One the distinguished chairman of the board of\ntrustees of Bryant University, and the other a policymaker for the most important central bank in\nthe world who is somehow deemed worthy of receiving an honorary doctorate and being chosen\nas speaker for the 151st commencement of this fine university. We are blessed to be Americans.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Sages of the Ages\nNow, the only thing that stands between you and receiving your Bryant degree is … me. I will\nspeak quickly and take up just a few moments of your time before you celebrate your\naccomplishments.\nBy now, you have taken enough writing courses to know the tongue-in-cheek definition of a\ngood essay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own!2 Most graduation\nspeeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is to dig through\nBartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations or resort to Google and Wikiquote to find\nsomething said by some sage that will grace a graduation ceremony with a lesson students can\ntake with them as they go off into this mysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement today, I pored over the\nsayings of the great minds through time: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammad, St. Paul and St.\nAugustine, Voltaire, Martin Luther, Mother Teresa … Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but you already know them or\nyou would not be where you are today: Be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and\nbrave; always question conventional wisdom; take risks; push the envelope; be true to yourself;\nnever promise more than you can deliver; never compromise your integrity; don’t waste your\ntalents; never forget that you have been given those talents in order to do good; never, ever, ever,\never give up the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all wise maxims. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if organizers would forgo a commencement speaker and simply remind the graduating\nclass to read and, throughout life, reread the Old and New Testament or the Quran or Confucius\nor Shakespeare—the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or\nlistened to.\nFor example, it would tax the capacity of the most powerful search engine to pull up the\ncountless commencement speakers who have lifted and adapted variations of Shakespeare’s lines\nin King Henry VI, Part 2, Act 4, Scene VII that “ignorance is the curse of God, [k]nowledge the\nwing wherewith we fly to heaven.”\nDiana Sorensen’s Dictum\nOne of the most intriguing living thinkers, Diana Sorensen, the dean of arts and humanities at\nHarvard University, defines a knowledgeable graduate taking wing as follows:\n“He or she is competent in making discerning judgments with tools derived from science,\nengineering, social science, the arts and humanities. He or she should be a persuasive speaker\nwho can articulate the reasons for his positions; who can write with clarity, elegance and\nconceptual power; an innovator who will take risks but first makes sure the limb they go out on\nis a sturdy one; a creative individual who has faced challenges posed by artistic production and\nexperimentation; a global citizen who can speak, read, write in at least a second language; and\nwho will learn what it takes to negotiate different world views emanating from different cultural\ntraditions, a tolerant yet rigorous thinker whose moral compass is guided by ethical reasoning.”3\n3\n\n\fClass of 2014, I don’t want to put any pressure on you! But that pretty much summarizes the\nskill set we all hope you have started to acquire at Bryant and will now go on to hone in life.\nBabe Fisher and John Paul Jones\nPreparing to speak to you today, I asked: How might I, a central banker whose musings are given\nto the arcana of economic and monetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the\nultimate sources? Not easily. So I dug deep into my memory bank and called upon a source more\nerudite than the lessons of the Bible or the Quran, Confucius or Shakespeare, and even more\ninsightful than Diana Sorensen—Mike’s and my mother, Magnhild Andersen Fisher, whom\neverybody called “Babe.”\nBabe Fisher never enjoyed the benefit of the type of education you have received. Yet she was a\nwise woman. She was a kind of female Nordic Yogi Berra who dispensed exquisite pearls of\nwisdom to her boys. One is especially germane for this ceremony. Our mother would say:\n“Never let your brains go to your head.” The pun is horrific but the message is profound: To\nachieve success, you will need to keep your superb education and your considerable talent in\nperspective. Brains and the gift of talent are necessary, but they are insufficient for success in\nlife.\nTime and again, in business and universities and government we see instances in which women\nand men of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\nThey do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with the same\ndevotion they applied to developing their intelligence quotient. My heartfelt advice to you is to\nwork as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ.\nYou all have great futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast, and enjoy it much more,\nif you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person\nand that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole\nperson is as important an achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of\neducated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\nAs a former midshipman, I have always been inspired by the creed of the father of the Navy,\nJohn Paul Jones, as written by his biographer Augustus Buell. “It is by no means enough that an\nofficer of the Navy should be a capable mariner. He must be that, of course, but also a great deal\nmore. He should be as well a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious\ncourtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor. He should be the soul of tact, patience, justice,\nfirmness, and charity. … Every commander should keep constantly before him the great truth,\nthat to be well obeyed, he must be perfectly esteemed.”\nI would say that Jones (or Buell) nailed it. Take the naval reference and the gender bias out, and\nyou have the ultimate guide for all of you who depart Bryant today aspiring to lead: You must be\nmore than smart and have more than a mighty intellect; you must develop the whole woman, the\nwhole man to be a leader in whatever field you chose.\n\n4\n\n\fA Smattering of Latin\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for most all commencement orations—a smattering of\nLatin. Commencement speakers at great schools seem to delight in showing off their command\nof an ancient tongue. Many a commencement speaker might have concluded this afternoon’s\nremarks with labor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor conquers all things. It is true,\nindeed, that you can’t rest on your laurels or your good family name or a Bryant education or just\nplain good luck. You have to work hard and sweat to succeed. And in doing so, you have to\nremember mens sana in corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is, after all, a festive day! So I will conclude with this:\n“Bubbus, sed possum explicarle, non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized, distorted\nLatin for “Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\nThis afternoon I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2014 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our people skills to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam (aha! Another Latin phrase!). But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you go through your promising lives remembering that the “whole person is\nthe best person”—my guess is that someday one of you in the Class of 2014 will be standing at\nthis very podium giving the commencement speech to some future generation of graduates and\ntheir thousands of supporters and admirers. And having the greatest pleasure a speaker can have:\nQuoting your very own mom.\nCongratulations, God bless you and good luck!\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nWestbrook: Surviving Australia’s Most Sadistic Reformatory, by William Stokes, Sydney, Australia: Macmillan\nby Pan Macmillan Australia, 2010.\n2\nIf memory serves from my days at Oxford University, this observation was noted by Graham Chapman, one of the\nstalwarts of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.\n3\nDean Sorensen’s comments are summarized in “Coming Back, Looking Forward,” Harvard Gazette, Sept. 26,\n2012.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nMay 9, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Tailored Regulation and Forward Guidance\n(With Reference to Dr. Seuss, Strother Martin in Cool Hand Luke\nand Other Serious Economists)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Drake (Mills). Your service as president of the Federal Reserve Board’s Community\nDepository Institutions Advisory Council is greatly appreciated. You are kind to have a Texan\ncome speak to you and your fellow Louisiana bankers, though this is not without precedent: The\ngreat blues guitarist and singer Clarence Garlow may have been born in Louisiana, but he had\nlong lived in Texas before he recorded “Bon Ton Roula” in 1949 and gave New Orleans the\nreputation of the American city where les bon temps rouler.\nIt would be hard to say that the good times are rolling for community bankers, though the pace\nand rhythm of the economies of the U.S. and Louisiana and your next-door neighbor, Texas, are\ngetting stronger daily.\nI have been outspoken as to why our community banks feel besieged. Everyone in this room and\ntheir sister or brother knows what I preach about the continuing problem of banks considered\n“too big to fail” and the witches’ brew that was concocted by Congress, known as Dodd–Frank.\nMy colleagues at the Dallas Fed and I submit that Louisiana’s and the nation’s community and\nregional banks play on an uneven playing field against the giant money-center banks. The Fed is\ncoming down hard on the big guys to ensure they are adequately capitalized and liquid. We are\nusing all means within our power to make sure they never again place the American taxpayer at\nrisk by bringing the financial system to its knees. But the fact remains that the big banks have a\ngreater share of the deposit market than ever, are coming into our communities and regions to\nlend money on terms and at prices that any banker with a memory cell knows from experience\nusually end in tears, and are putting independent bankers in a precarious position.\nAnd as to Dodd–Frank, I am skeptical that the bureaucracy and rules and regulations this\nmassive legislative initiative has created, even with the careful execution by the Fed, will\nvanquish too big to fail—the law’s very intention as stated in its preamble. But of this I am\ncertain: It has made the lives of community and regional banks vastly more complicated. Like\nalmost anything that comes out of the U.S. Congress, it has primarily been a boon to lawyers and\nconsultants and compliance officers, adding to expenses but doing little to help you grow your\nbusinesses.\nWe at the Dallas Fed are acutely conscious of this. We think of Dodd–Frank as akin to what Dr.\nSeuss once wrote about medicine:\nWhen at last we are sure\nYou’ve been properly pilled,\nThen a few paper forms\nMust be properly filled.\nSo that you and your heirs\nMay be properly billed. 1\n1\n\n\fInterest margins for community and regional banks have been shrinking for some 20 years. To be\nsure, the low interest rates the Fed has engineered to bring the economy out of the death spiral\nthreatened by the Financial Panic of 2007–09 exacerbated pressures on margins as we awaited\nthe strengthening economy we are now beginning to experience. But adding the pills and the\nbills of extra layers of compliance and legal expenses generated by Dodd–Frank has\ncompounded the difficulty of passing on profitable franchises to your banking heirs.\nThis is why, Systemwide, the Fed has been sensitive to the situation of banks under $50 billion,\nand especially sensitive to the situation of banks with less than $10 billion in footings. To be\nsure, we are as committed as ever to safety and soundness and the application of the law; we\nalways have been and always will be. But at the Dallas Fed, we believe we can apply the\nrequisite discipline required to safeguard our banking system in a way that is beneficial to\nregional and community banks. We and our fellow Federal Reserve Banks have worked hard to\ninstill a constructive and interactive relationship, rather than a hostile, purely formulaic one, with\nthe banks we supervise. You might have noted that Janet Yellen’s speech of May 1 to the\nIndependent Community Bankers was titled “Tailored Supervision of Community Banks.” The\nFederal Reserve banks take this charge seriously.\nThis is no idle claim. Just looking at the Eleventh District, we are increasingly being petitioned\nby banks for membership in the Federal Reserve System. The number of state member banks in\nthe Dallas Fed district increased by 8 percent in 2012, by 19 percent in 2013, and we have\nalready increased membership an annualized 26 percent in the first three months of 2014.\nSo I would just say this to those of you who are madder than (bleep!) about what Congress and\nthe regulators have wrought: The Federal Reserve knows what community and regional banks do\nfor their communities. We appreciate that you are the backbone for the homeowners, small\nbusinesses, service clubs and school sports teams and scouts and churches and myriad other\nactivities that make for better communities. We want you not only to endure, but to succeed and\ngrow. And we want to make sure you play on an even playing field with those who have legions\nof white-shoe lawyers and K Street lobbyists you couldn’t dream of affording.\nI wanted to just say that at the outset.\nMonetary Policy Going Forward: De-Spiking the Punch Bowl 10 Ounces at a Time\nNow, if you will indulge me, I want to speak of the direction of monetary policy from here\nonward.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is in the process of winding down its massive\npurchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. At our last meeting, in recognition that\nthe economy is improving and acknowledging that we have generated massive amounts of\nexcess reserves among depository institutions operating in the U.S., we voted to reduce our\npurchases to a combined $45 billion per month, on the path to eliminating them at the earliest\npracticable date. Speaking only for myself as a voting member, barring some destabilizing\ndevelopment in the real economy that comes out of left field, I will continue to vote for the pace\nof reduction we have undertaken, reducing by $10 billion per meeting our purchases and\neliminating them entirely at the October meeting with a final reduction of $15 billion.\n\n2\n\n\fI was not for this program, popularly known as QE3, to begin with. I doubted its efficacy and\nwas convinced that the financial system already had sufficient liquidity to finance recovery\nwithout providing tinder for future inflation. But I lost that argument in the fall of 2012, and I am\njust happy that we will be rid of the program soon enough.\nI am often asked why I do not support a more rapid deceleration of our purchases, given my\nagnosticism about their effectiveness and my concern that they might well be leading to froth in\ncertain segments of the financial markets. The answer is an admission of reality: We juiced the\ntrading and risk markets so extensively that they became somewhat addicted to our\naccommodation of their needs. You may remember the “taper tantrum” market operators threw\nlast spring when we broached the idea of temperance. It went over about as big as would saying\nyou wanted to ban Hurricanes and other happy-making libations here in New Orleans!\nPreventing Market Seizures and the DTs\nUntil just recently, Herb Kelleher was chairman of the Dallas Fed board. I can safely say that I\nhad the funniest chairman of any Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the smartest ever. Herb is not\nonly the iconic founder of Southwest Airlines, but he is also an iconic consumer of Wild Turkey\nBourbon. A wise man, he advised me that you can’t go from Wild Turkey to cold turkey\novernight. So despite having argued against spiking the punchbowl to the degree we did, I have\naccepted that the prudent course of action and the best way to prevent the onset of market\nseizures and delirium tremens is to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the flow of excess\nliquidity we have been supplying. The financial markets now seem to be unperturbed by and\nappear to be fully discounting the reduction pattern I am supporting.\nYou should bear in mind that the Fed works directly only with depository institutions. And that\nthey represent only a fifth or less of the credit markets in the U.S. And yet as I speak, depository\ninstitutions, including foreign banks doing business in the United States, have $2.5 trillion in\nexcess reserves on the books of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. So one would be hard pressed to\nsay that ending our asset purchases, which the depository institutions from which we buy them\ndeposit back with us as excess reserves, would deny the economy needed liquidity.\n“Normalizing” Policy\nThe focus of our discussions now is when and how to “normalize” monetary policy. Given that\nwe work directly with only 20 percent or less of the highly developed U.S. credit intermediation\nsystem, this becomes a complicated matter. It raises questions, for example, about whether we\nshould focus on the federal funds rate, which has been our traditional fulcrum, or some other\nmeasure, such as the rate we pay on excess reserves or that we pay on overnight reverse repos or\nsome mix thereof. You can expect to hear more about this as time passes. Today, I am going to\nfocus on another aspect of “normalization,” and that is: Once we have wound down QE3, when\nare we likely to raise the short-term rate that anchors the yield curve?\nIn the parlance of the trade, market operators and bankers alike are seeking “forward guidance”\nabout our intentions. I spoke about this at length in a recent speech in Hong Kong, and I refer\nyou to that speech if you need a sleeping aid this evening. 2\nThe Advent of the Dots\nThe intense focus on when we are likely to raise the overnight rate is understandable. I was a\nbanker in my previous life, before migrating to portfolio management; I spent 20 years in both\n3\n\n\fprofessions before going into public service so as to “pay it back.” As a banker and market\noperator, I naturally wanted to eliminate uncertainty as much as possible. The adage “don’t fight\nthe Fed,” was prevalent then, as it is now, so I would garner as much knowledge as possible\nabout future Federal Reserve intentions and moves in order to position my book.\nThen, we had little information. The FOMC under Paul Volcker did not even announce its\ndecisions, and the market was left to discover them on its own. Later, under Alan Greenspan, the\nFOMC began the process of releasing information about decisions taken, but any clues as to\nfuture intentions required one to divine some signal from the chairman’s almost mystical\npronouncements and oracular circumlocution. Chairman Ben Bernanke worked with the FOMC\nto instill greater transparency under the assumption that providing as much information as we\ncan enlightens markets so as to modulate the possible disruption of surprises and allows\ndecision-makers—from consumers to businesses to bankers and investors—to plan forward. To\nthis end, we now release copious amounts of information, including the forecasts of economic\nactivity and the year-end level at which we see the rate on overnight money trading, as foreseen\nby each individual FOMC participant under his or her assessment of appropriate monetary\npolicy.\nWe call this exercise the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP for short. We release it\nquarterly. I draw your attention to it because it has become something of a phenomenon among\nanalysts preoccupied with the entrails of policymaking and has taken on a life of its own. You\nread about it in the papers and get analysis of it from market soothsayers. Yet, I want to caution\nyou against becoming overly preoccupied with the FOMC’s SEP. In my less than humble\nopinion, it is a flawed tool. Let me explain why.\nHere is what the last SEP release for the fed funds rate looked like. It provided the FOMC\nparticipants’ projections for the overnight rate at year-end for the next three years and beyond to\nthe “longer run,” as foreseen from March 19:\n\n4\n\n\fFederal Reserve Policy Projections\n\nNOTE: Each “dot” indicates the value of an individual FOMC participant’s judgment of the appropriate level of the\ntarget federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nYou can see why it is referred to in the business as “the dot chart.” The best guesses of the entire\npanoply of participants in FOMC deliberations—19 when we have a full complement (the 12\nFed bankers and the maximum of seven governors appointed by the president subject to approval\nof the Senate)—are summarized in dots with the expected level on the “y-axis” and the year at\nthe end of which it is thought likely to occur on the “x-axis.”\nI use the term “best guesses” deliberately. The participants in the FOMC have sophisticated\neconometric models, a deep knowledge of theory and a great breadth of experience to draw\nupon. But truth be told, however we dress up our forecasts as rigorous analysis, they are no more\nthan the very best educated guesses of the superbly trained but still human staffs of the 12 Fed\nbankers and the active governors.\nAnd the composition of those among the FOMC participants who actually vote on policy\nchanges periodically. With the departure of Governor Jeremy Stein at the end of this month, we\nwill have eight people, including me, who vote on policy for the remainder of this year. We are\nhopeful that the full Senate will confirm the two governors who have now come out of the\nSenate Banking Committee, but we don’t know when that will occur. That will bring the total\nnumber of voters to 10. But the composition of those 10 voters will change each year going\nforward.\nHere, for example, is how the voters have changed just since last year and how the voting group\nwill morph on into 2016, with those names in red indicating new positions or votes.\n\n5\n\n\fChanging Policy Leadership Landscape\n December FOMC\nGovernors: Bernanke (Chairman), Yellen, Raskin, Tarullo, Powell, Stein, Vacant\nPresidents: Dudley (New York), Bullard (St. Louis), Evans (Chicago),\nGeorge (Kansas City), Rosengren (Boston)\n March FOMC\nGovernors: Bernanke, Yellen (Chair), Raskin, Tarullo, Powell, Stein, Vacant x3\nPresidents: Dudley (New York), Plosser (Philadelphia), Pianalto (Cleveland),\nFisher (Dallas), Kocherlakota (Minneapolis)\n June FOMC\nGovernors: Yellen (Chair), Tarullo, Powell, Stein, Fischer?*, Brainard?*, Vacant x2\nPresidents: Dudley (New York), Plosser (Philadelphia), Pianalto Mester (Cleveland),\nFisher (Dallas), Kocherlakota (Minneapolis)\n* Ms. Lael Brainard and Dr. Stanley Fischer have been nominated, but not yet confirmed, to be Fed governors.\n\nChanging Policy Leadership Landscape\n 2015 FOMC\nGovernors: Yellen (Chair), Tarullo, Powell, Fischer?*, Brainard?*, Vacant x2\nPresidents: Dudley (New York), Evans (Chicago), Lacker (Richmond),\nLockhart (Atlanta), Williams (San Francisco)\n 2016 FOMC\nGovernors:\nPresidents:\n\nYellen (Chair), Tarullo, Powell, Fischer?*, Brainard?*, Vacant x2\nDudley (New York), Bullard (St. Louis), George (Kansas City),\nMester (Cleveland), Rosengren (Boston)\n\n* Ms. Lael Brainard and Dr. Stanley Fischer have been nominated, but not yet confirmed, to be Fed governors.\n\n6\n\n\fDot-ology or Doxology?\nEven though the Fed has a remarkable assembly of the best economic thinkers on the planet\n(present company excluded), no one on the FOMC is a seer and none possess Nostradamus-like\ninsight, even when looking out just a couple of quarters; and, given that the roster of those who\nactually vote on policy is constantly changing, it is a wonder that the analytical community and\nmarket economists have become so fixated on “the dots.”\nSome analysts practically worship the dots. They have become analytical idols around which a\ndoxology of sorts has developed (“Praise dots from whom all insights flow”). Others consider\ntheir fallibility but still spill plenty of ink slicing and dicing them.\nFor example, here is a foray into dot-ology sent out on April 23 by the highly regarded chief\ninternational economist of Deutsche Bank, Torsten Slok: “One important question is how\nconfident FOMC members are in their forecasts. One way to measure this is to look at the\nstandard deviation around FOMC members’ forecasts of where they think the fed funds rate will\nbe in two years’ time, i.e. look at the standard deviation of the dots in the Fed’s dot chart. … At\ntheir latest meeting the FOMC members felt more certain about the coming hike in the fed funds\nrate than they did a year ago.” 3\nI cite Mr. Slok’s analysis only as an example of an entire field of study—a veritable industry—\nthat has evolved around “the dots.” So extensive is the preoccupation with this that it would not\nsurprise me if Harrah’s Casino here on Canal Street eventually starts taking bets on how the dots\nwill shift from quarter to quarter.\nSurely, economists of high repute are aware of the imperfections of this exercise and the\nfundamental problem with date-based forward guidance (projecting a schedule for future policy\nchanges). We, on the FOMC, certainly are.\nDr. Seuss or Strother Martin?\nThere have been suggestions from outside and within the Fed on how to better present our “best\nguesses” as to when we will move the base rate for anchoring the yield curve. For example, some\nhave suggested identifying which dots belong to current voting members of the FOMC. Others\nhave suggested that we report only the median of responses or the median of voter responses,\nrather than the entire array of dots. But neither of these approaches would do anything to\nenlighten the markets as to the views of future voters, nor would they overcome the underlying\nproblem with date-based forward guidance.\nWhat to do? If the dot chart creates confusion, one option would be to dispense with the exercise\naltogether. Having evoked Dr. Seuss earlier, I can imagine his bidding the dots farewell with\nsome ditty like this:\n\n7\n\n\fWe gave you form\nSo you’d inform\nAbout the price of dough.\nBut all you’ve done\nIs make for fun,\nAnd this we didn’t know.\nSo, out, damned dot!\nOut with the lot!\nIt’s clearly time to go.\nYet expressing the FOMC participants’ perceptions of, and possible reactions to, an assortment\nof future scenarios—however often the committee’s composition may change—does strike me as\nhaving some merit, if only to give markets insight into how the central bank might react under\ndifferent circumstances.\nIn the parlance of the trade, this is called “state-based” guidance. Yet here, too, we have\nstruggled. For example, until two meetings ago, we used an unemployment figure of 6½ percent\nas a point sometime after which we would begin to consider pulling back on monetary\naccommodation, then decided this wasn’t quite the ticket.\nThis may be a little more inside baseball than you expected to hear today, but here’s the point:\nExpect the Fed to continue refining its communications. We are getting better at it. But to invoke\nthe immortal words from the chain gang captain portrayed by Strother Martin in the 1967 movie\nCool Hand Luke: “What we’ve got here is failure to communicate.” We are working on it so that\nyou and other bankers, market operators, businesses and consumers will develop the best\npossible insight into how your monetary authority will behave. I expect that our new Chair, Janet\nYellen, will play a significant role here as she uses her press conferences to explain what simply\ncannot be communicated with a series of dots or within the statement we release after each\nmeeting.\nAlas, There Is Congress\nNow mind you, your monetary authority—your Federal Reserve—does not hold every card to\nyour future in its hand. No matter how clearly we communicate, no matter how expertly we tailor\nour supervision of your banks, no matter how we conduct monetary policy, our work is\nnecessary but not sufficient to the success of the Louisiana, Texas and U.S. economies. The\nfiscal authorities—Congress and the executive branch—must do their job to provide the proper\ntax, spending and regulatory incentives for businesses to take advantage of the cheap and\nabundant money the Fed has made possible and put it to work to grow, expand their payrolls and\nlet America truly prosper.\nI will spare you my thoughts on Congress (it is not very central banker-like to resort to\nprofanity). All I will say is that you and your neighbors and friends and customers are the ones\nwho elect people to office and whether you are a ‘D’ or an ‘R,’ you need only look at yourself in\nthe mirror to see who is in charge of placing the right people in office to get the job done of\nputting the American economy back on track. I’d say you have some serious work to do here.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nFor today, just bear in mind that the Fed is doing its utmost to be an enlightened regulator of\nyour banks. For the economy as a whole, there is abundant liquidity to finance economic\nexpansion, and the FOMC will assure that it remains affordable as long as the prospect of\ninflation rising above its 2 percent target remains in abeyance. It is too early to say that the\neconomy can declare laissez les bon temps rouler. But for you bankers in this audience today,\nyou might be forgiven if you kick up your heels a little bit while you are in New Orleans …\nthough the curmudgeonly old Fed will be watching to make sure that for its part, you don’t let\nthings get out of hand.\nThank you, Drake. Thank you all.\nNow, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions\nyou have.\nNotes\n1\n\nYou’re Only Old Once!: A Book for Obsolete Children, by Theodor Seuss Geisel, New York: Random\nHouse, 1986.\n2\nSee “Forward Guidance,” by Richard W.

It is always an honor to speak before the Asia Society anywhere in the\nworld but especially here in Hong Kong, one of my favorite cities. I was in Hong Kong during\nthe transition ceremonies in 1997 when the White House called to ask if I would become deputy\nU.S. trade representative. It was a position in which I served for four years under President\nClinton, and it put me on the path to high-level public service. That and my love for the\nspectacular food here have cemented Hong Kong in my heart. Thank you for inviting me to stop\nhere on my way to Beijing.\nI want to talk today about “forward guidance” in monetary policy. It is the subject du jour of\ncentral bankers. We’ve seen it popularized by the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, and it\nfigured prominently in the statement recently released by the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) of the Federal Reserve after our meeting of March 18–19 and again during the postmeeting press conference of the Fed Chair, Janet Yellen. It is front and center on the agenda of\nthe FOMC.\nTo understand forward guidance and its prominence in current discussions within monetary\npolicy circles, it helps to retrace recent history.\nAdieu Quantitative Easing\nTo encourage economic recovery from the debacle of the financial crisis of 2007–09, the FOMC\ncut interest rates to near zero. The Fed introduced an array of special lending facilities during the\nmost panicked stage of the crisis. These credit and liquidity programs were largely selfliquidating as market functioning improved. But still being “zero bound,” we embarked upon a\nprogram of massively expanding the Fed’s balance sheet, referred to internally as “large-scale\nasset purchases” and popularly known as quantitative easing (QE). By buying copious quantities\nof longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), our balance sheet\nhas grown from slightly under $900 billion prior to the crisis to $4.3 trillion at present.\nWhen the Fed buys a Treasury note or bond or an MBS, we pay for it, putting money out into the\neconomy with the expectation that the money will be used by banks and other creditors and\ninvestors to finance job-creating investment, the purchase of homes and other expansive\neconomic activity.\n\n2\n\n\fThus far, much of the money we have pushed out into the economy has been stored away rather\nthan expended to the desired degree. For example, we have seen a huge buildup in the reserves\nof the depository institutions of the United States. Less than a fifth of commercial credit in the\nhighly developed U.S. capital markets is extended through depository institutions. Yet depository\ninstitutions alone have accumulated a total of $2.57 trillion in excess reserves—money that is\nsitting on the sidelines rather than being loaned out into the economy. That’s up from a norm of\naround $2 billion before the crisis.\nThe Fed’s large-scale asset purchases dramatically and more broadly impacted credit markets.\nThe U.S. credit markets are awash in liquidity.\nAs of March 14, our par holdings of fixed-rate MBS exceeded 30 percent of the outstanding\nstock of those securities. Through these purchases, we have driven down mortgage rates and\nhelped rekindle the U.S. housing market.\nWe now own just shy of 24 percent of the stock of Treasury coupon securities. Having\nconcentrated our purchases of Treasuries further out on the yield curve, and done so in size, we\nhave driven nominal interest rates across the credit spectrum to lows not seen in over a half\ncentury.\nThis has allowed U.S. businesses to restructure their balance sheets, manage their earnings per\nshare through share buybacks financed with bargain-basement debt issuance, bolster stock prices\nthrough enhanced dividend payouts and position themselves for financing growth once they see\nthe whites of the eyes of greater certainty about their economic future. By driving nominal\ninterest rates to half-century lows, we have also reduced the hurdle rate by which future cash\nflows of publicly traded businesses are discounted. Thus, through financial engineering, we have\nhelped bolster a roaring bull market for equities: The indexes for stocks have nearly tripled from\nthe lows reached in March 2009.\nAlongside these signs of rebound have been some developments that give rise to caution. I have\nspoken of these in recent speeches, echoing concerns I have raised in FOMC discussions:\n• The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of stocks is among the highest decile of reported values\nsince 1881. Bob Shiller’s inflation-adjusted PE ratio reached 26 this week as the Standard\n& Poor’s 500 hit yet another record high. For context, the measure hit 30 before Black\nTuesday in 1929 and reached an all-time high of 44 before the dot-com implosion at the\nend of 1999.1\n• Since bottoming out five years ago, the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market as\na percentage of the country’s economic output has more than doubled to 145 percent—\nthe highest reading since the record was set in March 2000.\n\n3\n\n\f•\n•\n•\n\nMargin debt has been setting historic highs for several months running and, according to\ndata released by the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, now stands at $466 billion.2\nJunk-bond yields have declined below 5.5 percent, nearing record lows.3\nCovenant-lite lending is becoming more widespread. In my Federal Reserve District, 96\npercent of which is the booming economy of Texas, bankers are reporting that money\ncenter banks are lending on terms that are increasingly imprudent.\n\nThe former funds manager in me sees these as yellow lights. The central banker in me is\nreminded of the mandate to safeguard financial stability. As I said recently in a speech in\nMexico, we must watch these developments carefully lest we become responsible for raising the\nghost of irrational exuberance.\nIt is clear to me that we have a liquidity pool that is more than sufficiently deep and wide enough\nnationwide to finance job-creating capital expansion and reduce labor market “slack.” But that\nwill happen only if and when our fiscal authorities—the Congress and the president—are able to\nmuster the courage to craft tax, spending and regulatory incentives for job-creating enterprises to\nmobilize liquidity for expansion and payroll growth.\nThus far, inflation has yet to raise its ugly head, and inflation expectations as measured by\nconsumer surveys and market-traded instruments have remained stolid. However, with each\npassing day, constantly adding massive amounts to the monetary base will inevitably present a\nsignificant challenge to the FOMC, which must ultimately manage this high-power money so\nthat it does not become fuel for sustained inflation above the committee’s 2 percent target once it\nis activated and flows into the economy.\nThus, I was more than supportive of the collective decision of the FOMC to begin cutting back\non our rate of accumulation of assets beginning in December. Over the course of our recent\nmeetings, we have cut back from accumulating $85 billion per month in Treasuries and MBS to\na present rate of $55 billion per month. This is still somewhat promiscuous. Even with the taper,\nthe recent decline of mortgage supply has driven our absorption of the MBS market to 85 percent\nof fixed-rate MBS issuance. The fall in net MBS supply is outpacing the taper.\nAt the current reduction in the run rate of accumulation, the exercise known as QE3 will\nterminate in October (when I project we will hold more than 40 percent of the MBS market and\nalmost a fourth of outstanding Treasuries). We will then be back to managing monetary policy\nthrough the more traditional tool of the overnight lending rate that anchors the yield curve.\n\n4\n\n\fEnter Forward Guidance\nThis is no small matter. Quantitative easing has made life easy not only for corporate treasurers\nand homeowners and consumers burdened by debt, but also for money market operators. It has\nrun up the price of stocks and bonds mostly in straight-line fashion, and it has taken volatility out\nof the marketplace, allowing market operators and their clients to profit with little effort. The\nquestion of when and under what conditions the FOMC will begin to raise the base rate off the\nfloor is understandably of intense interest.\nFor example, every quarter, FOMC participants each provide forecasts of the year in which they\npresently think the target overnight rate will be raised, based on what they individually consider\nto be the proper conduct of monetary policy. This has given rise to what I consider a rabid focus\non the economic projections, or “dots,” that accompany our FOMC statements on a quarterly\nbasis. Monty Python could almost have written a sketch on the pundits’ preoccupation with the\ndots.4\nTruth be told, although many of us have econometric models and all of us have a phenomenal\nteam of economists who help us develop our projections, these estimates are, in the end, largely\nguesswork. Especially the further out in time they go. Yet the press and the markets focus on\nthem as though they were the writ of all-knowing, all-seeing monetary sages. On Monday night,\nfor example, there was much ado made about Janet Yellen noting in Chicago that the central\ntendency of our best guesses was that full employment would be somewhere between a 5.2 and\n5.6 percent unemployment rate.\nIt is nonetheless helpful to contemplate what may be useful guideposts for deciding when to raise\nthe base rate and how we may convey this to the markets. And so the FOMC is grappling with\njust what, in fact, we can provide the marketplace in the form of forward guidance about our\nfuture modus operandi.\nOdysseus or Apollo?\nResearch papers have addressed this subject. For example, some academic economists draw on\nGreek mythology to distinguish different techniques for crafting forward guidance, making a\ndistinction between Odyssean and Delphic forms of guidance.\nThe Odyssean model involves committing to a policy rule or to a criterion for choosing between\ndifferent policy alternatives. Policymakers tie themselves to the mast of this rule or criterion,\nsacrificing some of their short-run freedom of action in order to achieve what they hope will be\nsuperior outcomes over the long term. In monetary policy, commitment can in theory reduce the\nrisk of future recession and more tightly control medium-horizon inflation expectations at the\ncost of a somewhat poorer near-term inflation or unemployment performance.\n\n5\n\n\fCommitments come in lots of different flavors and styles, and forward guidance isn’t necessarily\nhelpful or wise just because it’s Odyssean. Tying yourself to the mast isn’t an especially good\nidea if your ship is sinking, or if enemy forces are directing fire toward your deck. Committing to\na particular path for the funds rate, or to a time schedule for funds-rate liftoff, is not something in\nwhich I or many of my colleagues have any interest. Commitments that are contingent on future\neconomic conditions, in contrast, enjoy at least some support on the FOMC. President\n(Narayana) Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed, for example, has notably proposed that the\ncommittee promise to delay liftoff at least until either the unemployment rate reaches 5 1/2\npercent or forecasted inflation hits 2 1/4 percent (provided longer-term inflation expectations\nremain well-anchored, and possible risks to financial stability remain well-contained).\nMy own view is that commitments aren’t always credible, especially if they purport to extend far\ninto the future. It’s hard to bind future policymakers, and it’s difficult to anticipate all the various\neconomic circumstances that might arise down the road. As a general rule, then, the further into\nthe future a commitment extends, the vaguer it tends to be. Along these lines, the FOMC\nperiodically reiterates its commitment to do what it is legally mandated to do: pursue full\nemployment, price stability and a stable financial system. But getting from there to an actual\nprescription for the funds rate isn’t straightforward. If it were, FOMC meetings wouldn’t take\neight-plus hours of discussion and hundreds of pages of briefing materials.\nDelphic forward guidance is less binding than Odyssean guidance. Like the responses of the\noracle of Apollo at Delphi, it is more obscure, more enigmatic. It amounts to saying, “Here’s\nwhat we think we are going to want to do if the economy evolves as we currently expect.”\nDelphic guidance clarifies your current thinking about future policy without making any\npromises—even contingent promises.\nOur current FOMC statement is chock-full of Delphic guidance. On asset purchases: “If\nincoming information broadly supports the committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in\nlabor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the\ncommittee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps ...” On the\ntiming of liftoff: “The committee continues to anticipate ... that it likely will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset\npurchase program ends ...” On the post-liftoff path of the funds rate: “The committee currently\nanticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels,\neconomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below\nlevels the committee views as normal in the longer run.”\nAs a former practitioner, I can tell you that market operators prefer Odyssean guidance to\nDelphic guidance, and within the Odyssean model, tend to prefer inflexible, calendar-based\nguidance to guidance that’s either conditional or qualitative. Life in my former incarnation would\n\n6\n\n\fnaturally be much more pleasant if I could dial in the specific dates and levels of interest rate\nmovements. But as a central banker, I am haunted by a comment made by Winston Churchill in\n1926, shortly before things began to unravel in the global financial markets. Speaking at the\nWaldorf Hotel in London, he said: “In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and\neverything that is sound is disagreeable.”5\nI worry that the predictability of calendar-based commitments can quite possibly be unsound in\ntwo key dimensions. First, the quantitative moorings may be misplaced—especially given shifts\nin economic relationships following the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Second, I\nquestion if it is sound policy to remove all uncertainty or volatility from the market. I wonder\nwhether being totally predictable may, at best, lead to a false complacency that can too easily be\nupset should we need to change course. At its worst, I fear calendar-based commitments can\nlead, perversely, to market instability by encouraging markets to overshoot, as they appear to be\ndoing in some quarters at present. I say “calendar-based commitments,” even though the FOMC\nhas tried to couch its calendar-based guidance in Delphic language. The problem is that guidance\nintended to be Delphic is, in practice, often given an Odyssean interpretation. Whether because\nof wishful thinking by market operators or because of policymaker inertia (it’s easier to stick\nwith the previously announced plan than to explain a departure from that plan), the Delphic\nundergoes metamorphosis and becomes Odyssean.\nThus, I wonder if anything beyond the Delphic is practicable, as much as I might like to set our\ncompass on autopilot. But even expressing meaningful forward guidance along more amorphous\nlines is challenging.\n‘We’ll See’: 摸石頭過河\nThe point is: Forward guidance can be a complicated monetary policy tool. I had an interesting\ndiscussion about this two weeks ago with a couple of the members of the Bank of England’s\nMonetary Policy Committee (MPC). They noted that Chris Giles of the Financial Times has\ndevoted a substantial amount of thoughtful attention to the discussion of forward guidance.\nIn Giles’ Money Supply blog post of Oct. 2, 2013, he wrote: “Forget triggers, thresholds,\nknockouts and long lists of conditions. Paul Fisher, the Bank of England’s head of markets, says\neveryone is wrong to think forward guidance is complicated. The policy was summarized in a\nsingle simple sentence of the [Bank of England’s] explanatory document, he said in a speech\ntoday. This is the sentence,” and I’m quoting Giles quoting Paul Fisher: “In essence, the MPC\njudges that, until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it will be\nappropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy, provided\nthat such an approach remains consistent with its primary objective of price stability and does\nnot endanger financial stability.”\n\n7\n\n\fTo a central banker, that may have seemed about as concise a Delphic statement as possible. But\nGiles suggested, “I’m sure we can all do better than that.” He took a stab at translating the\nsentence himself, suggesting that it meant “the MPC will let the recovery run for as long as it\ncan,” but he invited others who might have “better, more elegant and more accurate translations”\nto submit them via social media. Later that day, he announced the best summation received.\nForward guidance expressed in a two word sentence: “We’ll see.”6\nThat about sums it up. The FOMC is seeking to make sure that we have a sustained recovery\nwithout giving rise to inflation or market instability. We will conduct monetary policy\naccordingly. Regardless of the way we may finally agree at the FOMC to write it out or have\nChair Yellen explain it at a press conference, we really cannot say more than that.\nSo that’s where we are: “We’ll see.” Or as Deng Xiaoping would have phrased it: “We will cross\nthe river by feeling the stones” (摸石頭過河). We will feel the stones of the economy with the\nbottoms of our feet as central bankers and proceed accordingly.\nDraghi’s Old Man\nAt a recent meeting I attended in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank told of a\nman who needed a heart transplant. The doctor leveled with him that he had several choices,\nincluding the heart of a 75-year-old central banker. “I’ll take that one,” the man answered\nimmediately. “Why?” the doctor asked. “Well,” said the man, “because it’s never been used.”\nAs was made clear in Chair Yellen’s speech in Chicago earlier this week, central bankers have\nhearts, and the Fed is working to harness monetary policy to relieve the plight of the cyclically\nunemployed. But we also need to be vigilant in making clear that we are obligated to maintain\nprice stability and that allowing inflation to take grip is a cardinal sin for a central bank, for it is\nthe cruelest of afflictions for all of society.\nJoachim Fels of Morgan Stanley noted that Draghi’s little joke serves as a reminder not that my\ncolleagues and I at the Federal Reserve belong to a heartless tribe but that “central banking is\nabout making rational, cool-headed and unemotional decisions often under difficult\ncircumstances.”7 We must conduct monetary policy in a cool-headed and unemotional manner in\norder to achieve both of the mandates Congress has given us—preserving price stability and\nachieving full employment—while avoiding financial market turbulence.\nThis is the very best we can offer you, whether you are from ancient Ithaca or Delphi or modern\nHong Kong. Those who think we can be more specific in stating our intentions and broadcasting\nour every next move with complete certainty are, in my opinion, clinging to the myth that\neconomics is a hard science and monetary policy a precise scientific procedure rather than the\napplied best judgment of cool-headed, unemotional decision-makers.\n8\n\n\fWe will cross the river that separates us from a normalized economy and a normalized monetary\npolicy by feeling the stones. We may slip on occasion, but you should not underestimate our\nintention to apply whatever talents we possess as policymakers to do what is right to advance\neconomic prosperity while strictly adhering to our commitment of containing inflation and\nmaintaining market stability.\nThank you (謝謝).\nNotes\n1\n\nRobert Shiller’s price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings\nfrom the previous 10 years, known as the cyclically adjusted PE ratio.\n2\nData on market activity and margin debt can be found at\nwww.nyxdata.com/nysedata/asp/factbook/viewer_interactive.asp.\n3\nAs measured by the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch high-yield corporate debt index covering credits\nrated BB+ and below.\n4\nMonty Python is the British comedy troupe known for its satirical skits.

Fisher\nPresidente y Director Ejecutivo\nBanco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas\n\nCiudad de México, México\n5 de marzo de 2014\n\nLos puntos de vista expresados son exclusivamente míos y no reflejan necesariamente la posición oficial del Sistema de la\nReserva Federal.\n\n\f¡Ándale Pues! Habiendo tomado decisiones difíciles, México\nestá en posición de beneficiarse de las reformas y de navegar\nel tapering de la Reserva Federal con relativa facilidad\nRichard W. Fisher\nGracias, Luis [Robles], por tu amable presentación. Es un placer estar aquí esta noche como\ninvitado de la Asociación de Bancos de México y con mis compadres del banco central. Acabo\nde volver de Europa donde tuve reuniones con líderes del Banco Central Europeo y del Banco\nNacional de Suiza.\nLe agradezco mucho al gobernador Agustín Carstens la hospitalidad que me ha brindado. El\nBanco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas y el Banco de México continúan gozando de una larga\nhistoria de colaboración. Para mí, Banxico es nuestro banco hermano. Durante los años de su\njuventud, Agustín pasó algún tiempo en la Reserva Federal de Dallas, y nos sentimos orgullosos\nde haber desempeñado un pequeño papel en su exitosa carrera.\nPor muchos años, la sucursal de El Paso de la Reserva Federal de Dallas ha celebrado reuniones\nde consejo e intercambios informativos con la Junta Directiva Regional del Banco de México en\nCiudad Juárez. Ahora también nuestras sucursales de Houston y San Antonio llevan a cabo\nreuniones similares con sus homólogos del Banco de México. Además, el predecesor del\ngobernador Carstens, Guillermo Ortiz, es miembro del Consejo Asesor del Instituto de\nGlobalización y Política Monetaria de la Reserva Federal de Dallas. El Banco de la Reserva\nFederal de Dallas y el Banco de México comparten una relación única y mutuamente\nbeneficiosa.\nComo Guillermo y Agustín bien saben, también existe una dimensión personal en la relación\nentre nuestras instituciones. Yo crecí en la Ciudad de México en la década de los 50, y asistí a\nuna escuela primaria no muy lejos de aquí. El español fue mi primer idioma en la escuela.\nTodavía tengo muchos amigos en el Norte que dicen que hablo el español mejor que el inglés,\nsin duda porque hablo inglés con acento texano. Yo nomás les digo con orgullo, “No hablo\nespañol; ¡hablo puro mexicano!” Esta noche, me esforzaré lo más posible por hablarles en\nespañol mexicano y no en inglés texano.\nUna política monetaria estadounidense sin precedentes\nComo ustedes seguramente saben, y como me complace informarles en caso contrario, el Comité\nFederal de Mercado Abierto (“FOMC” por sus siglas en inglés), encargado de la política\nmonetaria estadounidense, está finalizando su fase extraordinaria de compras masivas de activos,\nmejor conocida como “QE” por sus siglas en inglés. La Gran Recesión exigió una política\nextraordinaria, y el FOMC respondió. Liderado por el Chairman Bernanke, el FOMC enfrentó\nsin rodeos la crisis financiera en septiembre de 2007, y a finales de 2008 ya había bajado la tasa\nde fondos federales del 5.25 por ciento a cero.\nCuando la crisis financiera azotó con toda su fuerza, después de la quiebra de Lehman Brothers,\nla tasa de los fondos federales resultó insuficiente como herramienta. Primero tuvieron que ser\n1\n\n\frescatadas empresas, después el sistema bancario y finalmente toda la economía. El pensamiento\nconvencional sostenía que las autoridades responsables podrían hacer muy poco después de que\nla tasa de interés controlada por la Reserva Federal llegó a cero– pero el FOMC pensó lo\ncontrario.\nA mediados de 2009, el producto interno bruto (o PIB) de Estados Unidos comenzó a\nrecuperarse después de haberse contraído un 4.3 por ciento. El progreso fue dolorosamente lento\npero en el tercer trimestre, el PIB mostró un crecimiento del 1.3 por ciento y colocó de nuevo a\nEstados Unidos en una trayectoria de crecimiento. Sin embargo, el mercado laboral no registró\nmejoría. La tasa de desempleo era del 9.6 por ciento, en buena medida como resultado de que el\nempleo no crecía, y los salarios reales estaban cayendo.\nEl mercado laboral juega un papel fundamental en las deliberaciones del FOMC. Mientras que\ncasi todos los demás bancos centrales, incluyendo el Banco de México, están obligados por ley a\ngarantizar solamente la estabilidad de los precios, a su par en Estados Unidos se le ha impuesto\nun doble mandato: garantizar la estabilidad de los precios y el máximo empleo. A mediados de\n2009, el déficit de empleos (es decir empleos perdidos desde el nivel máximo de empleo antes de\nla recesión) era de 8 millones y seguía aumentando.\nPor consiguiente, nos embarcamos en un agresivo plan de compra de activos, con la adquisición\na gran escala de bonos del Tesoro y de títulos de deudas hipotecarias emitidos por agencias\nparagubernamentales de préstamos para la vivienda de Estados Unidos. La primera ronda de\ncompra de activos duró hasta marzo de 2010 cuando el mercado laboral finalmente empezó a\nrecuperarse. Al término de la primera ronda, la Reserva Federal había inyectado a la economía\n$1.25 billones de dólares en liquidez. La segunda y tercera ronda de QE se anunciaron en\nnoviembre de 2010 y en septiembre de 2012, respectivamente.\nCuando la Reserva Federal comenzó el tapering, es decir, a reducir el ritmo de estas compras de\nactivos, en diciembre de 2013, el balance general de esta institución había aumentado\nsustancialmente de menos de $1 billón de dólares a más de $4 billones de dólares en tan sólo\ncuatro años. Actualmente, la Reserva Federal tiene un volumen y diversidad de activos nunca\nantes visto. En consecuencia, los bancos mantienen una cantidad de reservas sin precedentes. Las\nreservas totales en las instituciones bancarias se han disparado de $45 mil millones de dólares\nantes de la crisis a $2.5 billones de dólares en la actualidad. El stock de reservas bancarias a la\nespera de ser inyectado en la economía a través de nuestro sistema bancario es vasto y,\nlamentablemente, casi totalmente desaprovechado.\nHay una gran abundancia de dinero disponible para el uso de las empresas estadounidenses.\nConsideren lo siguiente: en el cuarto trimestre de 2007, el PIB de Estados Unidos era de $14.7\nbillones de dólares; y al finalizar el año 2013 era de aproximadamente $17.1 billones de dólares.\nSi hubiéramos seguido por el camino por el que íbamos antes de la crisis, el PIB real actualmente\nsería de aproximadamente $20 billones de dólares. O sea, un tercio más grande de lo que era en\n2007. Sin embargo, la cantidad de dinero no utilizado en el sistema bancario es 60 veces mayor\nahora que al finalizar el año 2007. No es la falta de liquidez lo que impide que las empresas\npongan de nuevo a la gente a trabajar.\n\n2\n\n\fEl dinero es barato y abundante, pero la recuperación es decepcionante\nLa Reserva Federal ha creado una oportunidad para que otros actúen. El dinero es barato y\nabundante. El objetivo ahora es que los bancos presten dinero, que los consumidores soliciten\npréstamos y que las empresas inviertan para crear empleos y expandir la actividad económica.\nCon una política monetaria tan agresiva, es sorprendente que la recuperación económica haya\nsido tan mediocre. A pesar de los datos recientes que muestran que los consumidores están\npidiendo dinero prestado una vez más, a cuatro años y medio de la recuperación económica el\nempleo todavía no ha alcanzado el nivel que mostraba antes de la recesión, haciendo que esta sea\nla recuperación económica más lenta de las ultimas 12 que ha experimentado Estados Unidos\ndesde la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\nUno de los problemas ha sido el lento ritmo de la recuperación en las demás economías\navanzadas. La crisis financiera fue un fenómeno global que afectó por igual a las economías de\nmercados avanzados y emergentes. Sin embargo, las economías de mercados emergentes se\nrecuperaron y, en casi todos los casos, han superado desde hace mucho tiempo sus niveles de\nproducción previos a la crisis. Este no ha sido el caso en las economías avanzadas.\nEuropa y la Eurozona, que han sido perjudicadas por una serie de crisis de deuda soberana como\nresultado de la crisis financiera y la adopción de una moneda única, siguen siendo importantes\npara la economía mundial, y los problemas en la región inevitablemente tienen repercusiones\ninternacionales. La buena noticia es que la promesa que hizo el Presidente del Banco Central\nEuropeo, Mario Draghi, en 2012 de “hacer lo que sea necesario” para estabilizar la situación,\nparece haber funcionado y ganado tiempo para llevar a cabo reformas muy necesarias. El viernes\npasado, conversé unas horas con el Presidente Draghi y los gobernadores del Banco Central\nEuropeo y es evidente que los datos recientes muestran algunos signos alentadores de que tal vez\nya pasó lo peor.\nEntre tanto, parece que en Japón la “Abenomics” está logrando acabar con la deflación que ha\ndurado varias décadas, aunque el progreso en las reformas estructurales –crucial para restablecer\nel crecimiento a largo plazo– ha sido decepcionante. Hay una lección importante que aprender\naquí, una que voy a volver a mencionar más adelante: la política monetaria no puede\nsolucionarlo todo. En el caso de Japón, la política monetaria puede poner fin a la deflación que\nha caracterizado a la economía desde finales de los años noventa, pero puede hacer poco para\nimpulsar la expansión a largo plazo, a menos que vaya acompañada de una política fiscal que\nimplemente cambios estructurales.\nPero el mayor problema que enfrentan Estados Unidos es interno: el fracaso político de\nWashington al no tomar medidas para solucionar los problemas fundamentales que continúan\nfrenando la recuperación. La incertidumbre fiscal y regulatoria es un poderoso impedimento para\nla inversión privada. Volviendo a los primeros días de la recuperación actual, mis contactos entre\nla comunidad empresarial se han quejado con regularidad de la niebla de incertidumbre que\nemana de Washington. Ellos han mencionado constantemente que los dos factores que acabo de\nidentificar son los principales impedimentos para la inversión de capital y la expansión del\nempleo.\nLa incertidumbre viene de muchas fuentes. En algunos casos es una nueva ley como la reforma\nal sistema de salud, o una regulación financiera, como la ley “Dodd Frank” [Ley de Reforma de\nWall Street y Protección al Consumidor]. Los problemas fiscales regularmente han restringido la\n3\n\n\frecuperación. Valgan como ejemplo la crisis desatada por la negación del Congreso a extenderle\na la Tesorería la autorización necesaria para aumentar la deuda en el verano de 2011, la\nresolución a última hora del conflicto sobre una extensión de recortes de impuestos en diciembre\nde 2012, y los recortes presupuestales indiscriminados y automáticos que se implementaron hace\nun año. Lo más desconcertante es la incertidumbre de las empresas sobre cuál será en definitiva\nsu carga impositiva y de la ciudadanía en general sobre el monto del gasto público en el futuro.\nEsto hace que la elaboración de proyecciones presupuestarias y la planeación de inversiones de\ncapital y de nóminas salariales sea un proceso incierto.\nEs mi opinión personal que la Reserva Federal ha ganado tiempo para que las autoridades\nfiscales pongan su casa en orden, pero cuatro años más tarde no estoy seguro de que estemos más\ncerca de esa meta. Es cierto que los políticos de Washington dejaron de pelear en diciembre para\naprobar un presupuesto, el primer presupuesto en cuatro años. Y este año fiscal el déficit\npresupuestario proyectado es sólo el 3 por ciento del PIB, a comparación del 4.1 por ciento en\n2013 y el 7 por ciento en 2012. Tras cinco años de enormes déficits, Estados Unidos finalmente\nestá a la par de México, cuyo déficit a lo largo de la recuperación nunca excedió el 2.8 por ciento\ndel producto interno bruto.\nSe podría pensar que acordar un presupuesto significa que el gobierno de Estados Unidos puede\nseguir desempeñando sus funciones, cobrando impuestos, financiando los servicios del gobierno\ny manteniendo los monumentos abiertos a los turistas. Pero en Estados Unidos tenemos otro\nobstáculo, el límite de la deuda pública, lo que llamamos el “debt ceiling”. Esta batalla ritual, que\nhemos peleado por lo menos 87 veces desde el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, no aborda\nlos desequilibrios fundamentales de nuestra situación fiscal. Sin embargo, volvemos a ellos con\nregularidad, como lo hicimos en febrero cuando el Congreso aprobó el aumento del límite de\nendeudamiento sin dar una gran pelea. La última vez, como recordarán, las cosas no salieron tan\nbien. Los mercados bursátiles se tambalearon, el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) emitió\nadvertencias, y una de las agencias de calificación crediticia degradó la deuda pública\nestadounidense.\nEl límite de endeudamiento puede ser bienintencionado y establecido para proteger a nuestros\nhijos de nuestros excesos y los de las generaciones anteriores, pero ha sido totalmente ineficaz\npara detener el aumento de la deuda. También puede estar contribuyendo a la incertidumbre que\nestá obstaculizando la recuperación. La deuda estadounidense en manos del público ha\naumentado sustancialmente hasta llegar al 76 por ciento del producto interno bruto (PIB), a\ncomparación del 36 por ciento en 2007. Estados Unidos está alcanzando una razón deudaproducto interno bruto no vista desde el término de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. En cambio, la\ndeuda de México es relativamente pequeña, alrededor del 30 por ciento del producto interno\nbruto, aunque también ha aumentado, en comparación del 20 por ciento en 2007.\nAquí en México, como en Estados Unidos, la recesión empeoró la situación fiscal, disminuyendo\nlos ingresos fiscales mientras aumentaban los gastos. Por otra parte, las trayectorias de los dos\npaíses son bastante diferentes. Mientras que el crecimiento de la deuda pública estadounidense se\nha desacelerado temporalmente, se espera que factores a largo plazo hagan que la razón deudaproducto interno bruto alcance el 100 por ciento en el año 2038, desde donde probablemente\ncontinuará aumentando. En contraste, se prevé que la razón deuda-producto interno bruto de\nMéxico se reducirá una vez que se implemente plenamente la reforma fiscal recientemente\naprobada.\n4\n\n\fEsta época de liquidez y bajas tasas de interés sin precedentes le brindó a Estados Unidos por lo\nmenos tres grandes oportunidades:\nUna fue abordar las perspectivas fiscales a largo plazo, reformando programas como el Seguro\nSocial y Medicare. Debemos crear un sistema equilibrado que evite que los pasivos futuros se\ndisparen fuera de control.\nLa segunda fue aprobar reformas reglamentarias para reducir el riesgo de futuras crisis de\nmercados financieros y garantizar que entidades demasiado grandes para quebrar (“Too Big To\nFail”) nunca más vuelvan a colocar a Estados Unidos en una posición tal que los fondos de los\ncontribuyentes deban usarse para rescatar a inversionistas imprudentes.\nLa tercera fue reestructurar la deuda pública mientras las tasas de interés a largo plazo estaban en\nniveles mínimos históricos. Dentro de los próximos cuatro años, se vencerá el 58 por ciento de la\ndeuda pública estadounidense. Y aunque ahora las tasas de interés a corto plazo son bajas, no\nseguirán bajas por siempre. Cuando la deuda existente venza, estarán más altas las tasas y el\npago de la deuda absorberá una mayor parte del presupuesto, dejando menos para gastar en todo\nlo demás. Ciertamente invita a la reflexión la proyección de que los pagos de intereses netos de\nla deuda se triplicarán a finales de la década, pasando de $221 mil millones de dólares en el año\nfiscal 2013 (1.3 por ciento del producto interno bruto) a $635 mil millones de dólares en el año\nfiscal 2020 (2.8 por ciento del producto interno bruto).\nYo diría que esta época de dinero barato no ha sido aprovechada de la mejor manera en los tres\nfrentes mencionados. Por si fuera poco, hay cada vez más señales de que la política monetaria de\nQE ha durado demasiado: las distorsiones del mercado y las actuaciones basadas en malos\nincentivos son cada vez más predominantes.\nLos indicadores del mercado bursátil, tales como los que miden la relación entre precios y\nutilidades proyectadas y entre precios y ventas, así como también la capitalización de mercado\ncomo porcentaje del PIB, han alcanzado niveles llamativos, no vistos desde el auge de las\nempresas “dot-com” a finales de la década de los noventa. En palabras de James Mackintosh,\nautor de la columna “The Short View” del Financial Times, un gran número de acciones en el\nS&P 500 tiene valoraciones “que se basan en la creencia en un hada madrina financiera”.\nEl nivel de apalancamiento está llegando a niveles históricos. En el mercado de bonos, la\nreducida brecha entre las tasas de interés de la deuda de empresas y la deuda del Tesoro de\nEstados Unidos no parece reflejar el nivel de riesgo que debería, como si los bajos rendimientos\nnominales hubieran tentado a los inversionistas a colocar sus ahorros en activos financieros que\nen otras circunstancias hubieran considerado demasiado riesgosos. Debemos vigilar estos\nindicadores muy cuidadosamente para garantizar que el fantasma de la “exuberancia irracional”\nno nos atormente una vez más.\nLas secuelas de la QE\nComo ustedes bien saben, los efectos de la QE en Estados Unidos y en otras economías\navanzadas no se detienen en las fronteras nacionales. Se extienden hacia el resto del mundo.\nDebido a las acciones de banqueros centrales, las tasas de interés están en mínimos históricos y\nlos inversionistas han buscado mayor rendimiento en otros países, generando un enorme flujo de\n5\n\n\fcapital hacia economías de mercados emergentes (EME), incluyendo a México. No olvidemos\nque el flujo de capital a economías de mercados emergentes era considerable incluso antes de la\ncrisis. Hecha la aclaración, el flujo de capitales aumentó aún más a medida que la QE cobró\nímpetu en Estados Unidos y otras naciones adoptaron políticas similares. Por ejemplo, el capital\nacumulado procedente de Estados Unidos como porcentaje del producto interno bruto de mi país\naumentó del 11 al 17 por ciento en Brasil y del 18 al 25 por ciento en México entre 2008 y 2012.\nDurante este tiempo, el flujo de capitales estuvo conformado cada vez más por inversión de\ncartera en lugar de inversión directa.\nLas noticias del “tapering” por parte de la Reserva Federal a finales de la primavera del año\npasado originó una salida de capitales de corto plazo en esos países emergentes, induciendo la\ndepreciación de sus respectivas monedas con respecto al dólar. La tasa de interés sobre la deuda\nsoberana aumentó bruscamente en naciones de mercados emergentes vulnerables, como Brasil y\nTurquía. En el caso de México la subida fue mucho menos pronunciada que en otras economías\nemergentes. Así como sucede en la mañana después de una fiesta la noche anterior, los\ninversionistas se despertaron sobrios y más exigentes.\nPor qué México se distingue de los demás\nExiste preocupación de que el excesivo flujo de capitales hacia economías emergentes durante\nlas sucesivas rondas de QE haya provocado la disminución de las tasas de interés y conducido a\nlos consumidores y empresas a incurrir en un nivel de endeudamiento demasiado alto. México\nparece estar mejor posicionado que muchos otros países en cuanto a esta exposición al riesgo.\nMientras que, según el Banco de México, los préstamos privados han aumentado un 38 por\nciento desde su más bajo nivel observado después de la recesión en 2010, las comparaciones\ninternacionales basadas en cifras del Banco Mundial muestran que la tasa de expansión del\ncrédito en México no es nada en comparación con otros países con mercados emergentes.\nEntre 2009 y 2012, los préstamos privados como porcentaje del producto interno bruto\naumentaron 5 puntos porcentuales en México, mientras que saltaron 20 puntos porcentuales en\nBrasil. El nivel de exposición a deuda también es menor en México que en muchos otros países\ncon mercados emergentes. Los préstamos privados como porcentaje del producto interno bruto\nfueron del 28 por ciento en México en 2012, en comparación con el 35 por ciento en Indonesia,\nel 54 por ciento en Turquía y el 68 por ciento en Brasil.\nEn mi vuelo desde Zurich, leí sobre unos incidentes regulatorios, pero estoy convencido de que\nel sistema bancario mexicano es saludable. Las ganancias bancarias aumentaron en 2013 y los\nbancos mexicanos están bien capitalizados, con una razón de capital agregado del 16 por ciento\nal finalizar el año 2013. Aunque cuatro bancos pequeños no pasaron las pruebas de estrés\nadministradas por la Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV) y se les pidió que\naumentaran el capital y diversificaran sus carteras, hay que tener en cuenta que fue también el\nprimer año en que el regulador implementó plenamente las estrictas normas de capital de Basilea\nIII. El porcentaje de préstamos en cartera vencida aumentó ligeramente. En el caso de créditos\ncomerciales, esto se debió en parte a los cambios en la metodología de contabilidad, por lo cual\nno puede atribuirse completamente al deterioro de la calidad del crédito.\nEstoy convencido de que el mayor problema que enfrenta México no es demasiado crédito, sino\nmuy poco. Es por eso que la reforma financiera recientemente implementada es tan importante; y\nes por eso que su objetivo principal es impulsar el crédito.\n6\n\n\fOtra ventaja que tiene México es la abundancia de reservas de divisas, cerca de $180 mil\nmillones de dólares, y una línea de crédito permanente de $73 mil millones de dólares con el\nFondo Monetario Internacional. México ha estado acumulando más reservas de divisas mientras\nque otras naciones de mercados emergentes las han visto decrecer.\nAunque el exceso de liquidez de Estados Unidos ha encontrado su destino en todos los mercados\nemergentes, hay un compromiso palpable de los inversionistas con México, que distingue a este\npaís de los demás. Llegando a más de $35 mil millones de dólares, 2013 fue un año récord para\nla inversión extranjera directa en México. La inversión extranjera directa se duplicó con respecto\na 2012, aunque una gran parte del aumento se debió a la adquisición del Grupo Modelo.\nMéxico es diferente. A partir de febrero, Moody’s subió la calificación de sus bonos\ngubernamentales a A3. De este modo, México se unió a Chile y es el segundo país\nlatinoamericano con una calificación de “A”. Las reformas estructurales que ha aprobado\nMéxico fueron claves para la nueva calificación, también ayudó la capacidad de México para\naprobarlas. Una voluntad política unificada que trabaje por lo que es mejor para la nación es muy\ndifícil de encontrar en estos días y es algo con lo que Washington sólo puede soñar por el\nmomento.\nEs posible que en otros países, como Brasil, estén yendo en la dirección opuesta. La economía de\nBrasil probablemente se contrajo en la segunda mitad de 2013 y las perspectivas para 2014 son la\nmitad del crecimiento proyectado de México para el año próximo. La desaceleración económica\nbrasileña ha ocurrido después de años de rápido crecimiento y aumento de los precios. Ahora hay\ntemores de una burbuja en el mercado inmobiliario en Brasil, por ejemplo el precio de las\nviviendas en Sao Paulo se ha triplicado desde 2008. En contraste, el precio de la vivienda en la\nCiudad de México ha aumentado un 35 por ciento.\nAclaro que no estoy pronosticando un desplome del mercado inmobiliario en la economía\nbrasileña. Pero los consumidores posiblemente tendrán que reducir sus niveles de deuda, lo que\nva en detrimento del crecimiento. Es posible que el gobierno también tenga que frenar los gastos.\nLa deuda del gobierno brasileño ha superado el crecimiento del producto interno bruto en los\núltimos años, y actualmente representa un 57 por ciento del producto interno bruto, casi el doble\nque la de México. Ante las perspectivas de un menor crecimiento y un debilitamiento del\nmercado laboral, los bancos brasileños probablemente restringirán los préstamos tras una década\nde expansión del crédito. Y en un momento en que el banco central normalmente tendría que\nrelajar la política monetaria para estimular la economía, necesita ahora una política más estricta\npara protegerse de la inflación.\nNo me preocupan tanto los ajustes cíclicos, me preocupan más los impedimentos estructurales\npara el crecimiento a largo plazo en Brasil. Durante esta época de extraordinaria liquidez y\ncrédito barato y, a pesar de una década caracterizada por el alto precio de las materias primas que\nexporta Brasil, el país no promovió más reformas de mercado. México, por el contrario, ha\nseguido aprovechando sus reformas anteriores, como el compromiso con el libre comercio a\ntravés de NAFTA (Tratado del Libre Comercio de America del Norte—TLCAN) y otros tratados\ncomerciales.\n\n7\n\n\fMéxico ha garantizado la apertura de su economía y ha asegurado la competitividad global de su\nsector manufacturero. Las exportaciones más las importaciones como porcentaje del producto\ninterno bruto de México alcanzaron el 64 por ciento en 2012, mientras que el comercio de Brasil\ncomo porcentaje del producto interno bruto (PIB) fue de tan sólo el 21 por ciento. México es\nahora el segundo exportador de automóviles a Estados Unidos después de Japón y ha sido el\nprimer exportador de autopartes desde 2001.\nLas reformas de México y el boom petrolero de Texas\nMéxico ha registrado en el último año impresionantes cambios estructurales. Su gobierno es un\nejemplo para muchos otros países, inclusive el mío.\nUna docena de proyectos de ley fueron aprobados por el Congreso y se convirtieron en ley en\n2013. Cinco de ellos requirieron cambios a la Constitución. Para poner esta hazaña en\nperspectiva, este gobierno ha logrado más en el último año que las tres administraciones\nanteriores juntas.\nMéxico ha renovado leyes en el sector laboral, educativo, y en el sector de telecomunicaciones,\nfinanzas y energía —incluyendo un plan para abrir el sector petrolero y de extracción de gas a la\ninversión privada. El momento es oportuno. La implementación de estas nuevas leyes coincidirá\ncon el fortalecimiento de la recuperación económica de Estados Unidos.\nUstedes saben mucho más que yo sobre estas reformas estructurales. No puedo pretender hablar\ncon autoridad sobre las implicaciones económicas detalladas de estas reformas, pero quiero\nofrecer mi punto de vista desde Texas. La aprobación el año pasado de la histórica reforma\nenergética, si se implementa cuidadosamente, incrementará la producción de petróleo y gas.\nRevertirá la tendencia de disminución de la producción de petróleo de los últimos nueve años,\nque actualmente está reduciendo las exportaciones, la producción industrial y el producto interno\nbruto (PIB) de México y afectando negativamente los ingresos gubernamentales.\nEl boom petrolero de Eagle Ford, en la región sur central de Texas, ejemplifica las diferencias en\nregulación entre nuestras dos regiones, que la reforma pretende solucionar. La diferencia es muy\nreveladora. Mientras que la actividad se ha acelerado dramáticamente al norte de la frontera en el\nlado de Estados Unidos, no hay ninguna perforación ni producción similar en el norte de México\na pesar de la geología contigua entre las dos naciones. Y no es porque Eagle Ford haya requerido\nlos vastos recursos de las grandes corporaciones petroleras. Por el contrario, los operadores\nindependientes son quienes han desarrollado la gran mayoría de los proyectos de Eagle Ford. El\nresultado es el pronunciado aumento de la producción de petróleo en Eagle Ford, de cero barriles\ndiarios hace cuatro años a más de 1.3 millones de barriles diarios en la actualidad.\nEl boom petrolero de Texas ha tenido efectos de gran alcance en todo el estado. Tan sólo Texas\nahora produce más petróleo que México y más gas que Canadá. Y aunque las industrias de\npetróleo y gas emplean directamente solamente el 2.5 por ciento de los trabajadores de Texas, el\nsector energético en conjunto representa más del 10 por ciento de producto interno bruto estatal.\nLas operaciones de nuestras refinerías de la costa del Golfo están en auge, y las exportaciones de\ngasolina y diesel se han disparado.\nAunque la economía de Texas está bien diversificada y ya no depende estereotípicamente de la\nenergía, la industria petrolera y de gas proporciona un ímpetu nada insignificante a la economía\n8\n\n\ftexana. También ayuda a diferenciarnos del resto de Estados Unidos, así como lo hace el enfoque\nque nuestro gobierno estatal le ha dado a la reglamentación y tributos que se aplican a las\nempresas.\nPara que se den una idea del diferencial de crecimiento con el resto del país, el empleo de Texas\nha crecido un 2.5 por ciento por año durante la recuperación económica, un punto porcentual por\nencima del aumento en el empleo a nivel nacional. El producto interno bruto estatal ha tenido un\ncrecimiento anual promedio del 4.2 por ciento desde el año 2009, en comparación con el 2.2 por\nciento en Estados Unidos. Las exportaciones de Texas han aumentado un 79 por ciento desde su\nnivel más bajo en 2009, en comparación con el 35 por ciento de aumento en el país.\nToda esta actividad económica finalmente está teniendo un impacto sobre los salarios, los cuales\nestán aumentando en Texas mientras siguen estancados en el resto del país. Como pueden\nimaginarse, las oportunidades de empleo y el aumento de los salarios han hecho que Texas sea el\nprincipal destino para la migración interna en el país. Desde 2006, Texas cuenta con un\npromedio de 150,000 recién llegados al año que se trasladan procedentes de otros estados de la\nunión americana. Esto se suma a la migración internacional, que sigue siendo alta, pero que ha\ndisminuido en comparación con el nivel de antes de la crisis.\nEsto es lo que veo venir para México. Las reformas estructurales –manejadas con buen juicio,\nespecialmente mientras el crecimiento económico de Estados Unidos se acelera y Europa se\nrecupera– pueden dar excelentes resultados para el pueblo mexicano, que se merece eso y mucho\nmás. Aunque México ha reducido en algo su dependencia del Estados Unidos, el 80 por ciento de\nlas exportaciones siguen yendo hacia el Norte. Podría ser útil, a corto o mediano plazo exportar a\nEstados Unidos y Europa productos manufacturados, mientras dichas regiones se recuperan\nlentamente, en lugar de exportar materias primas a China como lo ha venido haciendo Brasil en\nla última década.\nMéxico ha emergido\nComencé mi charla esta noche exponiendo los eventos, el trasfondo institucional y el\npensamiento detrás de los esfuerzos de la QE. Francamente no he estado de acuerdo con todas\nlas decisiones que ha tomado el FOMC durante la recuperación económica. Me temo que\nestamos fomentando desequilibrios similares a los que originaron la crisis financiera. Con sus\ncompras masivas de activos, la Reserva Federal está distorsionando los mercados financieros y\ncreando incentivos para que los gerentes y actores del mercado asuman mayores riesgos, algunos\nde los cuales pueden resultar en lágrimas. Y todo esto sucede en un territorio inexplorado.\nHemos ayudado a crear un enorme exceso de reservas bancarias sin tener un plan claro de cómo\nreducirlas cuando llegue el momento. Y enfrentamos el reto de hacerlo manteniendo estables las\nexpectativas de inflación.\nEstoy seguro que el FOMC encontrará formas factibles de normalizar el balance general de la\nReserva Federal. También creo que se encontrarán los mecanismos apropiados para evitar que el\naumento de la velocidad de circulación de la base monetaria a niveles previos a la crisis se\ntraduzca en presiones inflacionarias. No obstante, hay que seguir reduciendo las compras de\nactivos a gran escala a un ritmo mesurado que conduzca a la eliminación completa de dichas\ncompras tan pronto como sea posible.\n\n9\n\n\fY estoy seguro que a medida que retroceda la marea del dinero fácil, México estará listo para\ncontinuar con la siguiente etapa. A diferencia de otras naciones de mercados emergentes, México\naprovechó la oportunidad para tomar algunas decisiones difíciles y a consecuencia de ello ahora\nes más flexible y competitivo a nivel mundial. La estabilidad macroeconómica, la apertura al\ncomercio internacional y un compromiso unificado para encarar las fuerzas del mercado en lugar\nde huir de ellas, indican que la economía mexicana ya no es una economía emergente, sino que\nya ha emergido.\nPara mí, un hombre que pasó su infancia en México y que se siente mexicano, este es uno de los\nacontecimientos más gratificantes de mi vida. Entonces digo ¡Ándale pues, México!\n\n10\n\n\f"

Having Made the Tough Choices, Mexico\nStands to Benefit From Reforms and Navigate Fed’s\nTapering With Relative Ease\nRemarks before the Association of Mexican Banks\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nMexico City, Mexico\nMarch 5, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f¡Ándale Pues! Having Made the Tough Choices, Mexico\nStands to Benefit From Reforms and Navigate Fed’s\nTapering With Relative Ease\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Luis [Robles], for that kind introduction. It is my great pleasure to be here tonight as\nthe guest of the Association of Mexican Banks and reunited with my colleagues from Banco de\nMéxico. I recently returned from Europe, where I met with leaders from the European Central\nBank and the National Bank of Switzerland.\nI am very grateful to Governor Agustín Carstens for his hospitality. The Federal Reserve Bank of\nDallas has enjoyed a long history of cooperation and consultation with the Banco de México. I\nlike to call Banxico our sister bank. Agustín himself spent some time at the Dallas Fed when he\nwas a young man, and we take pride in playing this small part in his accomplished career. For\nmany years, the Dallas Fed’s El Paso Branch has held joint board meetings and informational\nexchanges with the Banco de México regional board of directors in Ciudad Juárez. Now our\nbranches in Houston and San Antonio are holding similar joint meetings with their Banco de\nMéxico counterparts. And Governor Carstens’ predecessor, Guillermo Ortiz, is an advisory\nboard member of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México enjoy a unique and mutually beneficial\nrelationship.\nAs Guillermo and Agustín well know, there is also a personal dimension to the Dallas Fed’s\nrelationship with the Banco de México. I grew up in Mexico City in the 1950s, attending\nelementary school not far from here. Spanish was my first language in school. To this day, I have\nmany friends in El Norte who say I speak better Spanish than I do English, although that may be\ndue to my Texas accent. Either way, I always proudly tell them, “¡No hablo español; hablo puro\nmexicano!” This evening, I will do my level best to speak to you in español mexicano rather than\nin inglés texano.\nUnprecedented U.S. Monetary Policy\nAs you surely know, and as I am happy to report, the Federal Open Market Committee (the\n“FOMC”), charged with crafting U.S. monetary policy, is winding down its extraordinary\n“quantitative easing” phase. The Great Recession demanded extraordinary policy, and the\nFOMC responded. Led by Chairman Bernanke, the FOMC met the financial crisis head-on in\nSeptember 2007 and by the end of 2008 had lowered the federal funds rate to zero from 5.25\npercent.\nOnce the full force of the financial crisis hit, after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the federal\nfunds tool proved insufficient. First individual companies had to be rescued, then the banking\nsystem, and eventually the whole economy. Conventional thought held that there was little that\npolicymakers could do after reaching the zero bound—when the central bank’s policy rate hit\nzero. But the FOMC thought otherwise.\n\n1\n\n\fBy mid-2009, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. began to recover after contracting\n4.3 percent. Progress was painfully slow. GDP eked out 1.3 percent growth in the third quarter\nand put the U.S. back on a growth path. Meanwhile, the labor market lagged. The unemployment\nrate was 9.6 percent, employment growth was still out of reach, and real wages were falling. The\nlabor market is central to FOMC deliberations. While most other central banks, including Banco\nde México, are legally bound to only ensure price stability, U.S. policymakers are charged with a\ndual mandate: ensuring price stability and maximum employment. By the middle of 2009, the\njobs deficit (jobs lost since the prerecession peak in employment) was 8 million and rising.\nThus, we embarked on an aggressive path of quantitative easing (QE), launching large-scale\npurchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and U.S. housing agency debt. The\nfirst round of QE ran until March 2010, when the labor market had finally started recovering. By\nthe conclusion of QE1, the Fed had infused the economy with $1.25 trillion in liquidity. Second\nand third rounds of quantitative easing were announced in November 2010 and September 2012,\nrespectively.\nBy the time the Fed began tapering the pace of these asset purchases in December of 2013, the\nFed’s balance sheet had ballooned from below $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion in just four\nyears. Today, the Federal Reserve has an unprecedented volume and diversity of assets.\nCorrespondingly, banks hold an unprecedented amount of reserves. Total reserves at depository\ninstitutions have skyrocketed from $45 billion before the crisis to $2.5 trillion today. The stock\nof bank reserves awaiting discharge into the economy through our banking system is vast and,\ntroublingly, mostly unused.\nThere is plenty of money available for American businesses to work with. Consider this: In\nfourth quarter 2007, U.S. GDP was $14.7 trillion; at year-end 2013 it was an estimated $17.1\ntrillion. Had we continued on the path we were on before the crisis, real GDP would currently be\nroughly $20 trillion in size. That’s a third larger than it was in 2007. Yet the amount of money\ngoing unused in the banking system is 60 times greater now than at year-end 2007. It isn’t a lack\nof liquidity that is keeping businesses from putting people back to work.\nMoney’s Cheap and Abundant, Yet the Recovery Disappoints\nThe Federal Reserve has created an opportunity for others to act. Money is cheap and plentiful.\nThe objective now is for banks to lend, consumers to borrow, and businesses to invest so jobs are\ncreated and economic activity expands. With such aggressive monetary policy, it is surprising\nthat the economic recovery has languished. Notwithstanding recent data that show consumers are\nborrowing again, four and a half years into the economic recovery, employment still has not\nreached its prerecession level, making this by far the slowest of the 12 post-World War II U.S.\nrecoveries.\nOne problem has been the sluggish pace of the recovery in the other advanced economies. The\nfinancial crisis was a global phenomenon, affecting advanced and emerging market economies\nalike. Yet the emerging market economies bounced back and in almost all cases have long since\nsurpassed their precrisis levels of output. This has not been the case in the advanced economies.\nEurope and the euro zone, which have been hobbled by a series of sovereign debt crises in the\nwake of the financial crisis and the adoption of a single currency, remain important to the global\neconomy, and problems there cannot help but have international repercussions. The good news is\n2\n\n\fthat European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi’s pledge in 2012 to “do whatever it\ntakes” to stabilize the situation there seems to have worked and to have bought time for muchneeded reforms. In conversations with President Draghi and the ECB governors last Friday, it\nwas clear that recent data suggest the worst may be over.\nMeanwhile, in Japan, “Abenomics” seems to be succeeding in ending the decades-long deflation,\nthough progress on structural reforms—crucial to restoring long-term growth—has been\ndisappointing. There is an important lesson here, one to which I will return later: Monetary\npolicy can only do so much. In the case of Japan, monetary policy can end the deflation that has\ncharacterized the economy since the late 1990s, but can do little to infuse long-run expansion\nunless it is accompanied by fiscal policy that implements structural change.\nBut the biggest problem the U.S. confronts is homegrown: political failure in Washington to act\non the key issues holding the recovery hostage. Fiscal and regulatory uncertainty is a powerful\ndeterrent to business investment. Going back to the earliest days of the current recovery, my\nbusiness contacts have regularly complained of the fog of uncertainty emanating from\nWashington. They have consistently cited fiscal and regulatory uncertainty as major\nimpediments to capital investment and expanding payrolls.\nUncertainty comes in many forms. In some cases it is major legislation such as the health care\nreform or financial regulation as in the Dodd Frank [Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection] Act. Fiscal issues have regularly constrained the recovery—the debt ceiling debacle\nin summer 2011, the last-minute resolution of the fiscal cliff in December 2012, the brute force\nsequester of 2013 and so on. Most vexing is not knowing how businesses will be taxed or how\nthe federal government will shape future spending. This makes budgeting and planning capital\noutlays and payrolls into the future an uncertain process.\nIt is my personal opinion that the Fed has bought time for fiscal authorities to get their house in\norder, but four years later I am not sure we are much closer to that goal. It is true that\nWashington politicians stopped bickering long enough in December to pass a budget, the first\nbudget in four years. And the projected budget deficit is just 3 percent of GDP this fiscal year,\ndown from 4.1 percent in 2013 and 7 percent in 2012. After five years of outsized deficits, the\nU.S. is finally on par with Mexico, whose deficit throughout the recovery never exceeded 2.8\npercent of GDP.\nYou might think that agreeing on a budget means the U.S. government can go about its business,\ntaxing and spending and keeping the monuments open to tourists. But in the U.S. we have\nanother obstacle, the debt ceiling. This ritual battle, which we have fought at least 87 times since\nthe end of World War II, does not address the underlying imbalances at the root of our fiscal\nsituation. Nevertheless, we revisit it regularly and did so in February when Congress actually\napproved raising the debt ceiling without a big fight. Last time, you may recall, things did not go\nso smoothly. The stock markets wobbled, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued\nwarnings, and one of the credit rating agencies downgraded U.S. government debt.\nThe debt ceiling may be well-intentioned and put in place to protect our children from our own\nand prior generations’ excesses, but it has been completely ineffectual in stopping rising debt and\nmay be contributing to the uncertainty that is holding up the recovery. U.S. debt held by the\npublic has ballooned to 76 percent of GDP, up from 36 percent in 2007. The U.S. is nearing\n3\n\n\fdebt-to-GDP ratios not seen since the aftermath of World War II. In contrast, Mexico’s debt is\nrelatively small, about 30 percent of GDP, although it too has increased, and is up from 20\npercent in 2007.\nHere in Mexico as in the U.S., the recession worsened the fiscal situation by depressing tax\nrevenues while spending rose. That said, the nations’ trajectories are quite different. While the\ngrowth of U.S. government debt has temporarily slowed, longer-term factors are expected to\npush the debt-to-GDP ratio to 100 percent by 2038 from where it will likely continue rising.\nMexico’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall once the recently passed fiscal reform is fully\nimplemented.\nThis era of unprecedented liquidity and low interest rates has presented the U.S. with at least\nthree great opportunities:\nOne was to address the long-term fiscal outlook by reforming entitlement programs such as\nSocial Security and Medicare. We must create a balanced system that will prevent future\nliabilities from spiraling out of control.\nA second was to pass regulatory reforms to lessen the risk of future financial-market crises and\nensure too-big-to-fail entities never again place the U.S. in a position where taxpayer funds must\nbe used to bail out bad private-sector actors.\nA third was to restructure government debt while long-term rates are at historic lows. Within the\nnext four years, 58 percent of U.S. government debt will mature. And though short-term rates are\nlow now, they won’t be low forever. When the existing debt matures, rates are sure to be higher\nand servicing the debt will take a bigger share out of the budget, leaving less to spend on\neverything else. One sobering statistic is that net interest payments on the debt are scheduled to\nnearly triple by the end of the decade, rising from $221 billion in fiscal year 2013 (1.3 percent of\nGDP) to $635 billion in fiscal year 2020 (2.8 percent of GDP).\nI would say that this era of cheap money is one of missed opportunities on all three of these\nfronts. To add insult to injury, there are increasing signs quantitative easing has overstayed its\nwelcome: Market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive.\nStock market metrics such as price to projected forward earnings, price-to-sales ratios and\nmarket capitalization as a percentage of GDP are at eye-popping levels not seen since the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. In the words of James Mackintosh, writer of the Financial Times\ncolumn “The Short View,” a not insignificant number of stocks in the S&P 500 have valuations\n“that rely on belief in a financial fairy.” Margin debt is pushing up against all-time records. And,\nin the bond market, narrow spreads between corporate and Treasury debt reflect lower risk\npremia on top of already abnormally low nominal yields. We must monitor these indicators very\ncarefully so as to ensure that the ghost of “irrational exuberance” does not haunt us again.\nQE Spillovers\nAs you well know, the effects of unprecedented monetary easing in the U.S. and other advanced\neconomies do not stop at international borders. They spill over onto the rest of the world.\nRecord-low interest rates engineered by central bankers have led investors to seek higher returns\nelsewhere, generating massive inflows of capital into emerging market economies (EME),\n4\n\n\fincluding Mexico. Let’s not forget that capital flows to EMEs were large even before the crisis.\nThat said, they rose further as quantitative easing gained momentum in the U.S. and other\nnations adopted similar policies. For example, U.S. capital stock as a share of home-country\nGDP rose from 11 percent to 17 percent in Brazil and from 18 percent to 25 percent in Mexico\nbetween 2008 and 2012. Capital flows were increasingly made up of portfolio investment rather\nthan direct investment during this time.\nNews of Fed tapering in late spring last year reversed the flow of capital into EME-dedicated\nequity and bond funds, and emerging market currencies depreciated against the dollar. Sovereign\ndebt yields rose sharply in vulnerable emerging market nations such as Brazil and Turkey.\nSovereign debt spreads edged up in Mexico also, but significantly less so than in other EMEs.\nMuch like in the morning after a party the night before, investors woke up sober and more\ndiscriminating.\nWhy Mexico Stands Apart\nThere are concerns that the outsized capital flows to EMEs during the QE era pushed down\ninterest rates and led consumers and businesses to take on too much debt. Mexico seems better\npositioned than many other countries in terms of this risk exposure. While according to the\nBanco de Mexico, private lending is up 38 percent since its recession low in 2010, international\ncomparisons based on World Bank figures show the rate of credit expansion in Mexico pales in\ncomparison to other emerging market nations. Between 2009 and 2012, private lending as a\nshare of GDP grew 5 percentage points in Mexico while jumping 20 percentage points in Brazil.\nThe level of debt exposure is also lower in Mexico than in many other emerging market nations.\nPrivate lending as a share of GDP was 28 percent in Mexico in 2012, compared with 35 percent\nin Indonesia, 54 percent in Turkey and 68 percent in Brazil.\nOn my flight home from Zurich, I read about a bank with compliance failures; however, I have\nto say that as a whole, the Mexican banking system is quite healthy. Bank profits rose in 2013\nand Mexican banks are well-capitalized, with an aggregate capital ratio of 16 percent as of yearend 2013. While four small banks failed year-end stress tests by the Comision Nacional Bancaria\ny de Valores (CNBV) and were asked to boost capital and diversify their portfolios, it was also\nthe first year the regulator fully implemented the stringent Basel III capital rules. The share of\nnonperforming loans rose slightly; among commercial loans, this was partly due to changes in\nthe accounting methodology, so it cannot fully be attributed to deteriorating credit quality.\nI am convinced that the biggest problem facing Mexico is not too much credit, but too little.\nThat’s why the recently implemented financial reform is so important; that’s why its core\nobjective is to boost credit.\nAnother advantage that Mexico has is plentiful foreign exchange reserves, about $180 billion,\nand a $73 billion standing line of credit with the IMF. Mexico has been amassing more foreign\nexchange reserves as other emerging market nations have seen them dwindle.\nWhile excess liquidity from the U.S. has found its way to all emerging markets, there is a\npalpable investor commitment to Mexico that sets it apart from the rest. At over $35 billion,\n2013 was a record year for foreign direct investment in Mexico. Foreign direct investment\ndoubled over 2012, although a large portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of Grupo\nModelo.\n5\n\n\fMexico stands apart. As of February, Moody’s boosted its rating on Mexico’s government bonds\nto A3—joining Chile as only the second Latin American country with an “A” rating. The\nstructural reforms Mexico has passed played a role, but so did the ability to pass them. A unified\npolitical will to work for what’s in the nation’s best interests is a rare find these days and\nsomething about which Washington can only dream.\nOther nations, such as Brazil, may be headed in the opposite direction. Brazil’s economy likely\nshrank in the second half of 2013 and prospects for 2014 are half of what Mexico’s growth is\nprojected to be next year. The Brazilian slowdown follows years of rapid growth and rising\nprices. Now, there are fears of a Brazilian house price bubble—homes in Sao Paulo are selling at\nthree times 2008 prices. In contrast, Mexico City house prices are up 35 percent.\nI am not forecasting a housing bust for the Brazilian economy, mind you. But consumers may\nhave to deleverage, which will detract from growth. The government may have to rein in\nspending as well. Brazilian government debt has outpaced GDP growth in recent years and\ncurrently stands at 57 percent of GDP, nearly twice that of Mexico. Faced with poorer growth\nprospects and a weakening labor market, Brazilian banks will likely tighten lending after a\ndecade of credit expansion. And at a time that the central bank would normally need to loosen\npolicy to stimulate the economy, it needs tighter policy to ward off inflation.\nI am not as concerned about cyclical adjustments as I am about structural impediments to longrun growth in Brazil. During this time of remarkable liquidity and cheap credit, and despite a\ndecade of high commodity prices and booming exports, Brazil failed to advance further market\nreforms. Mexico, on the other hand, has continued to build on its earlier reforms such as its\ncommitment to free trade through NAFTA and other trade agreements. Mexico has secured the\nopenness of its economy and ensured the global competitiveness of its manufacturing sector.\nExports plus imports as a share of Mexico GDP reached 64 percent in 2012 while Brazil’s trade\nshare of GDP was just 21 percent. Mexico is now the No. 2 exporter of auto vehicles to the U.S.\nafter Japan and has been the top exporter of auto parts since 2001.\nMexico Reforms and the Texas Shale Oil Boom\nMexico in the last year has logged impressive structural change. Your government stands as an\nexample for many other nations, including my own.\nA dozen reform bills passed Congress and were signed into law in 2013, five requiring\nconstitutional amendments. To put this feat in perspective, this government has accomplished\nmore in the last year than the three preceding administrations combined.\nMexico has revamped labor laws, the education system and its telecommunications system,\nfinancial and energy sectors—including a plan to open up its oil and gas sector to private\ninvestment. The timing is good. The implementation of these new laws will coincide with a\nstrengthening U.S. economic recovery.\nYou know far more about these structural reforms than I do. I cannot pretend to speak with any\nauthority on the detailed economic implications of these reforms, but I do want to offer some\nperspective from Texas. Last year’s passage of the historic energy reform should, if carefully and\ndeliberately implemented, increase oil and gas production and reverse the nine-year trend of\n6\n\n\fdeclining output that is currently depressing Mexico exports, industrial production and GDP and\nadversely impacting government revenues.\nThe Eagle Ford shale oil boom in south central Texas exemplifies the regulatory differences\nbetween our two regions that the reform aspires to relinquish. The gap is very telling. As activity\nhas accelerated dramatically north of the border, there is no corresponding drilling or production\nin northern Mexico despite the contiguous geology. And it’s not because Eagle Ford required the\ndeep pockets of the huge energy corporations. Rather, it is largely independent operators who\nhave developed the vast majority of Eagle Ford projects. The result: sharply rising oil production\nin the Eagle Ford, from nothing four years ago to more than 1.3 million barrels per day currently.\nThe shale oil boom in Texas has had far-reaching effects on the state. Texas alone now produces\nmore oil than Mexico, more gas than Canada. While oil and gas industries directly employ only\n2.5 percent of Texas workers, the energy sector as a whole accounts for over 10 percent of\nannual output. Downstream operations—our Gulf Coast refineries—are booming, and gasoline\nand diesel exports have skyrocketed.\nWhile the Texas economy is well diversified and no longer stereotypically dependent on energy,\noil and gas provides a not insignificant impetus to the Texas economy and helps differentiate us\nfrom the rest of the United States, as does our state government’s approach to pro-business\nregulation and taxation. To give you an idea of the growth differential with the rest of the nation,\nTexas employment has grown 2.5 percent per year during the economic recovery, which is about\na percentage point faster than the nation. State GDP has averaged 4.2 percent annual average\ngrowth since 2009, compared with 2.2 percent in the U.S. Texas exports have increased 79\npercent since their low in 2009, compared with 35 percent in the nation.\nAll this economic activity is finally spilling over into wages, which are rising in Texas as they\nremain flat in the rest of the nation. As you can imagine, job opportunities and rising\ncompensation have made Texas the No. 1 destination for interstate moves in the country. Since\n2006, Texas has averaged 150,000 newcomers per year who are relocating from other states.\nThis is in addition to international migration, which is still high but has decreased from where it\nwas before the crisis.\nThis is what I see for Mexico. Structural reforms—handled judiciously, especially as U.S.\neconomic growth accelerates and Europe recovers—can pay off in spades for the Mexican\npeople, who deserve it many times over. While Mexico has somewhat reduced its dependence on\nthe U.S., 80 percent of exports still go to El Norte. In a strange twist of fate, it may be helpful in\nthe near to medium term to be exporting manufactured goods to a slowly recovering U.S. and\nEurope rather than maintain the last decade’s shipments of raw materials to China as in the case\nof Brazil.\nMexico Has Emerged\nI began my talk tonight by running through the events, institutional backdrop and the thinking\nbehind the Fed’s quantitative easing efforts. I clearly have not been onboard with all the\ndecisions the FOMC has taken during the economic recovery. I fear that we are feeding\nimbalances similar to those that played a role in the run-up to the financial crisis. With its\nmassive asset purchases, the Fed is distorting financial markets and creating incentives for\nmanagers and market players to take increasing risk, some of which may result in tears. And all\n7\n\n\fthis is happening in uncharted territory. We have aided creation of massive excess bank reserves\nwithout a clear plan for how to drain them when the time comes. And there is the challenge of\ndoing so while keeping inflation expectations stable.\nNevertheless, I believe that the FOMC will find practicable ways to normalize the Fed’s balance\nsheet. I believe that practicable ways will be found to avoid inflationary pressures once the\nvelocity of money returns to precrisis levels. I certainly believe that continuing to pare back on\nthe amount of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases is a good start and should be continued at a\nmeasured pace that leads to their complete elimination as soon as is practicable.\nAnd I believe that as the tide of easy money recedes, Mexico stands ready for the next phase.\nUnlike other emerging market nations, Mexico seized the opportunity to make some tough\ndecisions and is more resilient and globally competitive as a result. Macroeconomic stability,\nopenness to trade and a unified commitment to confront rather than run from market forces\nindicate that the Mexican economy is no longer an emerging economy; it has emerged. For this\nman who spent his childhood in Mexico and feels Mexican, this is one of the most gratifying\ndevelopments of my lifetime. So that’s why I say, ¡Ándale pues, México!\n\n8\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAustin, Texas\nFebruary 21, 2014\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fExcerpts From “A Conversation About\nLonghorns, Longnecks and Liquidity:\nThe Economy and the Course of Monetary Policy\nRichard W. Fisher\nTexans drink a lot of beer—34.4 gallons per person in 2012 or the equivalent of 367 longnecks\nin a year 1—so it may not come as a surprise to you that beer and money are inextricably linked.\nAbout the same time our ancient forefathers invented beer some 10,000 years ago, rudimentary\nmoney emerged on the scene in the then-dominant kingdom of Lydia. Of course, the law of\nunintended consequences also took root to create another of man’s notorious developments: beer\ngoggles!\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the term “beer goggles,” the Urban Dictionary defines it as “the\neffect that alcohol … has in rendering a person who one would ordinarily regard as unattractive\nas … alluring.” While this Forty-Acres Scholar audience might substitute Tito’s Vodka or a\nChuy’s margarita for “longneck,” the effect is the same: Things often look better when one is\nunder the influence of free-flowing liquidity. If you don’t believe me, just visit Sixth Street\ntonight.\nThis is a major theme of my remarks here today. No, not longnecks or other free-flowing\nlibations specifically, but the concept that too much liquidity can be a very dangerous thing.\nWilliam McChesney Martin, the longest-serving Fed chairman in our institution’s 100-year\nhistory, famously said that the Fed’s job is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets\ngoing.\n… In the remainder of my time with you here today, I will speak briefly about the operations of\nthe Dallas Fed and of the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks. Then I am going to comment on the\nTexas economic recovery and speak extemporaneously on recent policy decisions taken by the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Finally, I am going to make a brief comment on the\ndepth of the punchbowl of liquidity the Fed has created, the reason I have advocated removing it,\nand the sobering reality of the fiscal folly of our lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\n… For far too long, the greatest obstacle to the nation’s economic prosperity has resided here:\n\n1\n\n\fA straight-talker with a little salt on his tongue might be tempted to say: “It is fiscal policy that is\nleading to the Californication of our national economy rather than its Texification.” But I would\nnot say anything so crude, so I am not going to say it. Instead, I’ll invoke an editorial in a recent\nFinancial Times that said it more politely: “Fiscal policy is still not an ally of U.S. growth.”\nThis is a picture of the gaping hole in the heart of our nation’s prosperity: If you remove the jobcreating machine of Texas from the U.S. economy, the nation has experienced job destruction\nthat has occurred over the past 12 years in the middle-income quartiles.\n\n2\n\n\fJob Growth by Wage Quartile,\n2000-12\nPercent change\n35\n\n31.0\n\n30.3\n\n30\nTexas\n\n25\n20\n\nU.S. minus Texas\n\n18.6\n\n15\n10\n\n9.7\n\n10.4\n\n9.9\n\n5\n\n0.9\n\n0\n-5\n-6.9\n\n-10\nLowest wage quartile\n\nLower-middle wage\nquartile\n\nUpper-middle wage\nquartile\n\nHighest wage quartile\n\nNOTES: Calculations include workers over age 15 with positive wages and exclude the self-employed. Wage\nquartiles constructed based on U.S. 2000 wage distribution.\nSOURCE: Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups, 2000, 2012.\n\nI never refer to “classes”; I do not believe status in a democracy should be defined by the\nhidebound concept of “classes.” But no matter: The most vital organ of our nation’s economy—\nthe middle-income worker—is being eviscerated.\nThis is the pathology I worry most about. So I ask: Can my colleagues and I at the Fed cure this\nwith monetary policy? Obviously, businesses cannot create jobs without the means for investing\nin job-creating expansion, so, yes, monetary policy is necessary to propel job creation.\nBut as I have shown this afternoon, the store of bank reserves awaiting discharge into the\neconomy through our banking system is vast, yet it lies fallow. Take a look at this chart of total\nreserves of depository institutions: They have ballooned from a precrisis level of $43 billion to\nmore than $2.5 trillion.\n\n3\n\n\fBank Reserves Have Ballooned\nBillions, Reserves ($)\n3000\n\nTotal Reserves of Depository Institutions\n\n2,540\n\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n43\n0\n'07\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\n'14\n\nSOURCES: Federal Reserve Board of Governors, H.3 release.\n\nHere is the point: There is plenty of money available for businesses to work with. Consider this:\nIn fourth quarter 2007 the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $14.7 trillion; at year-end\n2013 it was estimated to be $17.1 trillion. Had we continued on the path we were on before the\ncrisis, GDP would currently be roughly $20 trillion in size. That’s a third larger than it was in\n2007. Yet the amount of money lying fallow in the banking system is 60 times greater now than\nit was at year-end 2007. One is hard pressed to argue that there is insufficient money available\nfor businesses to put people back to work.\nNow, bear in mind that we at the Fed only control the monetary base (cash plus bank reserves),\nnot the velocity with which money is used. Again, consider this graph:\n\n4\n\n\fNewly Created Money Mostly\nSitting Fallow as Excess Reserves\nTrillions of dollars\n4.0\nExcess reserves\n3.5\n\nRequired reserves\n\n3.0\n\nJan. 2014\n$3.73T\nMonetary\nBase\n\nNon-bank currency\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\nDec. 2007\n$0.84T\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n'03\n\n'04\n\n'05\n\n'06\n\n'07\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\n'14\n\nSOURCES: Federal Reserve Board; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOver the past six years, the monetary base has increased 340 percent, 10 times the rate at which\nthe economy would have expanded in nominal terms had we not suffered the recent recession.\nOne is hard pressed to argue that there is much efficacy derived from additional expansion of the\nFed’s balance sheet. This is why I’ve been such a strong proponent of dialing back our\nlarge-scale asset purchases and will continue advocating that we do so.\nIt is my firm belief that the fault in our economy lies not in monetary policy but in a reckless and\nfeckless federal government that simply cannot get its fiscal and regulatory policy geared so as to\nencourage business to take the copious amount of money we at the Fed have created and put it to\nwork creating jobs and growing our economy. Fiscal policy is not only “not an ally of U.S.\ngrowth,” it is its enemy. If the fiscal and regulatory authorities that you elect and put into office\nto craft taxes, spending and regulations do not focus their efforts on providing incentives for\nbusinesses to expand job-creating capital investment rather than bicker with each other for\npartisan purposes, our economy will continue to fall short and the middle-income worker will\ncontinue being victimized, no matter how much money the Fed puts into the system.\nI don’t want to ruin your lunch after such pleasant talk of longnecks and liquidity, but if you\nwish to know who is at fault for hollowing out the welfare of middle-income workers and the\nAmerican economy, kindly do not look at me or my colleagues at the Fed. When you go home or\ntake a break during today’s conference, look at yourself in the mirror, for you elect our fiscal and\nregulatory policymakers. Many of you give money to finance the campaigns of candidates from\nout-of-state: Texas is a treasure trove of campaign finance for both Republicans and Democrats\nrunning for national office. We at the Fed are providing more than enough monetary\naccommodation. It is time for fiscal policymakers to do their job, to ally themselves with us to\nachieve a fully employed, prosperous America.\n\n5\n\n\fIn addition to being proud Longhorns and prosperous Texans, be bold Americans. Only you, as\nvoters, have the power to insist that our lawmakers craft policies that are needed to restore\nAmerican prosperity. Please do so.\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nSee “Report: Texans Drink a Lot of Beer—34.4 Gallons per Person in 2012,” by Tiney Ricciardi, Dallas\nMorning News, July 9, 2013.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, George [Jones]. George is a great member of the Dallas Fed board of\ndirectors, and I am honored he would take the time to introduce me. Waylon Jennings\nsaid of your namesake that “if we could all sound like we wanted to, we’d all sound like\nGeorge Jones.”1 I often feel that way about George at our board meetings. He gives a\nsharp, crisp, spot-on briefing of banking conditions in that deep, beautiful voice of his\nand I always think: I want to be just like George when I grow up. Again, thank you\nGeorge for that kind introduction.\nDuring the holiday break, I spent a good deal of time trying to organize my thoughts on\nhow I will approach monetary policy going forward. Today, I am going to share some of\nthose thoughts that might be of interest to you as corporate directors.\nAt the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it was decided that\nthe amount of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) we have been\npurchasing should each be pared back by $5 billion, so that we would be purchasing a\ntotal of $75 billion a month (in addition to reinvesting the proceeds of maturing issues we\nhold) rather than $85 billion per month. In addition, it was noted that “if incoming\ninformation broadly supports the Committee’s expectation(s) … the Committee will\nlikely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.”\nAnd it was made clear that the FOMC expects it will hold the base rate that anchors the\nyield curve—the federal funds rate, or the rate on overnight money—to its present nearzero rate well past the time when unemployment is reduced to 6½ percent.\nI was pleased with the decision to finally begin tapering our bond purchases, though I\nwould have preferred to pull back our purchases by double the announced amount. But\nthe important thing for me is that the committee began the process of slowing down the\nballooning of our balance sheet, which at year-end exceeded $4 trillion. And we began—\nand I use that word deliberately, for we have more to do on this front—to clarify our\nintentions for managing the overnight money rate.\nAs an economist would say, “on net” I was rather pleased with the decision taken at the\nDecember FOMC meeting.\nUnder the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, all 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents,\ntogether with the sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board, have input into the\ndecision-making process. There is a formal vote—regardless of who is the Fed chair—\nthat includes only five of the 12 regional Bank presidents plus the governors, but all of\n\n\fthe principals seated at the table participate fully in the discussion of what to do. And yet,\neither because we will effect a change in the chairmanship starting in February or because\nat the last meeting we took the step of tapering back by a small amount our massive\npurchase of Treasuries and MBS, great attention is being placed on the voters for 2014,\nof which I am one.\nTwo comments I recently read have been buzzing around my mind as I think about the\nmany issues that will condition my actions as a voter.\nBeer Goggles …\nThe first was by Peter Boockvar, who is among the plethora of analysts offering different\nviewpoints that I regularly read to get a sense of how we are being viewed in the\nmarketplace. Here is a rather pungent quote from a note he sent out on Jan. 2:\n“…QE [quantitative easing] puts beer goggles on investors by creating a line of sight\nwhere everything looks good…”\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the term “beer goggles,” the Urban Dictionary defines it\nas “the effect that alcohol … has in rendering a person who one would ordinarily regard\nas unattractive as … alluring.” This audience might substitute “wine” or “martini” or\n“margarita” for “beer” to make it more age-appropriate, but the effect is the same: Things\noften look better when one is under the influence of free-flowing liquidity. This is one\nreason why William McChesney Martin, the longest-serving Fed chairman in our\ninstitution’s 100-year history, famously said that the Fed’s job is to take away the\npunchbowl just as the party gets going.2\n… and the Eye of the Needle\nThe other eye catcher for me was a cartoon in the Jan. 6 issue of The New Yorker. Sitting\nin a room are two businessmen who are apparently conversant with the New Testament’s\nbook of Matthew. One says to the other, “We need either bigger needles or smaller\ncamels.”\nToday, I want to muse aloud about whether QE has indeed put beer goggles on investors\nand whether we, the Fed, can pass the camel of massive quantitative easing through the\neye of the needle of normalizing monetary policy without creating havoc.\nFree and Abundant Money Changes Perspective\nBoockvar is right. When money available to investors is close to free and is widely\navailable, and there is a presumption that the central bank will keep it that way\nindefinitely, discount rates applied to assessing the value of future cash flows shift\ndownward, making for lower hurdle rates for valuations. A bull market for stocks and\nother claims on tradable companies ensues; the financial world looks rather comely.\nMarket operators donning beer goggles and even some sober economists consider\nanalysts like Boockvar party poopers. But I have found myself making arguments similar\nto his and to those of other skeptics at recent FOMC meetings, pointing to some\n\n\fdevelopments that signal we have made for an intoxicating brew as we have continued\npouring liquidity down the economy’s throat.\nAmong them:\n•\n\nShare buybacks financed by debt issuance that after tax treatment and inflation\nincur minimal, and in some cases negative, cost; this has a most pleasant effect on\nearnings per share apart from top-line revenue growth.\n\n•\n\nDividend payouts financed by cheap debt that bolster share prices.\n\n•\n\nThe “bull/bear spread” for equities now being higher than in October 2007.\n\n•\n\nStock market metrics such as price-to-sales ratios and market capitalization as a\npercentage of gross domestic product at eye-popping levels not seen since the dotcom boom of the late 1990s.\n\n•\n\nMargin debt that is pushing up against all-time records.\n\n•\n\nIn the bond market, investment-grade yield spreads over “risk free” government\nbonds becoming abnormally tight.\n\n•\n\n“Covenant lite” lending becoming robust and the spread between CCC credit and\ninvestment-grade credit or the risk-free rate historically narrow. I will note here\nthat I am all for helping businesses get back on their feet so that they can expand\nemployment and America’s prosperity: This is the root desire of the FOMC. But I\nworry when “junk” companies that should borrow at a premium reflecting their\nrisk of failure are able to borrow (or have their shares priced) at rates that defy the\nodds of that risk. I may be too close to this given my background. From 1989\nthrough 1997, I was managing partner of a fund that bought distressed debt, used\nour positions to bring about changes in the companies we invested in, and made a\nhandsome profit from the dividends, interest payments and stock price\nappreciation that flowed from the restructured companies. Today, I would have to\nhire Sherlock Holmes to find a single distressed company priced attractively\nenough to buy.\n\nAnd then there are the knock-on effects of all of the above. Market operators are once\nagain spending money freely outside of their day jobs. An example: For almost 40 years,\nI have spent a not insignificant portion of my savings collecting rare, first-edition books.\nLike any patient investor in any market, I have learned through several market cycles that\nyou buy when nobody wants something and sell when everyone clamors for more.\nDuring the financial debacle of 2007–09, I was able to buy for a song volumes I have\nlong coveted (including a mint-condition first printing from 1841 of Mackay’s Memoirs\nof Extraordinary Popular Delusions, which every one of you should read and re-read,\ncertainly if you are contemplating seeing the movie The Wolf of Wall Street). Today, I\ncould not afford them. First editions, like paintings, sculptures, fine wines, Bugattis and\n\n\fhomes in Highland Park or River Oaks, have become the by-product of what I am sure\nBill Martin would consider a party well underway.\nI want to make clear that I am not among those who think we are presently in a “bubble”\nmode for stocks or bonds or most other assets. But this much I know: Just as Martin knew\nby virtue of his background as a noneconomist who had hands-on Wall Street experience,\nmarkets for anything tradable overshoot and one must be prepared for adjustments that\nbring markets back to normal valuations.\nThis need not threaten the real economy. The “slow correction” of 1962 comes to mind as\nan example: A stock market correction took place, and yet the economy continued to fare\nwell.\nHere is the point as to the market’s beer goggles. Were a stock market correction to ensue\nwhile I have the vote, I would not flinch from supporting continued reductions in the size\nof our asset purchases as long as the real economy is growing, cyclical unemployment is\ndeclining and demand-driven deflation remains a small tail risk; I would vote for\ncontinued reductions in our asset purchases, with an eye toward eliminating them entirely\nat the earliest practicable date.\nHow Large Is the Camel?\nLet’s turn to the camel, by which I mean the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.\nA little history provides some perspective. We began to grow our balance sheet as we\napproached year-end 2008. On Sept. 10, 2008, the amount of Reserve Bank credit\noutstanding was $867 billion. On Nov. 25, 2008, we announced a program to purchase\n$100 billion of securities issued by the housing-related government-sponsored\nenterprises, together with our intent to purchase up to $500 billion in MBS in order to\ngoose the housing market. I supported these initiatives, recognizing that the economy was\nin the throes of a financial panic.\nFollowing our December 2008 meeting, the FOMC announced that it had cut the target\nrange for the fed funds rate to 0-to-1/4 of 1 percent, and being thus “zero bound,” we\nfloated the idea of purchasing longer-term Treasuries in order to provide further monetary\naccommodation (when we buy Treasuries or MBS and agency debt, we put money into\nthe financial system, substituting for further interest rate cuts). On March 18, 2009, we\nannounced additional purchases of up to $750 billion of agency MBS and up to $100\nbillion of agency debt, plus purchases of up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury\nsecurities over six months. That day, our balance sheet was marked at $2 trillion.\nThere are some details that impacted our balance sheet, which I have omitted so as not to\nbore you or entangle you in the entrails of central bank operations: For example, liquidity\nswaps with other central banks declined from a peak occasioned by the financial crisis of\n$583 billion the week ended Dec. 10, 2008, to $330 billion the following March, thus\nsomewhat mitigating the growth of our balance sheet over that period.3\n\n\fFrom my perch, I considered a balance sheet of $2-plus trillion and a base lending rate of\n0-to-1/4 of 1 percent more than sufficient to stimulate not just the housing market but the\nstock market, too, thus placing us on the path of what economists refer to as “the wealth\neffect”—the working assumption that rising prices for homes, stocks and bonds floats the\nincome boat of all Americans.\nI basically said so publicly on March 26, 2009, in a speech to the RISE Forum, an annual\nstudent investment conference. At the time, the S&P 500 was priced at 814, the Nasdaq at\n1,529 and the Dow at 7,750. The mindset of investors at that moment was summarized at\nan earlier FOMC meeting by one of my most esteemed colleagues at the Fed, who\nquipped that in looking at the balance sheets of most financial institutions, “nothing on\nthe right is right and nothing on the left is left.” As I looked at the faces of the students\ngathered in that vast auditorium, I could see in their eyes a reflection of the gloom and\ndoom of the time.\nHere is what I told these young investors that dark morning: “… the current economic\nand financial predicament represents a potential gold mine rather than a minefield.\nHistorically, great investors have made their money by climbing a wall of worry rather\nthan letting a woeful consensus cow them. … Your job as investors is … to ferret out\nfrom the general-market malaise good financial and business operators whose franchises\nand prospects are overdiscounted at current prices. Were I you … I would be licking my\nchops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity. … There are a lot of\ndollar bills that can be found in the debris of the current markets that can be picked up for\nnickels and dimes.”\nOf course, I would not mention this today had I been wrong! Currently, the right hand\nside of the balance sheet of most any well-managed market-traded business is chock-full\nof restructured, cheap debt and leaner common stock, while the left side is bulging with\nsurplus cash. The S&P closed yesterday at 1,819, the Nasdaq at 4,113 and the Dow at\n16,258—a plateau over two times above the valley into which they had descended in\n2009.\nAnd, again, there are the signs of conspicuous consumption I mentioned earlier that\nreflect a fully robust stock market. If there is indeed a wealth effect that spreads from\nclever market operators to the working people of America, a $2 trillion balance sheet\nmight well have been sufficient to have performed the trick.\nThe FOMC is a committee, however, and the majority of my colleagues have disagreed\nwith me on this point. We have since doubled our balance sheet to $4 trillion. This has\nresulted not only in saltatory4 housing, bond and stock markets, but a real economy that is\non the mend, with cyclical unemployment declining and inflation thus far held at bay.\nHere is the rub. We have accomplished the last $2 trillion of balance-sheet expansion by\npurchasing unprecedented amounts of longer-maturity assets: As of Jan. 8, 2014, 75\npercent of Federal Reserve-held loans and securities had remaining maturities in excess\nof five years.\n\n\fA Narrow Needle Eye\nThe brow begins to furrow. To be sure, Treasury and MBS markets are liquid markets.\nBut the old market operator in me is conscious that we hold nearly 40 percent of\noutstanding eligible MBS and of Treasuries with more than five years to maturity. Selling\nthat concentrated an amount of even the most presumably liquid assets would be a heck\nof lot more complicated than accumulating it.\nCurrently, this is not an issue. But as the economy grows, the massive amount of money\nsitting on the sidelines will be activated; the “velocity” of money will accelerate. If it\ndoes so too quickly, we might create inflation or financial market instability or both.\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks house the excess reserves of the depository institutions of\nAmerica: If loan demand fails to grow at the same rate as banks accumulate reserves due\nto our hyperaccommodative monetary policy, the resultant excess reserves are deposited\nwith us at a rate of return of 25 basis points (1/4 of 1 percent per annum).\nHere is some math confronting policymakers: Excess reserves are currently 65 percent of\nthe monetary base and rising. The only other time excess reserves as a percentage of the\nbase have come anywhere close to this level was at the close of the 1930s, when the ratio\nhit 41 percent. We are in uncharted territory.\nTo prevent excess reserves from fueling a too-rapid expansion of bank lending in an\nexpanding economy, the Fed will need to either drain reserves on a large scale by selling\nlonger-term assets at a loss or provide inducements to banks to keep reserves idle, by\noffering interest on excess reserves at a rate competitive with what banks might earn on\nloans to businesses and consumers. Or we might employ more widely new techniques we\nare currently testing, such as “reverse repos,” complex transactions in which we, in\neffect, borrow cash overnight from market operators while posting securities as collateral.\nSuch inducements to control the velocity of the monetary base might expose the Fed to\nintense scrutiny and criticism. The big banks that park the lion’s share of excess reserves\nwith us are hardly the darlings of public sentiment. Raising interest payments to them\nwhile scaling back our remittances to the Treasury might raise a few congressional\neyebrows. And as to our repo operations, we have never implemented them on anywhere\nnear the scale envisioned.\nOf greatest concern to me is that the risk of scrutiny and criticism might hinder\npolicymakers from acting quickly enough to remove or dampen the dry inflationary\ntinder that is inherent in the massive, but currently fallow, monetary base.\nIn the parlance of central banking, the “exit” challenge we now face is somewhat\ndaunting: How do we pass a camel fattened by trillions of dollars of longer-term, lessliquid purchases through the eye of the needle of getting back to a “normalized” balance\nsheet so as to keep inflation under wraps and yet provide the right amount of monetary\nimpetus for the economy to keep growing and expanding?\n\n\fThe First Law of Holes\nI have great faith in the integrity and brainpower of my fellow policymakers. I am\nconfident that the 19 earnest women and men that make up the FOMC will do their level\nbest under Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s leadership to accomplish a smooth exit that keeps\nprices stable and the economy in a job-creating mode. But my confidence will be\nbolstered if my colleagues adopt the First Law of Holes espoused in the late ’70s by thenBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey: “If you find yourself in a hole, stop\ndigging.”\nThe housing market is well along in repair;5 the economy is expanding; cyclical\nunemployment is declining. To be sure, there will be individual data points that appear to\nchallenge confidence, like the just-released employment report for December. But I\nbelieve the odds favor continued economic progress. And I believe that continuing largescale asset purchases risks placing us in an untenable position, both from the standpoint\nof unreasonably inflating the stock, bond and other tradable asset markets and from the\nperspective of complicating the future conduct of monetary policy.\nThe eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat. As\nsoon as feasible, we should change tack. We should stop digging. I plan to cast my votes\nat FOMC meetings accordingly.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\n“It’s Alright,” words and music by Waylon Jennings, copyright Waylon Jennings Music, 1980.\nSee “Address of William McChesney Martin, Jr., Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, before the New York Group of the Investment Bankers Association of\nAmerica,” Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City, Oct. 19, 1955.\n3\nLiquidity swaps continued to fall after March, hitting zero in February 2010.\n4\nMerriam–Webster’s dictionary defines saltatory as “of or relating to dancing; proceeding by\nleaps.”\n5\nSee “The Long-Awaited Housing Recovery,” by John Duca, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nSpecial Report, January 2014, www.dallasfed.org (note: the report will be available online on Jan.\n15).\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 19, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fState of the Texas Economy: An Annual Update\n(With Reference to Gen. Sheridan and John Steinbeck)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Margaret [Keliher].\nToday I am going to talk about one subject only: the Texas economy. As you know, just\nyesterday I was in Washington for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAt the end of the meeting, a statement was issued as to what that committee consisting of the 12\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents and six members of the Fed’s Board of Governors decided\nregarding the course of monetary policy; Chairman Bernanke followed with a press conference.\nIn keeping with our tradition, this morning I will refrain from commenting on the decisions\nmade. We are under a self-imposed “communication blackout” regarding our views about\nmacroeconomic developments or monetary policy issues until after midnight tonight. So if you\nwish, call me at home at 12:01 tomorrow morning and ... incur the eternal wrath of my wife,\nNancy!\nSome of you have undoubtedly heard Gen. Philip Sheridan’s notable expression, “If I owned\nTexas and hell, I would rent out Texas and live in hell.” Although he reportedly recanted his\nstatement, even a man as renowned for his cruelty as Gen. Sheridan would certainly have\nchanged his opinion if he were around today. It wouldn’t have taken him long after crossing the\nriver Styx to realize that rather than renting out Texas he would have been better off purchasing\nevery bit of it. His return on investment would have been astronomical. My hunch is that\nSheridan would want to live in Texas with you and me and would seek to rent out hell—perhaps\nto the U.S. Congress, though it would have to be free of charge given their fiscal predicament!\n\nThe Success of the Lone Star State\nHere’s why I believe Texas is attractive to even the Gen. Sheridans of the world. The state’s total\noutput—the equivalent of gross domestic product—is approximately $1.4 trillion, in the\nneighborhood of countries like Australia and Spain. We produce more oil than Venezuela or\nNorway and more natural gas than Canada or all 28 countries of the European Union combined.\nAnd we produce jobs like gee-whiz. A job is the source of income and the root of security and\nwealth for a productive people. Without income a person cannot consume and invest, engaging\nthe engines of economic growth. Most importantly, a job is the route to dignity as we have\nhistorically defined it in America.\n\n1\n\n\fJobs, Jobs, Jobs\nFor the past 23 years, Texas has outpaced the country in job creation by a factor of more than 2to-1. Here is a slide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and\nfor the U.S. as a whole since 1990:\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment Since 1990\nin Selected States\nIndex, January 1990 = 100\n170\nTexas\n\n160\n150\n\nFlorida\n140\n130\n\nU.S.\n\n120\n\nCalifornia\nIllinois\n\n110\n100\n\nNew York\n\nMichigan\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nNote the dotted black line drawn from the base of 100 in 1990. For the residents of the home of\nMotown or the Empire State or the Land of Lincoln, this graph does not present a happy picture.\nSince 1990, total employment growth in Michigan has been 5 percent, a compound annual\ngrowth rate of 0.17 percent, a pace that is one-twelfth that of Texas over the same period. New\nYork and Illinois have not fared much better.\nIf you zoom in on the period since the onset of the financial crisis, you can see an even greater\ndisparity in employment growth trends for Texas vis-à-vis the other large U.S. states:\n\n2\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment in Selected\nStates Since the Recession Began\nIndex, December 2007 = 100\n108\n\nTexas\n\n106\n104\nNew York\n\n102\n100\n\nU.S.\n98\n96\nIllinois\nCalifornia\nMichigan\nFlorida\n\n94\n92\n90\n88\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIn terms of jobs, Texas was one of the last states to lose ground during the recession and then led\nthe pack in punching through employment levels that prevailed at the end of 2007. Fortunately,\nall of the selected states shown in the chart appear to be recovering, albeit rather slowly, from\nlicks taken during the crisis. However, even the Empire State can’t compare, despite its devotees\nof the perspective captured by Saul Steinberg’s iconic 1976 cover of New Yorker, “View of the\nWorld from Ninth Avenue,” depicting everything west of the Hudson River as a vast wasteland.\nCompared to the view in 1976, Texas stands tall above all the rest. Why is that?\n\nWhy Are Things Bigger (or Better) in Texas?\nMy friends in New York and other foreign places often criticize the relative success of the Lone\nStar State. They like to argue that Texas may well be creating more employment, but it is just\nlow-wage jobs—the kind nobody wants. Well, truth be told, while low-wage jobs grow faster in\nTexas than elsewhere, so do all other jobs. As this next slide makes very clear, Texas also leads\nthe rest of the nation in creating middle-income and high-wage jobs:\n\n3\n\n\fJob Growth by Wage Quartile,\n2001-12\nPercent change\n30\n26.1\n\n25.6\n25\nTexas\n\n20\n15\n\nU.S. minus Texas\n14.1\n\n12.6\n\n10\n\n7.3\n\n5.6\n5\n1.2\n0\n-5\n\n-4.1\n\n-10\nLowest wage quartile\n\nLower-middle wage\nquartile\n\nUpper-middle wage\nquartile\n\nHighest wage quartile\n\nNOTES: Calculations include all workers over age 15 with positive wages. Wage quartiles constructed based on\n2012 Current Population Survey (CPS), which refers to 2011 wages.\nSOURCE: March CPS, 2001, 2012.\n\nThe U.S. ex-Texas has seen net job destruction for middle wage earners over the past decade.\nMeanwhile, Texas has experienced robust job creation for these important middle-income\nworkers. Texas has not been immune to growing income inequality or the larger issue of labor\nmarket polarization, but the notion that Texas only creates minimum wage jobs is a myth.\n\nDiversification Helps\nAnother Texas-growth-miracle fable I enjoy debunking goes like this: All of our state’s job and\nwealth creation comes from the booming energy industry. At the Dallas Fed, we account for the\ninfluence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas extraction and mining directly employ\n2.5 percent of our workforce—two-point-five percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution\nto our state’s total output is roughly 11 percent. So, yes, it is true: We have a strong energy sector\nin Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. I already mentioned that we\nproduce more oil than Venezuela and more natural gas than Canada.\nOn net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit Texans. But look at this slide of the number and\ndiversity of jobs created by sector thus far in 2013. The vertical axis is the number of jobs\ncreated in thousands; the horizontal axis denotes the various job categories and, in parentheses,\nthe share of total jobs represented by each category:\n\n4\n\n\f2013 Employment Growth in Texas\nThousands of jobs\n50\n45.3\n43.3\n45\n\nYear-to-date (Oct. 2013) total jobs gained in Texas = 221,300\n\n38.2\n\n40\n35\n\n29.7\n\n30\n25\n\n19.1\n\n20\n\n17.6\n13.7\n\n15\n\n8.4\n\n10\n\n4.2\n\n5\n0\n\nTrade,\nTransp &\nUtilities\n(20.0%)\n\nLeisure &\nHospitality\n(10.2%)\n\nProf. &\nBusiness\nServices\n(13.1%)\n\nEducational\nOil & Gas\n& Health Construction Extraction\nServices\nand Mining\n(5.5%)\n(13.4%)\nSupport\n(2.5%)\n\nFinancial\nActivities\n(6.1%)\n\nInformation\n(1.8%)\n\n3.3\n\nGov’t Manufacturing\n(7.8%)\n(16.0%)\n\nNOTES: Categories are North American Industry Classification System supersectors. Data seasonally adjusted.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 17,600 jobs, or 8 percent, of the\n221,300 positions created in Texas in January through October of this year. Of course, the oil\nand gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic impact is greater than just these\n17,600 jobs. For example, a University of Texas at San Antonio study estimates that the Eagle\nFord Shale generated over $61 billion in economic impact and supported 116,000 jobs in 2012.\nAnd this is just one of four important oil and natural gas producing regions in the Eleventh\nFederal Reserve District that the shale boom has significantly affected. In 2012, the Permian\nBasin, Barnett, Haynesville and Eagle Ford accounted for 25 percent of U.S. oil supply and 28\npercent of U.S. natural gas supply. 1\nObviously, the oil patch has been a boon to Texas growth. But in 2013, trade, transportation and\nutilities accounted for 45,300 jobs; leisure and hospitality, 43,300; professional and business\nservices, 38,200; educational and health services, 29,700; and construction, 19,100. As this chart\nshows, oil and gas is but the sixth strongest source of job creation. Ours is a diversified economy,\ncreating jobs across the spectrum and in all income categories.\n\nBlessed to Be in Texas\nHere are some other facts and figures that help round out the economic picture of our state.\nIn the housing sector, Texas largely avoided the housing boom and bust that struck most of the\nnation. We did not experience a housing bubble:\n\n5\n\n\fU.S. and Texas Housing Prices\nHouse Price Index, Q1 1991=100*\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\nTX\nU.S.\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n* FHFA Purchase-Only House Price Index, which relies on actual home purchase prices, not appraised values.\nSOURCE: Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).\n\nNor did we suffer a housing bust:\n\nTexas Did Not Have a Housing Bust:\nAnnualized Change in FHFA House Price Index 2006-2011\n\nIt helped that a 1997 amendment to the Texas Constitution allowed home equity loans and cashout refinancing for the first time in the state’s history, but limited the amount of total debt (new\nloan plus the first mortgage) to no more than 80 percent of a home’s value. Combined with other\n6\n\n\ffactors such as ample land availability and fewer development and zoning restrictions, Texas\nhousing stock increased during the last decade’s national boom without the rapidly rising home\nprices experienced elsewhere. With borrowing under control and house prices relatively stable,\nthe state escaped the brunt of the housing sector fallout and experienced relatively few\nunderwater mortgages:\n\nTexas’ Lower Share of Underwater Mortgages\nPercent of mortgages with balance > home value*\n40\n\n36\n\n35\n\n32\n\n30\n25\n\n25\n\n23\n\n20\n15\n\n15\n\n15\n10\n4\n\n5\n0\nNevada\n\nFlorida\n\nArizona\n\nMichigan\n\nCalifornia\n\nTexas\n\nU.S.\n\n* As of second quarter 2013.\nSOURCE: CoreLogic.\n\nAs to the sector we at the Dallas Fed supervise directly, fewer Texas banks have suffered net\nlosses than in the rest of the nation:\n\nShare of Banks that Are Unprofitable:\nU.S. and 11th District\nPercent of Banks Reporting a Net Loss\n35\n31\n30\n\nU.S.\n\n11th District\n\n25\n22\n20\n15\n\n14\n\n15\n\n13\n10\n\n10\n7\n6\n5\n0\n\n7\n4\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 *\n* YTD through third quarter 2013.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n7\n\n\f¡Viva Méxicoǃ\nLast, Texas is blessed to have a great neighbor to the immediate south. The Mexican economy\nhas a significant impact on our state; a fortunate development for us, given that its economy is\nbeing transformed to a greater degree than most people here in El Norte realize. Admittedly,\nMexico hit a rough patch in the first half of this year, but the Dallas Fed sees this as largely due\nto transitory factors.\nIt is surprising to many that Mexico recovered more quickly from the Great Recession than the\nUnited States. Inflation in Mexico has reached record lows after trending down for two decades\nfollowing important reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation\ntargeting in 2001. Relatively low inflation, together with a stable peso, has protected the\npurchasing power of the Mexican consumer and allowed income and savings to grow. Further,\nafter its horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending, Mexico’s\nbanking industry is well capitalized and growing again, and financial access, while still limited,\nis expanding quickly.\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up\n62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico\njoined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade\nOrganization) in 1986 and ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, it has\nforged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which\ncompares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers have a commitment\nto fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and have chosen to abide by it\nrather than take the “kick-the-can-down-the-road” approach.\nWith all the progress in the macroeconomy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are\nwhat Mexico now needs to catapult to a leadership role among emerging-market economies.\nPresident Peña Nieto appears to be doing just that, pushing forward with structural\nmodernization. Mexico might best be described, in economic parlance, as an “emerged country.”\n\nExports, Exports, Exports\nTexas benefits from a stronger Mexico in many ways, including on the export front. Here is a\npicture of the export growth from our trade relationships with our increasingly successful\nsouthern neighbor, as well as our other major trading partners:\n\n8\n\n\fTexas Export Growth\nIndex, Jan. 2000=100*\n240\nOther\n\n220\n\n2013:Q3\n\n18%\n\nMexico\nCanada\n\n200\n\n15%\n\n3%\n11%\n\nTexas\n\n8%\n\nEuropean Union\n\n180\n\nAsia, excl.

Since the beginning of 2009, Texas exports have grown more than 70 percent\nwhile the nation’s exports, sans Texas, have increased at half that pace and are only now back to\nprerecession levels.\n\nA Great Place for Immigrants\nOf course, not every facet of the Texas economy is as supportive of the economic narrative\nexpressed by the previous charts. Texas lags most other states in social services. We are the\nantithesis of the welfare state. And yet, if you believe people vote with their feet and put their\nmoney where their mouth is, the balance Texas has struck between job creation and social\nservices seems appropriate enough to attract the diaspora from the other mega-states. We draw\nmassive inflows of business investment, and we attract significant numbers of newcomers. In\nrecent years, Texas has consistently welcomed more migrants—foreign and domestic—than any\nother state. 2\nDomestic migration is a brain and human-resource gain for Texas and corresponding drain from\nsending states. Texas transplants have higher levels of education than native Texans and fill key\nniches in the high-skilled labor force. Since 2004, California has been the largest sending state\nby far—nearly one-quarter of net domestic migration to Texas between 2006 and 2012 came\nfrom California. In fact, so many Californians have been moving to Texas in recent years that the\nprice of a one-way, 26-foot U-Haul rental truck from San Francisco to San Antonio is over twice\nthe price for the same truck traveling in the opposite direction.\n\n9\n\n\fTop Sending States for Migration to Texas\nCalifornia\n23%\nOther\n33%\n\nFlorida\n9%\n\nTennessee\n3%\nNorth Carolina\n3%\nNew Jersey\n4%\nArizona\n4%\n\nNew York\n7%\n\nAlaska\n4%\n\nMichigan\n4%\n\nIllinois\n6%\n\nSOURCE: 2006-12 American Community Survey.\n\nMany of the high-skilled migrants coming to our state are drawn to the high-tech, health care,\nprofessional and business services, and energy sectors in the fast-growing “Texas Triangle”\ncities—Austin, Houston and Dallas–Fort Worth. Internal Revenue Service tax records suggest\nthat over 80 percent of taxpayers who moved into Texas during 2000–10 flowed into these three\nmetropolitan areas, which also experienced significant inflows from other parts of Texas.\nThus, it comes as no surprise that these major metros have been huge contributors to the state’s\nstrong overall employment growth. Year-to-date through October, Dallas–Fort Worth has added\n87,400 jobs. The DFW metro area has maintained a year-over-year annual growth rate greater\nthan 2 percent since January 2011 (34 months and counting). Due south, down Interstate 45,\nthere’s a new Houstonian every four minutes, given current in-migration and net population\ngrowth trends. Houstonians are also on a homebuying tear; this year the pace has averaged one\nhome sale every six minutes. In summary, Texas is attracting bright minds and eager workers\nfrom across the nation, and we are all better off for it.\n\nAnd You Can’t Fault the Fed\nThere are many reasons that Texas is outpacing the nation in terms of economic growth. But one\nthing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that the underperformance of other large states, like\nCalifornia, relative to Texas has nothing to do with Federal Reserve policy. After all, Texas is\nsubject to the same monetary policy as California and the other states of the union. Texans pay\nsimilar interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We\noperate under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and\ncompete in the same financial markets as the rest of the nation.\n10\n\n\fSo what gives? If my charts did not impress you, then perhaps the economic miracle of Texas\ncan be best explained by John Steinbeck’s account of his travels across America with his poodle,\nCharley, in 1960:\nI have said that Texas is a state of mind, but I think it is more than that. It is a\nmystique closely approximating a religion. And this is true to the extent that\npeople either passionately love Texas or passionately hate it and, as in other\nreligions, few people dare to inspect it for fear of losing their bearings in mystery\nor paradox. But I think there will be little quarrel with my feeling that Texas is\none thing. For all its enormous range of space, climate, and physical appearance,\nand for all the internal squabbles, contentions, and strivings, Texas has a tight\ncohesiveness perhaps stronger than any other section of America. Rich, poor,\nPanhandle, Gulf, city, country, Texas is the obsession, the proper study, and the\npassionate possession of all Texans. 3\nSteinbeck nailed it. Above all, Texas is a state of mind where people are ready to work and get\nthings done for the betterment of their families, communities, cities and beyond. We should be\nproud, indeed, to call the Lone Star State our home. 4\nI usually end my speeches by saying “In the great tradition of central bankers, I would now be\nhappy to avoid answering your questions.” But given that monetary policy is off limits this\nmorning, and I am never shy on Texas brag, I’d be glad to answer any and all of the questions\nyou might have.\n\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\fNOTES\n1\n\nFor more information on the shale boom in the Eleventh District, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/econdata/energy.cfm.\n2\nFor an excellent report on how immigration affects the Texas economy, see “Gone to Texas:\nImmigration and the Transformation of the Texas Economy,” by Pia M.

            "content": "Comments on Monetary Policy\n(With Praise for Urban Lehner, Norman Borlaug and Dentists)\n\nRemarks before the DTN/The Progressive Farmer Ag Summit 2013\n\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nChicago\nDecember 9, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Monetary Policy\n(With Praise for Urban Lehner, Norman Borlaug and Dentists)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Urban (Lehner).\nI lived in Tokyo for much of 1990, when Urban was bureau chief of the Wall Street\nJournal there. He taught me Japan, steering me away from then-stereotypical views\nharbored by American analysts and guiding me through a deep dive into Japanese\nliterature and history that later served me well when I was deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative and negotiated with the Japanese. Only Urban Lehner could have authored\na masterpiece like “Let’s Talk Turkey About Japanese Turkeys and Other Tales….”1 His\ndeep understanding of the uniqueness of Japan is impressive, as is his work the past\ndecade as a discerning editor of DTN/The Progressive Farmer. Thank you, Urban, for\nyour friendship and insights.\nIn Praise of Norman Borlaug\nYou might wonder why I so readily accepted Urban’s invitation to speak to this great\ngroup of farm and agriculture leaders on a cold December day. Typically, I and my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) defer to my respected\ncolleague, Esther George, the president of the Kansas City Fed, and her able staff for\ncommentary on developments in agriculture. I promise the rapidity of my acceptance of\nUrban’s invitation to speak to you has little to do with my eagerness to see the Dallas\nCowboys manhandle the Bears tonight at Soldier Field. But my link to you and to\nagriculture actually does come from sports: from Little League baseball rather than NFL\nfootball.\nAs Urban mentioned, I grew up in Mexico City. I played Little League there for the\nLeones (the Lions). My coach was Norman Borlaug. I doubt there is a person in this\nroom who doesn’t know and revere that name. Back in 1970, when the Nobel committee\nawarded the Peace Prize based on proven success and true merit, I believe their citation\nprovided the best summary of Norman Borlaug’s contribution to mankind: “More than\nany other single person of this age,” the Nobel committee declared, “he has helped\nprovide bread for a hungry world” with his development of genetically unique strains of\n“semi-dwarf” wheat.2 I don’t think one can overstate what Norman Borlaug’s “green\nrevolution” accomplished: He saved billions of people from starvation by applying\nscience to agriculture.\n\n\fBorlaug developed those wheat strains working in Mexico with a grant from the\nRockefeller Foundation. When he wasn’t in the lab or out in the field, or letting his son\nBilly and me ride with him on his tractor, he coached me in Mexico City’s Little League.\nI stayed in close touch over the years with the Borlaugs and often spoke of my coach at\nour family dinner table. One year, he came to my daughter Alison’s school, Hockaday in\nDallas, to speak at a lower-school assembly. The headmistress began by asking if any of\nthe girls knew why Mr. Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize. Alison’s hand shot up.\nShe thought it was “for coaching Little League baseball.”\nNorman Borlaug died on Sept. 12, 2009. That very day, another of our little cadre of\ngringos who grew up in Mexico City, Professor Bill Raun of Oklahoma State University,\nwas visiting his idol and showing him the latest version of a handheld device he had\ndeveloped called the GreenSeeker. The sensor could be used by any farmer in the field to\neasily determine how much fertilizer and nitrogen to properly apply.3 Borlaug approved.\nIn fact, the very last words he uttered before passing away were “Take it to the farmer.”\nI am honored that you have given me the chance to “take it to the farmer” by speaking\nhere today.\nIn Ag, the Cure for High Prices Is … High Prices\nBefore joining the Fed, as mentioned by Urban, I spent four years as deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative and countless hours trying to settle vexing ag trade disputes not only with\nthe Japanese but with many other countries. So if you permit me to nostalgically stray\nfrom my current role as a central banker, I am going to take the liberty of speaking briefly\nto recent developments in agriculture before providing my personal perspective on the\noutlook for the economy and monetary policy.\nWe are seeing a significant and sustained correction in the price of wheat and corn. I\nexpect soybeans to follow, as well as the sources of animal protein created from these\nbasic plant-food stocks. We have had bumper crops of wheat and corn and huge plantings\nof soy. When I say “we,” I am referring not just to the United States but to what I call the\nglobalized breadbasket, which consists of the United States, the Black Sea area, Canada,\nAustralia, Latin America and other growing areas that have responded with prodigious\noutput to high prices that prevailed for a sustained period. These are elevated prices that\nhave popularly been attributed to surging demand from China and others that have moved\nup the protein ladder as they have achieved greater prosperity in the post-Cold War, postMao Zedong world.\n\n\fFrom an economic standpoint, there are lessons to be learned here. First, the farmer’s rule\nof thumb on price movements still obtains: The cure for high prices is high prices. As\nnight follows day, farmers, aided today by successive iterations of Norman Borlaug’s\ninnovations and new, easy-to-use technological achievements like Bill Raun’s, will\nrespond to demand-pull inflation in crop prices with greater plantings and harvests, often\nto the point of overshooting. This is no doubt a phenomenon you will be pursuing at this\nsummit on “Tactics to Tame Volatility.”\nAs you consider potential tactics, I hope you will keep the following in mind:\na) Free trade is essential for farmers everywhere. Protectionism is the surest path to\neconomic hell. We want a global breadbasket, and we want U.S. farmers and all\nthose interests in the U.S. who make it possible to till fields everywhere—from\nour great machinery makers to our fertilizer and agribusiness firms—to be able to\ncompete in every market worldwide as well as with foreign companies in our own\nmarket. Competition sharpens wits and strengthens muscles. In an openly\ncompetitive world, I have no doubt our producers and companies will continually\noutperform others.\nb) It is important that Borlaug’s revolution of genetic modification be responsibly\ncarried forward. Otherwise, the freer-trade regime that has been achieved can be\nthreatened. Or be exploited so as to instill protectionism. I am thinking\nparticularly of the current situation of the millions of tons of corn currently sitting\noff China’s shores, held out of the Chinese market ostensibly because of its GMO\n(genetically modified organism) characteristics, despite its acceptance in other\nmajor markets, including our own. I have no desire to enter into any argument\nwith greens and environmentalists; I simply wish to suggest that you might\nconsider ways to reach internationally agreed-upon standards for GMO\nenhancement.\nI would add a “c,” a third point for you to bear in mind: You had all better use to the good\nthis unusual period in economic history of proactively accommodative monetary policy\nby the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. The FOMC has made money the\ncheapest and most widely available of any time in American history. Interest rates dipped\nto their lowest level in 237 years; bond and stock markets rallied to historic highs in both\nnominal and real terms; bankers and investors are flush with liquidity; for anybody who\nis creditworthy, money is über-abundant. This will not last forever. One would be foolish\nnot to exploit it now.\n\n\fThe Course of Monetary Policy\nIn discussing the course of monetary policy, I can only speak to my own views.\nAs Urban mentioned, I will be a voter on the FOMC next year. I am happy to lay out for\nyou my perspective. It is this: In my view, the Federal Reserve has supplied more than\nsufficient liquidity to fuel economic recovery above and beyond a reduction of\nunemployment from its current level of 7 percent. As I just said, money is cheap and\nliquidity is abundant. Indeed, it is coursing over the gunwales of the ship of our economy,\nplacing us at risk of becoming submerged in financial shenanigans rather than in\nconducting business based on fundamentals.\nMonetary Policy Rendered Flaccid\nTo be sure, the job creators in our economy—private companies—have used this period\nof accommodative monetary policy to clean up the liability side of their balance sheets\nand fine-tune their bottom lines by buying shares and increasing dividends. They have\nalso continued achieving productivity enhancement and relentless reduction in SG&A\n(selling, general and administrative expenses). Running tight ships, they are now poised\nto hire as they become more confident about nonmonetary matters that remain\nunresolved.\nI used to say that the United States was the best-looking horse in the global glue factory.\nNow, I firmly believe we are the most fit stallion or filly on the global racetrack: Our\ncompanies are the most financially prepared and most productively operated they have\nbeen at any time during the nearly four decades since I graduated from business school.\nWhat is holding them back is not the cost or the availability of credit and finance. What is\nholding them back is fiscal and regulatory policy that is, at best, uncertain, and at worst,\ncounterproductive.\nAgainst that background, I believe that the current program of purchasing $85 billion per\nmonth in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities comes at a cost that far exceeds\nits purported benefits. Presently, there is no private or public company that I know of,\nincluding many CCC-rated credits, that does not now have access to sufficient, cheap\ncapital. There is no private or public company I know of that considers monetary policy\nto be deficient. Instead, to a company, every CEO I talk to feels that uncertainty derived\nfrom fiscal policy and regulatory interference is the key government-induced deterrent to\nmore robust economic growth and profitability.\nThe FOMC has helped enable a sharp turn in the housing market and roaring stock and\nbond markets. I would argue that the former benefited the middle-income quartiles, while\n\n\fthe latter has primarily benefited the rich and the quick. Though the recent numbers are\nencouraging, easy money has failed to encourage the robust payroll expansion that is the\nbasis for the sustained consumer demand on which our economy depends. It cannot do so\nin and of itself. Without fiscal policy that incentivizes rather than discourages U.S. capex\n(capital expenditure), this accommodative monetary policy aimed at reducing\nunemployment (especially structural unemployment) or improving the quality of jobs is\nrendered flaccid and less than optimally effective. And as to the housing markets, prices\nare now appreciating to levels that may be hampering affordability in many markets.\nWhat About Inflation?\nAs to the issue of inflation, the run rate for personal consumption expenditure (PCE)\nprices in the third quarter was 2 percent, according to recently revised data. The Dallas\nFed computes a Trimmed Mean analysis of the PCE, which we feel provides a more\naccurate view of inflationary developments. The 12-month run rate for the Trimmed\nMean PCE has been steady at 1.3 percent for the past seven months.\nAs measured by surveys and financial market indicators, expected inflation five or more\nyears out is anchored firmly at levels consistent with the 2 percent rate that modern\ncentral bankers now cotton to as appropriate. These surveys and indicators also show\nexpected price increases over 2014 only modestly below 2 percent.\nAgainst this background, I am not of the school of thought that monetary policy need\ncontinue to be hyperaccommodative or be made even more so in order to bring mediumterm inflation expectations closer to target. I certainly don’t see any justification for\nseeking to raise medium-term expectations above 2 percent as an inducement for\nbusinesses to pour on capex and expand payrolls or for policy to act as an incentive for\nconsumers to go out and spend more money now rather than later. To me, this would just\nundermine the slowly improving confidence we have begun to see.\nEspecially given that we have a surfeit of excess liquidity sloshing about in the system,\nthe idea of ramping up inflation expectations from their current tame levels strikes me as\nshort-sighted and even reckless. We already have enough kindling for potential long-term\ninflation, which will sorely test our capacity to manage policy going forward. I do not\nwish to add further wood to that pile.\n\n\fIt Is Time to Taper\nIn my view, we at the Fed should begin tapering back our bond purchases at the earliest\nopportunity. To enable the markets to digest this change of course with minimal\ndisruption, we should do so within the context of a clearly articulated, well-defined\ncalendar for reducing purchases on a steady path to zero. We should make clear that,\nbarring some serious economic crisis, we will stay the course of reduction rather than\ngive an imprecise nod as we did after the May and June meetings that led markets to\nbelieve the program might end as unemployment reached 7 percent.\nOnly then can we at the Fed return to focusing on management of the overnight rate that\nanchors the yield curve. To be sure, we may wish to keep overnight rates low for a\nprolonged period, depending on economic developments. But we need to return to\nconducting monetary policy that is more in keeping with the normal role of a central\nbank. We need to break away from trying to manipulate term premia and stop prolonging\nthe distortions that accrue from our massive long-term bond purchases and the risks we\nincur in building an ever-expanding balance sheet that is now approaching $4 trillion.\nBecoming Dentists Once Again\nI consider this strategy desirable on its own merit: I would feel more comfortable were\nwe to remove ourselves as soon as possible from interfering with the normal price-setting\nfunctioning of financial markets. And I consider it desirable from the standpoint of\nprotecting our limited franchise. As Chairman (Ben) Bernanke has pointed out politely,\nand I have argued less diplomatically, good monetary policy is necessary—but certainly\nnot sufficient—to return the nation to full employment. Acting as though we can go it\nalone only builds expectations that far exceed our capacity. And it could lead us to\nbelieve that we have a greater capacity to control economic outcomes than we actually\nhave.\nIf I may paraphrase a sainted figure for many of my colleagues, John Maynard Keynes: If\nthe members of the FOMC could manage to get themselves to once again be thought of\nas humble, competent people on the level of dentists, that would be splendid.4 I would\nargue that the time to reassume a more humble central banker persona is upon us.\nThat, Urban, is my take on monetary policy in a nutshell. Now, in the best tradition of\ncentral banking—and dentistry! —I would be happy to avoid answering any questions\nyou or your colleagues might have.\nThank you.\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nSee Let’s Talk Turkey (About Japanese Turkeys): And Other Tales from the Asian Wall Street Journal,\nUrban C.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSydney, Australia\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA U.S. Economic Update and Perspective on Monetary Policy\n(With Reference to Leslie W. Fisher)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Stephen [Halmarick].\nI am thrilled to be back in Sydney. Earlier this morning, I visited Reserve Bank Governor\nStevens and his staff and provided a read on the U.S. economy and monetary policy as of last\nweek’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nI thought I would do the same for you this afternoon. I would then be happy, in the best tradition\nof central banking, to avoid answering any questions you have.\nTo Begin, a Biographical Note\nAs was mentioned by Stephen, I am indeed half Aussie. My father, Leslie Fisher, was a\nQueenslander. In 1910, at the age of five years and two months, he was arrested for begging on\nthe streets in Maryborough and sentenced in the court there to seven years in the Westbrook\nReformatory. 1\nAccording to an article earlier this year in Toowoomba’s daily, The Chronicle, Westbrook was\n“the most feared reformatory in Australia.” The guards there meted out “vicious beatings.” 2\nThankfully, my father’s sentence was commuted after one month; “the little boy … is of tender\nyears and not a fit subject,” wrote the Police Magistrate. My father was released to an orphanage,\nthen shuttled among a series of harsh foster homes before making his way back to the streets and\na remarkable career that took him from Toowoomba to Brisbane to South Africa, Mexico, China,\nand the United States and, ultimately, to … the great republic of Texas!\nMy dad lived to the ripe old age of 90. He was a tough old bird. And Aussie to the bone. For\nmost of his life, he smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and drank a great deal of Scotch. He\nadmitted to this one evening and a friend said, “Hold on. My father was a smoker and also drank\na lot of Scotch. But he died at 60. What gives?” To which my father replied, “Well, he just didn’t\ndo it long enough.” 3\nThe Westbrook prison is no more; indeed, the property on which it stood was sold in May of this\nyear. But the courthouse in Maryborough where my father was sentenced still stands. On\nWednesday, I will visit it to remind myself of where I come from. And to thank my lucky stars\nthat I am the son of a gutsy Australian who managed in one generation to secure his family’s rise\nfrom homeless to Harvard, from begging for food to riches, from being a ward of the state to\nbecoming a principal in the policymaking of the most important central bank in the world.\n\n1\n\n\fSo Stephen, when I say “I am thrilled” to be here, I mean it. I thank you for having me, the son\nof the humblest of Queenslanders, address such a distinguished audience here in Sydney.\nThe Fed in Context\nAustralia was in the grips of a great economic contraction when my father roamed the streets of\nMaryborough. The economic depression here reverberated from a lengthy economic downturn in\nthe United States that crystalized in the Panic of 1907—the so-called “Rich Man’s Panic”\nbeginning in May of that year. It saw the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., the third-largest\nbank in New York, and many other banks of deposit in the U.S. as well as then notable financial\ninstitutions in places as far away as Egypt, Japan, Hamburg, Chile and here, Down Under. 4\nEarly in 1907, Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb & Co. gave a speech to the New York Chamber of\nCommerce. He warned that “unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit\nresources, [the United States] will undergo the most severe and far-reaching money panic in\nhistory.” 5 His words were prescient.\nAt the time, we did not have a central bank in the United States; we had not had one for over\nseven decades. The United States had two central banks before 1907: the First Bank of the\nUnited States lasted 20 years before its charter expired in 1811 and was not renewed by\nCongress; the Second Bank of the United States also lasted 20 years before being closed by\nPresident Andrew Jackson in 1836.\nIn 1907, the American financial system was, for all practical purposes, under the control of a\nhandful of financiers. Foremost among them was J.P. Morgan. Mr. Morgan was capable of\nmaneuvering through the ups and downs of an economy and financial system without a central\nbank and become ever richer. The majority of American businesses and bankers could not and\nwere waylaid by recession and financial panic. For all practical purposes, J.P. Morgan was the\nclosest thing to a lender of last resort but was a profiteer, and thus a very poor substitute for a\ncentral bank that Jacob Schiff so rightly said we needed.\nThe Panic of 1907 led to the creation by Congress of the National Monetary Commission and, to\nmake a long story short, that commission, led by Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, laid the\ngroundwork for President Woodrow Wilson and the Congress to create the Federal Reserve\nSystem in 1913 and establish the system’s 12 Federal Reserve Banks in 1914.\nThe Fed is uniquely American in structure. It is disaggregated, with the working business of the\ncentral bank distributed across the land through 12 Federal Reserve districts. For example, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, conduct\nthe Fed’s business and represent the perspectives of 27 million people and almost $1.5 trillion in\nannual output from Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico—roughly the\nequivalent of the population and output of Australia.\n2\n\n\fThe president of the United States appoints and the U.S. Senate confirms the chairman and the\nsix other governors of the Fed who reside in Washington. The presidents who operate the\nbusiness of our central bank through the dozen Federal Reserve Banks spread across the nation\nare not federal employees. They work under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board, but\nserve at the pleasure of and answer to their own boards of directors that consist of nine private\ncitizens from their individual Reserve Bank districts. The 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents\nrepresent the heartland of the country, “Main Street” as we say in the States. Unlike the Federal\nReserve governors, we do not suffer in having to live in the politically charged atmosphere of\nWashington, D.C.; we operate banker’s banks rather than maneuvering around the lobbyists and\nrent seekers that leech off the political center of our nation.\nTo make monetary policy, all 19 of these principals—the seven governors and the 12 Federal\nReserve Bank presidents—convene every six weeks as the FOMC under the leadership of the\nprimus inter pares, the Federal Reserve Chairman.\nThe mandate of the FOMC is to preserve price and financial stability while conducting monetary\npolicy so as to engender full employment. Think of the Federal Reserve this way: President\nWilson and the Congress of the United States formed a central bank to mitigate the risks of\nAmericans suffering through the economically desperate conditions my father experienced as a\nchild. Like my dad, the Fed has made mistakes and has far from a spotless record. Its role in the\nGreat Depression of the 1930s, the Great Inflation of the 1970s and the run-up to the financial\npanic and ensuing deep recession of 2007–09 come to mind. But over the course of its hundredyear lifetime, the Fed has successfully anchored America’s prosperity.\nCurrent Policy\nWhat about now? Are we doing the job we are supposed to do?\nAs you might imagine, given my roots as a half-Aussie and my being a full-blown Texan, and\ngiven that, as mentioned, the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents are not beholden to the\npresident or Senate of the United States and fear no personal political retribution, I pull no\npunches when I discuss the U.S. economy and our monetary policy. The views I express today\nare my own and mine only.\nI say that the economy of the United States is hog-tied by a government that is sadly ineffective\nand, in fact, counterproductive. We have a government that hasn’t been able to agree on a budget\nin five years; that has historically, under both Republican and Democrat presidents and\nCongresses, spent money and committed itself to fund long-term programs without devising\nrevenue streams to cover current costs or fund future liabilities. It is a government that is more\neffective at forming commissions to discuss what they might do—the president and Congress\njust recently have agreed to their ninth such commission in three years—than in getting anything\n3\n\n\fdone to provide businesses, employers, workers and the citizenry the certainty they need to\nconfidently plan their futures.\nUnder these circumstances, it is no small wonder American businesses are not expanding and\ngrowing jobs at the pace we at the Fed would like to see. It is no small wonder that our economy\nis growing at a substandard pace compared to previous recoveries. It is no small wonder that the\nmost expansive monetary policy the FOMC has ever engineered has been hampered from\naccomplishing what it set out to do. In short, while the Fed has been moving at the speed of a\nboomer in full run, the federal government of the United States has at best exhibited the adaptive\nalacrity of a koala (without being anywhere near as cute).6\nI illustrate this point with some simple math from the most elementary formula for calculating\ngross domestic product (GDP). Private expenditures on goods and services increased at a 3.2\npercent rate over the expansion to date, whereas GDP has increased at 2.2 percent. One could say\nthat GDP would have risen at 3.2 percent had government expenditure increased at the same rate\nas private expenditure. Or, more modestly, if government spending had just been held constant,\ninstead of contracting, GDP would have grown at an annual rate of 2.6 percent.\nI am not a proponent of ever-increasing government spending. Indeed, for many years I have\nbeen an outspoken critic of the federal government’s fiscal misfeasance. I mention this simply to\nillustrate a point: Unlike in most recoveries, government has played a countercyclical,\nsuppressive role. The inability of our government to get its act together has countered the\nprocyclical policy of the Federal Reserve.\nLet me expand on this and describe, from my personal perspective, the pros and cons and\ncost/benefit analysis we must now consider as we contemplate future monetary policy.\n(The remaining remarks will be delivered from the podium).\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nThe records of these events are not available on the web and are, in part, handwritten in Queensland’s\nofficial records, which are not available publicly.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew York City\nOctober 17, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAnnus Horribilis or Annus Mirabilis?\n(With Reference to Errol Flynn, Robert Roosa, Queen Elizabeth II, Winston\nChurchill, Felix Rohatyn and Mick Jagger)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you Bill [Dudley]. It is a pleasure to be introduced by my colleague from the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York. Bill is a friend as well as a colleague. Though it is our custom at the\nFederal Reserve to only speak for ourselves and never for any other member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), I think I can safely say that all 11 of Bill’s fellow Federal Reserve\nBank presidents and, indeed, all the governors at the Federal Reserve Board, are grateful for\nBill’s skillful leadership and total devotion to our collective mission. He is a hopeless golfer but\na great human being. I want to take this opportunity to formally thank him for his service to the\nFed and to our country.\nRobert Roosa and Wild Dreams\nIt is a very special honor for me to speak at the Economic Club of New York. My very first job\nafter graduating from Stanford Business School was at Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. as the\npolicy assistant to Robert Roosa. Bob Roosa was the proud chairman of the Economic Club from\n1970 to 1971. He used to regale me with its history, of how anybody who was of consequence\nhad spoken here, from Presidents Wilson and Eisenhower and Kennedy to Winston Churchill\nand Indira Gandhi and Zhu Rongji (and many others since).\nI mentioned this to my wife Nancy before flying up here. Without much humility, I asked her,\n“In your wildest dreams did you ever think that your husband would follow in the footsteps of\nthe world’s great leaders and speak to the Economic Club of New York?” You know what her\nanswer was? “Richard, we have been married for 40 years. You don’t appear in my wildest\ndreams.”\nThe Nightmare of Fiscal Policy\nI came to speak to you this morning not of pleasant dreams but of the nightmare of fiscal\nindecision and political chicanery that emanates from Washington, the risk it poses to the\nreputation of our nation, and the limits it imposes on monetary policy.\nI did not come to speak of whether or not we should or might “taper” our asset purchases at the\nnext meeting of the FOMC. Or of how Janet Yellen will lead the committee when she succeeds\nBen Bernanke. Or how I might vote when I rotate into a voter’s slot on the FOMC next year. I\nwould be happy to avoid answering those and any other questions you might have during the\nQ&A session.\n\n1\n\n\fErrol Flynn and Felix Rohatyn\nThe iconic actor Errol Flynn (who, to the best of my knowledge, was not a member of the\nEconomic Club) is reported to have quipped that his legendary financial problems lay “in\nreconciling my gross habits with my net income.” This is the most concise description I can\nmarshal to explain the problem plaguing our nation’s fiscal authorities. And it has not changed\nwith the 11th-hour temporary agreement reached last night by the leaders of Congress and the\npresident. Kicking the can down the road for a few months will not solve the pathology of fiscal\nmisfeasance that undermines our economy and threatens our future.\nI have no doubt that we will go on indefinitely increasing the debt ceiling, be it in a regular or a\nherky-jerky, just-in-the-nick-of-time pattern. For no president or congressional leader dares risk\nbeing recorded in the history books as having consciously presided over default and the\ndestruction of “the full faith and credit of the United States.” Republican or Democrat, all know\nfull well that your fellow New Yorker, Felix Rohatyn, was spot-on some 37 years ago during\nNew York’s great fiscal crisis when he likened default to “someone stepping into a tepid bath\nand slashing his wrists—you might not feel yourself dying, but that’s what would happen.”1\nBut there is, I believe, a limit of tolerance for our government’s fiscally counterproductive, Errol\nFlynn-like ways. I believe that razor in hand, we are stepping toward Rohatyn’s tepid bath and\nthat the full faith and credit of the United States government is, in fact, at risk.\nHaircuts …\nWe saw an expression of this last Thursday when Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.\nannounced it would apply an increased “haircut” to its valuation of U.S. Treasury securities held\nas collateral against futures trades, with Treasuries maturing in less than one year receiving a risk\ndiscount of 3 percent. This was printed on Friday in a highlighted box above the fold on the front\npage of the Financial Times. Opposite was a picture of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who the\npaper reported had “signaled Beijing’s increasing concern at an Asian summit” and then\nprovided a kindly no-wonder reminder that “China has about 60 percent of its $3.5 trillion\nforeign currency reserves invested in U.S. assets.”2\nThe FT could easily have substituted Premier Li’s picture with one of the German chancellor or\nthe Japanese or British prime minister or the Mexican president, or any other world leader or\nbusiness operator or simple observer of events, and ascribed to any of them a more explicit but\nsurely pervasively held concern: “What the hell is happening to America?” Has the American\nship of state, as Maureen Dowd wrote yesterday, turned into a “ship of fools”?3\n… and Tipping Points\nMy heart bleeds for my country, for no amount of monetary accommodation, no conceivable\namount of “large-scale asset purchases,” no clever new monetary innovation by the Federal\n\n2\n\n\fReserve can offset the rot that is destroying our fiscal house and the blight it spreads over our\neconomy.\nTo be clear, the Federal Reserve will take all appropriate measures to preserve money market\nfunctioning and stability in periods of acute distress. I view this as an integral part of our formal\ndual mandate. Chaotic money markets threaten both price stability and business activity and\nemployment. However, it is not our job to fix the budget impasse. Any initiatives we might have\nto undertake in the course of our duty as a central bank to prevent serious disruptions of U.S.\ndollar funding markets should not be executed in a way that they might be construed to substitute\nfor fiscal redress. Fundamental, structural imbalances in our economy might be temporarily\nobscured but cannot be permanently resolved by monetary sleight of hand.\nIndeed, I argue that the current monetary accommodation policy of purchasing $85 billion a\nmonth in Treasuries and MBS (mortgage-backed securities) risks exacerbating the situation:\nThere is a tipping point where monetary accommodation comes to be viewed not as a pleasant\nstimulus that levitates bond and stock and housing markets leading to a felicitous “wealth\neffect,” but instead as an agent of financial recklessness. None of us really know where that\ntipping point is. But with each dollar of Treasury and MBS purchases the FOMC instructs the\nNew York desk to make, we inch closer to it.\nFor the remainder of Ben Bernanke’s leadership and from the very first moment of his\nsuccessor’s, the FOMC will have to astutely maneuver so as to avoid crossing a line that no\nNobel laureate or econometric modeler or quant-jock or dealer or market operator can identify\nex-ante.\nI admit to a preoccupation with this concern. This much I know: As long as inflationary\nexpectations are held at bay, we can fully open the monetary throttle in an effort to deliver on the\nmandate Congress gave us to help achieve full employment. But it is for naught as long as the\nfiscal authorities are slamming on the brakes and leaving everyone in the dark as to how they\nwill cure the fiscal mess they have wrought.\nNo rational businesswoman or man will or should make a long-term commitment to expanding\ntheir workforce or commit their precious capital to significant job-creating projects if they have\nno idea what their taxes will be or how government spending will impact them or their customers\nor suppliers. And no manager can plan or budget forward while simultaneously working under\nthe yoke of ever-expanding regulations that render incalculable their cost structure, including the\nfull-in cost of the most important variable in that cost structure—the workforce—as long as the\nAffordable Care Act remains more of a mystery than a clear, understandable program.\nThe creative capacity of American business for dealing with uncertainty is unparalleled. But\ndoubts caused by fiscal malfunctioning so extreme that the “risk-free rate” of the world’s largest\n3\n\n\feconomy and reserve currency is called into question are of a different kind and character than\nthe everyday uncertainties that even the most gifted manager is trained to handle. How does one\ndiscount the value of payables and receivables for next year when the world wonders if the U.S.\ngovernment will validate the full value of Treasury bills?\nThe Fed to the Rescue?\nIt is true that unlike the Congress, the FOMC actually makes decisions and does so in a civil\nmanner—both lost traits in Washington. But it is a myth that we have the power on our own to\npropel our economy forward. We can provide the fuel, but we can’t engage the gears of the\nengine of employment. Only businesses can do that. And businesses cannot do it when they\nhaven’t an inkling of how the fiscal mess that is Washington will be resolved. The simple\nobservation is that U.S. businesses and households need confidence that fiscal policy will be\nconducted responsibly—that revenues and expenditures will come into line, over time. Until that\nfog is lifted, do not expect the economy to steam forward at anything but a most cautious pace.\nAnnus Horribilis or …\nIn contemplating the fix we are in, I thought of a phrase used by Queen Elizabeth in her 1992\nspeech, marking the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. You may recall that was a\nyear when a series of tragedies, including the burning of Windsor Castle, beset her family. With\nclassic British understatement, she told her subjects: “1992 is not a year on which I shall look\nback with undiluted pleasure. … it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis’”—a “horrible\nyear.”4\nWe have suffered much on the financial and economic front these past many years. And, in fact,\nsince 1976 we have on 17 occasions under six of the last seven U.S. presidents experienced a\nfederal government disruption, including shutdowns. Since 2010, we have had eight budget\nconventions, to no avail. And we’ve seen several face-offs on the debt ceiling. But the\ncumulative effect of our government’s fiscal ineptitude and propensity to put off taking action on\nhard decisions, and the frustration I feel about the inability of even the most radical monetary\npolicy to work in the absence of long-term fiscal probity, has tempted me to record 2013 as an\nannus horribilis. It is certainly not shaping up to be a year on which I shall look back with\nundiluted pleasure.\nSound but Disagreeable\nIt need not be so horrible, however. In fact, it may be a year of good fortune if our president and\ncongressional leaders summon the courage to put partisan gamesmanship aside and finally craft\ntax and spending and regulatory policy that encourages businesses to take the cheap and\nabundant money the Fed has made possible—the cheapest in the 237-year history of the\nRepublic!—and put it to use creating jobs and expanding the wealth of the entire nation, not just\nthat of rich and quick financiers and those with the means to speculate and profit from volatility.\n\n4\n\n\fGetting these incentives right is not an easy task. But it is crucial.\nOne of the most exalted of the Economic Club’s long history of speakers, Winston Churchill,\nsaid, “In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is\ndisagreeable.” Continuing down the path of hypermonetary accommodation is certainly\nagreeable, especially if you are invested in stocks or bonds or have been able to refinance your\nmortgage and participate in the new housing boom. But carried on for too long, it is surely an\nunsound way to put our nation back on the path to respectability or eliminate the markets’\nplacing haircuts on the value of U.S. Treasuries.\nThe only way for us to achieve sound footing is for our fiscal leaders to make politically\ndisagreeable decisions. There is no other way for us to regain and maintain our standing as the\nmost prosperous and powerful economy in the history of the world.\nAnnus Mirabilis?\nI mentioned Queen Elizabeth’s annus horribilis. So as to not leave you despondent, I wish to\nremind you that the queen’s expression was a play on words in a poem written in 1667 by John\nDryden, titled Annus Mirabilis—or Year of Miracles.\nDryden was writing about the year that spanned 1665 and 1666. It began with the Great Plague\nof London—a pandemic akin to the bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned\nLondon for five days.\nSo why the title Year of Miracles? Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose\nfrom the ashes, with wide streets and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by\nChristopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our collective task is to\nturn the current annus horribilis into an opportunity to emerge from the current fiscal wreckage\nstronger and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans,\nwho have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it\nnow.\nI am tempted to remind you of how Texas arose from the ashes of the 1980s oil bust and savingsand-loan crisis to lead the nation in job creation for several decades and become one of our most\nprosperous states. But I am not going to do so.\nI was going to tell you how in the Texas renaissance, as the U.S. has seen job destruction in the\ntwo middle-income quartiles for the past decade, Texas has seen job creation in those same\nmiddle-income groups and has outperformed the nation in creating jobs in the highest-income\nquartile, too. But I won’t.\n\n5\n\n\fI am tempted to tell you that Texas came off the bottom to become the top exporting state in the\nUnited States. But I shan’t. Or that state laws and regulations crafted with the 1980s banking\ncrisis in mind spared Texas the worst of the recent housing crisis.\nAll these factors, of which I won’t breathe a word, have resulted in a workforce of some 12.8\nmillion and, in 2006, catapulted the state to its ranking as the top destination for people who\nmove across states. Americans and immigrants alike come to Texas to seek jobs and opportunity\nin what continues to be the nation’s most dynamic economy. I could tell you about that, but I will\nrefrain from Texas brag.\nNew York, New York\nInstead, let me point to New York as an example of what is possible.\nSome of you may remember the predicament in which New York found itself in 1975, the year I\ncame to work at Brown Brothers. It was de facto bankrupt. Garbage piled up on the streets.\nCrime was rampant. Upper East Side apartments could be had simply for the assumption of\nmaintenance costs. Nothing worked. Everything was dysfunctional. The outlook was so horrific\nthat Mick Jagger wrote “Shattered” after a cab ride around the city. Remember the lyrics? “What\na mess, this town’s in tatters/I’ve been shattered, my brain’s been battered/Splattered all over\nManhattan …”\nThen, when the markets showed the city the back of its hand, leaders such as Felix Rohatyn and\nGov. [Hugh] Carey and others stepped up to the plate. They and the people of New York turned\nsomething truly horribilis into a thing mirabilis. Disagreeable but sound decisions were made.\nThose decisions took a tattered, shattered city and put it on the path to becoming the bright,\nshiny, miraculous Big Apple that it is today.\nA Plea\nThe Federal Reserve is limited in its power to make what took place in New York happen for our\nnation, and unless the fiscal authorities get their act together, looking to the Fed to solve the\nnation’s economic ills through ever-expansive monetary policy might well make the situation\nworse. So I end with a plea for our president and our Congress. The markets are restless. Your\npeers around the world are afraid. There is little remaining tolerance for agreeable but unsound\ndecisions. The bond market is beginning to show us the back of its hand. It is time for leadership.\nTurning something horrible into something miraculous is the American thing to do. Please get on\nwith it.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nAs quoted in “Infamous ‘Drop Dead’ Was Never Said by Ford,” by Sam Roberts, New York Times, Dec. 28, 2006.\n\n6\n\n\f2\n\n“Asia Moves to Protect Itself, Just in Case,” by Jeremy Grant and Paul J.

Fisher en la ocasion del lanzamiento del nuevo billete de\n$100\n8 de octubre 2013 Houston\nMuchas gracias por venir. Hoy es un día muy importante en la historia de nuestra moneda.\nEstamos aquí hoy para anunciar la puesta en circulación del nuevo y mejorado billete de 100\ndólares, siendo este la pieza más sofisticada de moneda que se haya producido hasta la\nfecha en los Estados Unidos.\nEl billete de 100 dólares es el billete americano de mayor circulación a nivel mundial y\ntambién el más falsificado en todo el mundo, por eso esta nueva nota incorpora nueva\ntecnología para combatir la falsificación.\nSe estima que casi dos tercios de los billetes de 100 dólares circulan fuera de los Estados\nUnidos. Por eso es importante para nuestra nación prevenir la falsificación de la moneda y\nmantener su integridad.\nA partir de hoy - cualquier banco comercial, caja de ahorro o unión de crédito que ordene\nbilletes de 100 dólares de la Reserva Federal recibirá este nuevo diseño. El público lo tendrá\nen sus manos en cuestión de días.\nComo ustedes ya saben, los billetes de los Estados Unidos son impresos en el Bureau of\nEngraving and Printing el cual forma parte del Departamento del Tesoro. El BEP (por sus\nsiglas en inglés) entrega los billetes a los doce bancos de la Reserva Federal, a quienes les\ncorresponde ponerlos en circulación a través de las instituciones financieras. A nosotros en la\nReserva Federal nos gusta señalar que todos los billetes en circulación son técnicamente\nnotas de la Reserva Federal.\nTodos los dólares estadounidenses son impresos por el BEP en dos sitios: Washington, DC, y\nFort Worth, Texas. Estos son los dos únicos lugares en el mundo donde se imprime,\nlegalmente, la moneda de los Estados Unidos.\nEstamos especialmente orgullosos del nuevo billete de 100 dólares, ya que la gran mayoría\nde ellos han sido impresos en Fort Worth. Cuando usted reciba uno, fíjese que hay una\npequeña \"FW\" en la parte delantera, indicando que ese billete tiene su origen en las\ninstalaciones de Fort Worth.\n¡Así que en este gran estado de Texas - con su economía fuerte- hacemos dinero, pero\ntambién el dinero se hace!\n\n\fA lo mejor quieren saber ¿qué tiene de especial este billete, además de sus raíces en Texas?\nContiene varias medidas de seguridad contra la falsificación, pero el público pronto se dará\ncuenta de dos cosas en particular.\nEn primer lugar, en la parte frontal del billete, ustedes encontrarán una cinta azul de\nseguridad 3-D (tercera dimensión). Esta cinta está tejida en el papel, no impresa en él.\nAdemás, la cinta de seguridad tiene imágenes de la Campana de la Libertad y el número 100.\nSi mueven el billete hacia adelante y hacia atrás, las campanas se transforman en el número\ncien y se mueven de un lado a otro. Si mueven el billete de un lado a otro, las campanitas y el\nnúmero cien se mueven de arriba a abajo.\nLa segunda medida de seguridad que ustedes notarán en el frente del billete será una\ncampana dentro de un tintero. Tanto la campana como el tintero son de color cobre. Sin\nembargo, cuando se inclina el billete, la campana cambia de color cobre a color verde.\nEl nuevo billete conserva la marca de agua del retrato de Benjamin Franklin, visible cuando\nse pone el billete contra la luz.\nEstas medidas de seguridad se incorporan para disuadir la falsificación de nuestra moneda y,\nprevenir, por lo tanto, las grandes pérdidas que ese delito podría ocasionar a consumidores y\nempresarios. Verificar la autenticidad del nuevo billete de 100 dólares solo toma unos\nsegundos.\nEn pocas palabras – el nuevo billete es difícil de falsificar pero sobre todo su autenticidad es\nfácil comprobar.\nRecuerden, si ustedes reciben un billete falso - de cualquier denominación - no lo podrá\ncambiar por un billete auténtico. Así que es importante saber cómo distinguir los billetes\nbuenos de los falsos.\nEsta plática podría dar la impresión de que la falsificación de dólares es muy común pero no\nes así. Muy pocos billetes se reportan como falsos en los Estados Unidos.\nEste nuevo billete de 100 dólares sirve para asegurar que los Estados Unidos se mantienen a\nla vanguardia de la tecnología contra la falsificación en todo el mundo.\nEs importante que el público sepa que no es necesario cambiar sus billetes viejos de 100\ndólares por los nuevos. Todos los diseños de los diferentes billetes en circulación conservan\nsu valor y son aceptados como modo de pago. Los Estados Unidos nunca ha retirado del\nmercado billetes con diseños anteriores y mucho menos devaluado la moneda a raíz de la\nintroducción de nuevos billetes.\nLos billetes con diseños antiguos eventualmente llegan a la Reserva Federal a través de las\ninstituciones bancarias. Una vez en la Reserva Federal, los billetes viejos no aptos para seguir\nen circulación son reciclados, es decir los mandamos al cielo del dinero.\nEste proceso asegura que el dinero que el público recibe de los bancos sea seguro y esté en\nbuenas condiciones.\n\n\fCon esto concluyo mi presentación. Gracias por venir. Nos quedamos aquí varios\nfuncionarios de la Reserva Federal - incluyéndome a mí – a su disposición y encantados de\nresponder a sus preguntas.\nNotes\n\nLas opiniones expresadas por el autor no reflejan necesariamente las posiciones oficiales de\nla Reserva Federal.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W.

            "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nRemarks for $100 Bill Launch\nRichard Fisher's remarks for $100 Bill Launch at Houston Branch\nOctober 8, 2013 Houston\nThank you for coming. This is a significant day in the life of U.S. currency.\nWe are here today to announce that we are putting into general circulation the newly\nredesigned $100 bill — which is the most sophisticated piece of currency the United States\nhas ever produced.\nThe $100 note is the most widely circulated and most often counterfeited U.S. bill around\nthe world, and this new note incorporates advanced technology to combat counterfeiting.\nWe estimate that nearly two-thirds of $100 bills circulate outside the U.S. That is why it’s\nimportant for our nation to stay ahead of counterfeiting and maintain the integrity of our\ncurrency.\nStarting today — any commercial bank, savings and loan, or credit union that orders $100\nnotes from the Federal Reserve will receive this new design. Consumers can expect to find it\nin their hands in a matter of days, depending upon where they bank.\nAs you know, U.S. currency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, an arm of the\nTreasury Department. The BEP then ships the bills to the Federal Reserve Banks, which put\nthem into circulation through financial institutions. We at the Federal Reserve like to point\nout that all U.S. bills are technically Federal Reserve Notes.\nAll U.S. currency is printed at the BEP’s plants in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas.\nThose are the only two places in the world where U.S. money is printed — legally printed.\nWe are particularly proud of the new $100 note because the vast majority of them have\nbeen printed in Fort Worth. When you receive one, you may notice a small “FW” printed on\nthe front. This, of course, designates the work of the Fort Worth facility.\nSo in this great state — with its strong economy — not only do we make money in Texas, but\nwe make money in Texas.\nSo what’s so special about this bill, besides its Texas roots? There are a good number of anticounterfeiting measures designed into this new issuance, but consumers will quickly notice\ntwo new features.\nFirst, on the front of the note, you’ll find a blue 3-D security ribbon. This ribbon is woven into\nthe paper, not printed on it. The ribbon features images of the Liberty Bell and the numeral\n100.\n\n\fIf you tilt the note back and forth, the bells change to100s as they move side to side. If you\ntilt the note side to side, the bells and 100s move up and down.\nAlso, on the front, there is a bell in an inkwell. This is a color-shifting bell inside a copper\ninkwell. The inkwell and bell are both copper. When you tilt the note back and forth, the bell\nchanges from copper to green.\nThe bill retains the watermark portrait of Benjamin Franklin, visible when you hold the bill up\nto light.\nThese anti-counterfeiting measures are incorporated not only to deter bad guys from\nreplicating our money, but also to help protect consumers and business operators from\nlosses. It only takes a few seconds to check the new $100 bill to make sure it’s real.\nSimply put — these bills are hard to replicate but easy to authenticate.\nRemember, if you receive a counterfeit bill — of any denomination — you cannot turn it in\nfor a genuine note. So it’s important to know what real money looks like.\nAll of this may lead people to believe there is a large-scale counterfeiting problem in the U.S.,\nand that’s not the case. Few U.S. notes are reported counterfeit.\nThis new $100 note is our latest proactive step to ensure America stays ahead of\ncounterfeiting technology around the world.\nIt’s important for consumers to know that it is not necessary to trade in their old $100 bills\nfor new ones. All designs of U.S. currency remain legal tender, regardless of when they were\nissued. The United States has never recalled, de-monetized or de-valued its currency as\nupdated bills were issued.\nAs the older designs make their way through the banking system, they will eventually get\nreturned to the Federal Reserve, where they will be recycled. We think of it as sending the\nold bills to money heaven.\nThis process ensures that the money consumers receive from banks is safe, fit and secure.\nThank you all for coming.\nThis concludes our formal remarks, but we have several officials here from the Federal\nReserve — including myself — who will be happy to answer your questions.\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W. Fisher served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from\nApril 2005 until his retirement in March 2015.\n\n\f\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas\nOctober 3, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fUncertainty Matters\n(With Reference to Kinky Monetary Policy, Two Nickels and a Dime)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Evan [Koenig].1\nIt is a pleasure to share this platform with John Taylor. I first met John at a Carnegie Foundation\nseminar when he was Undersecretary of the Treasury; I have been among the legions of his\nadmirers ever since. He is thoughtful, no-nonsense and, importantly, dedicated to making\nmonetary policy work with maximum efficacy. We at the Dallas Fed are grateful that he chairs\nthe advisory board of our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. And we all, as\nAmericans, are grateful for his service and dedication to our country. Thank you, John, for being\nthe good patriot and man that you are.\nUncertainty Matters\nUncertainty matters. A lot.\nThis won’t be a surprise to many of you. The first thing you are taught in any MBA program, be\nit at Stanford, where I earned my degree, or anywhere else, is that “business” is the process of\nmanaging under conditions of uncertainty. All business executives worth their salt organize their\nteams and resources to minimize uncertainty of factors under their control; and they develop\ncontingencies and operating tactics and strategies for factors over which they have no direct\ncontrol. Obviously, the less-clear external influences are, the greater the degree of angst about\nbudgeting and planning for the future. Even the saltiest of helmsmen cannot confidently navigate\na ship in a dense fog.\nGoing back to the earliest days of the current recovery, my business contacts have regularly\ncomplained of the fog of uncertainty emanating from Washington: They have consistently cited\nfiscal and regulatory uncertainty as major impediments to capital investment and expanding\npayrolls. Given uncertainty about the implications for overhead of the Affordable Care Act and\nother government mandates, they’ve complained of not knowing what their all-in labor and other\ncosts will be and of how that lack of knowledge has made long-term employment planning\nnearly impossible. I’m sure that many of you have heard similar complaints—or have voiced\nthem yourselves.\nWhat you may not realize is that until quite recently, economists who study business cycles and\nmonetary policy paid scant attention to the effects of uncertainty on aggregate job and output\ngrowth. The profession’s standard models assume that the economy is populated with\nhouseholds and firms that are identical to one another, or that people and businesses can insure\naway individual risk and so are effectively, theoretically, identical. It’s become standard practice,\ntoo, to assume that decision-makers are hyper-rational in how they form their expectations of\nfuture policy and future events; they are assumed to fully understand how the economy works.\nTo be sure, the economy is subject to shocks, so that its course is unpredictable. But that\nuncertainty, according to this school of theory, is of no real consequence for households’\n1\n\n\fdecisions about how much to save and consume, or businesses’ decisions about how much to\nhire and invest. The technical term is “certainty equivalence”: In standard models, choices\ndepend on what you expect will happen and not on the degree to which you are confident in your\npredictions.\nSuch thinking is far removed from reality and, thankfully, there’s increasing recognition of that\nfact. A variety of uncertainty indexes have been developed and their importance in theory and in\npractice examined.2 Pretty uniformly, these studies suggest that changes in uncertainty have\nsignificant economic effects and that uncertainty has been elevated in recent years.\nIn theoretical analyses, the impact of uncertainty is especially great when realistic financial and\ninformational frictions prevent risk from being spread optimally. Because of such frictions, for\nexample, debt contracts often require that borrowers post collateral. When uncertainty increases,\nso do collateral requirements, tightening credit and increasing the value of “safe” assets relative\nto other assets.3\nThere’s more than one type of uncertainty. There’s uncertainty about future average tax rates on\ninvestment income, for example, or the future pace of average labor productivity gains. This is\naggregate uncertainty. There is also uncertainty that widens the distribution of asset returns\nacross firms or the distribution of income prospects across households, while leaving aggregate\naverage asset returns and aggregate average productivity prospects unchanged. This is crosssectional uncertainty. Finally, there’s the uncertainty that you feel when you think that you\nunderstand how the world works and then discover that you don’t because something happens\nthat you thought unlikely to happen.4 In the extreme, these are “black swan” events: the “oh spit”\nmoments we experience when we realize that we have fundamentally and disastrously\nmiscalculated.\nBlack swans induce paradigm shifts: The world—or, at least, our thinking about the world—is\nnever the same again. The Great Depression was one such event. The housing-market collapse\nthat began in 2006 and then spilled over to financial markets is another. If the U.S. government\ndefaults on its debt later this month, we’ll have a third example. The unthinkable will have\nbecome real, and the “full faith and credit” of the United States will be a mirage rather than\naccepted fact.\nThere are myriad other events that, on a much smaller scale, lead people to question their\nunderstanding of the rules. For example, the recent decision of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) to maintain the pace of its large-scale asset purchases in the face of a\ngenerally improving labor market outlook and a widespread perception within financial markets,\nright or wrong, that the Fed had telegraphed a dialing back of the rate of purchases may have\nincreased uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy. That was one argument raised\nagainst the decision not to taper. I know, because I made the argument, and I was not alone.\nMost real-world fiscal and regulatory uncertainty is a mix of aggregate and cross-sectional\nuncertainty. Given the aging of the U.S. population, we know that the revenues required to\nfinance entitlement programs will certainly have to increase in coming decades. “Entitlement\nreform” may ameliorate the problem but won’t eliminate it. Government purchases will have to\nbe cut, relative to baseline projections, and tax revenues will certainly have to be increased. But\n2\n\n\fexactly which programs will be cut and which taxes increased, and when, is unclear and has been\nfurther muddled by the behavior of fiscal policy makers these past few days.\nThe financial crisis and subsequent recession exacerbated these problems by increasing the\noutstanding stock of debt. U.S. federal government debt held by the public has increased from 34\npercent of potential GDP at the business-cycle peak in first quarter 2001 (shortly before the 9/11\nattacks) to 36 percent in fourth quarter 2007 (just prior to the Great Recession) to 70 percent of\npotential GDP today.\nThis increased debt has been manageable as a result of a substantial fall in interest rates. Indeed,\ninterest on the public debt has trended downward from 4.7 percent of potential GDP in 1990 to\n3.2 percent in 2007 to just 2.1 percent in 2012 as the average interest rate on Treasury securities\nhas dropped from 9 percent to 5 percent, then to its recent level of 2½ percent. Rates obviously\ncannot continue to fall, though, so the cost of servicing debt is sure to increase, even if the size of\nthe debt relative to the economy stabilizes.\nThe Canary in the Mine: Capital Investment\nCapital investment is the economy’s canary in the mine because it’s often the first thing to\nsuccumb to uncertainty. Also, once undertaken, capital investment is costly to reverse.\nInvestment has certainly been unusually sluggish in the wake of the recent recession. Going back\nto when our data begin, in 1947, net investment as a percent of GDP has fluctuated around a\nconstant mean of 5.6 percent.5 It boomed in the late 1990s, reaching 8.1 percent of GDP, its\nhighest level in over 50 years. The only higher quarter on record was the second quarter of 1950\n(shortly after John Taylor and I came into this world, although I am not implying causality). Its\npeak during the 2001–07 expansion was an unremarkable 6.9 percent, but the subsequent plunge\nwas unprecedented in the post-World War II data: The U.S. capital stock actually shrank during\nthe second half of 2009. Relative to its 5.6 percent long-run average, net investment as a percent\nof GDP fell by twice as far as it had in any prior postwar recession.\nMore to the point, the recovery in investment has been exceptionally anemic. Today, four full\nyears after the trough of the recession in second quarter 2009, net investment as a percent of\nGDP is still only 3.2 percent—a level typical of past recession lows. Net investment as a percent\nof GDP was last at or above its 5.6 percent long-run mean 6½ years ago.\nSmall wonder then that nonfarm payroll employment has been slow to recover too. Through\nAugust we had restored less than 80 percent of the 8.7 million jobs lost during the Great\nRecession. Less well known is the fact that real GDP per capita only recovered its prerecession\npeak this past summer.6 That’s 5½ years to make up the ground lost during the recession.\nPrevious post-WWII recoveries never required more than nine quarters maximum. A Dallas Fed\nanalysis suggests that the recent financial crisis and its aftermath put the U.S. back by more than\nan entire year’s worth of output, an equivalent of more than $120,000 per American household.7\nBaker-Bloom-Davis and Better Comprehending Uncertainty\nAnd what of uncertainty? I mentioned earlier that we now have several uncertainty indexes. One\nof these, focused on measuring policy uncertainty, was developed by our moderator, Nick\nBloom, together with Scott Baker at Stanford and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago.\nThe index is based on three different types of information: (1) a count of articles referencing\n3\n\n\funcertainty, the economy and policy that have appeared in prominent U.S. newspapers\n(including the nation’s premier paper, the Dallas Morning News); (2) a weighted count of taxcode provisions that are scheduled to expire; and (3) the extent to which professional forecasters\ndisagree with one another about future levels of inflation and government purchases.\nThe Baker-Bloom-Davis index begins in January 1985 and runs through the present. High values\nof the index signal an elevated level of economic policy uncertainty. From 1985 through 2007—\nprior to the 2008–09 recession—the index has a mean of 94, and it exceeds 150 only 2 percent of\nthe time (one month in 50; just six times in over 23 years). The index rose to above-average\nlevels in the fall of 2007 and stayed at or above 94—but below 150—through the summer of\n2008. Then, between August and September 2008, the index nearly doubled, rising from 96 to\n188. Since September 2008, the index has at no time dropped below 100, and it has exceeded\n150 on 31 occasions—more than half the time. It has soared above 200 twice: for two months in\n2011, coincident with that year’s debt-ceiling debate, and in December 2012, when a\ncompromise implementation of sequestration was being hammered out. It’ll be interesting to see\nwhat happens with the index in the wake of the past week’s developments (or lack thereof) in\nWashington.\nThe point is that starting with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, economic\npolicy uncertainty has been consistently high, and half the time it has been extraordinarily high.\nIt’s difficult to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that this elevated uncertainty is causally\nrelated to the weak recovery we’ve experienced. But the hypothesis is surely sensible, the timing\nis certainly auspicious, and enough careful confirming analysis has been done to say that the\npreponderance of evidence favors the proposition that not just recent policy decisions, but also\nthe manner in which those decisions were arrived at, have been a significant hindrance to\neconomic expansion.\nThe Kinky Stuff: Monetary Policy\nAs to monetary policy, I would submit there are several links between monetary policy and\neconomic uncertainty. First, though, some background.\nOrdinarily, monetary policy works by influencing the current and expected near-term levels of\nshort-term interest rates. Once short-term interest rates hit zero, however, the Fed turned to\nunconventional policies. By using massive purchases of longer-term Treasuries and agency\nmortgage-backed securities, these policies helped hold down term premia and support the\nhousing recovery. Simultaneously, the Fed tried—and I emphasize tried because the message\nseems to have been garbled in the minds of some intended recipients—to influence expectations\nof its own behavior once asset purchases have run their course. These “asset-purchase” and\n“forward-guidance” policies are relatively unfamiliar, and their impact is uncertain.\nOne implication is that aggregate fiscal shocks—and, hence, also aggregate fiscal uncertainties—\nare likely to have outsize effects in current circumstances. Contractionary fiscal policy that\nwould ordinarily drive down interest rates, providing offsetting stimulus to private expenditure,\nwill have a larger-than-typical economic impact because this “crowding in” is absent once\ninterest rates are confined to the zero lower bound. Expansionary fiscal policy, similarly, will fail\nto “crowd out” private expenditure if interest rates hold steady.\n\n4\n\n\fSecond, because the zero bound complicates the conduct of monetary policy and short-circuits\nfiscal crowding out, it introduces a “kink,” or discontinuity, in the economy’s behavior. The\nexistence of a kink means that uncertainty matters even if ordinarily it would not: “Certainty\nequivalence” no longer applies. When real growth and/or inflation prospects are weak—so that\nthe economy is operating near the zero bound—downside risks to growth and inflation loom\nlarger than they ordinarily would. More-aggressive-than-usual policy responses may be\nappropriate to avoid the negative implications of an encounter with the zero bound.\nParadoxically, though, once the lower bound on interest rates is binding, a less-than-usuallyaggressive monetary policy response may be appropriate. I have tried to articulate this in FOMC\nmeetings ever since we started down the path of quantitative easing, drawing on anecdotal\nreports from my CEO contacts and what I thought was common sense. But my arguments fell on\ndeaf ears until my more learned counterpart at the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, produced a\nformal study that posited that the aggressive use of unfamiliar policy tools like quantitative\neasing and Operation Twist add to aggregate economic uncertainty and, if applied at all, should\nbe deployed more cautiously than our more familiar tools.8\nLarge Margins of Error\nIn general, the objective of monetary policy is to provide households and firms with an economic\nenvironment that makes it attractive to use money as medium of exchange and store of value.\nSince many private contracts, including labor and debt contracts as well as capital expenditure\ncommitments, extend out several years, a multiyear policy perspective is needed. A multiyear\nperspective is especially important when the economy may encounter the zero bound. The\nexplanation is that by interfering with the normal conduct of monetary policy, the zero bound\nincreases the likelihood that policy will miss its objectives year after year in the same direction,\nso that the errors accumulate over time.\nOver the past five years, for example, PCE inflation has averaged 1.2 percent per year. The\nFOMC’s announced long-term inflation objective is 2.0 percent. Over a single year, the\ndifference between 1.2 percent and 2.0 percent inflation is inconsequential. Over five years,\nthough, that small difference cumulates to a 4.26 percentage point difference in the price level,\nwhich is not insignificant, perhaps, if back in 2008 you took out a mortgage with a five-year\nballoon. Alternatively, nominal GDP growth over the past five years has averaged 2.4 percent\nper year, when ordinarily one might have expected 4.5 percent average annual growth (2.5\npercent real growth plus 2.0 percent inflation). Again, the difference is inconsequential in any\ngiven year. Accumulated over five years, though, the level of nominal income today is fully 12\npercent below what might reasonably have been expected when mortgage and auto loan\nagreements were made back in 2008.\nKindly note that I am not advocating any change to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. My\npoint is simply to highlight the longer-term consequences of what might appear to be smallish,\nshorter-term deviations from the norm. Business operators plan capital expenditure and payrolls\nnot in one- or two- or even three-year increments; they plan and budget over longer-term\nhorizons. The nominal stability that people need if they are going to negotiate multiyear\ncontracts is a multiyear nominal stability. A policy that “lets bygones be bygones” from year to\nyear may not achieve this kind of stability, especially when policy options can become\nconstrained, in the short term, by the zero bound. A policy that takes a longer-term perspective\nand is properly communicated and executed—so as to instill confidence that monetary policy\n5\n\n\fwill hew to a 2 percent inflation target rather than fixate on the run-rate of the past four quarters\nor the outlook for the next four—may better supply the longer-term comfort that households and\nbusinesses need to plan and budget. Such a policy would reduce the uncertainty that monetary\npolicy as it is currently conducted spawns and would be more effective in doing its part to assist\nin economic expansion.9\nA Dime Between Two Nickels\nI hope this is enough to get a conversation started. I will now turn the microphone over to John\nTaylor. In doing so, I am reminded of Ross Perot’s quip when he was placed between Bill\nClinton and George H.W. Bush for a predebate photograph in the 1992 presidential election.\nNoting that Mr. Perot was substantially shorter than the other two men, a reporter asked him how\nhe felt. His reply: “I feel like a dime between two nickels.” In contrast, compared to John Taylor,\nI feel like an intellectual dwarf—a mere penny sitting on the dais next to John’s $100 bill brain.\nAnd I’m talking about the new, difficult to replicate $100 bill that will be released next Tuesday.\nPlease join me in welcoming John Taylor to the podium.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nThe speaker is indebted to Dallas Fed Senior Vice President and Principal Policy Advisor Evan Koenig for his\ninput in developing the themes articulated in this speech.\n2\nUncertainty indexes are described and analyzed in the following recent papers: “Measuring Economic Policy\nUncertainty,” by Scott R.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio\nSeptember 23, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fReview, Reflect and Deflect\n(With Reference to the Texas Ratio, ‘Super-Spreaders’\nand Three Great Newspapers)\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Chris [Williston]. I am honored and delighted to speak to you all today. I understand\nthat Danny King’s daughter, Amy, arranged quite a songwriters’ show for you last night. I heard\nit was so good that Ann Worthy, my head regulator at the Dallas Fed, stayed up past midnight ...\nfor the first time in 40 years.\nI am going to start today by reviewing current banking trends for the nation and for the Eleventh\nFederal Reserve District.\nThen, as there has been a great deal of reflection in the press and blogosphere on the occasion of\nthe fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and the ensuing global financial crisis, I\nwant to briefly provide you an overview of what the crisis cost us as a nation and the work\nremaining to prevent a reoccurrence of a crisis, a subject I will be addressing in a more fulsome\nmanner in a speech and a public debate in New York in mid-October.\nLast, I will comment briefly on last week’s FOMC meeting and what some have referred to as\n“the taper caper,” doing my utmost to deflect your criticism.\nTexas’ Superior Bank Performance\nFirst, let’s discuss how banks in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District are performing in the\ncontext of national trends. Recall that the district includes some 27 million people sprawled\nacross approximately 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded\nnorth of Louisiana. Over 96 percent of the economic output and the district’s banking assets are\nin Texas, so you might reasonably say I am speaking of the performance of Texas banks versus\nbanks in the U.S. as a whole.\n\n1\n\n\fNational Trends\n\n• Profitability continues to improve\n• Provision expense has fallen below precrisis\nlevels\n• Asset quality problems continue to moderate\n• Bank lending activity continues to rebound\n\nProfitability is fairly strong across the nation, helped in part by a continued decline in provision\nexpense. Asset quality continues to improve, and lending activity continues to grow nationally.\nThese national trends are consistent with what we have seen over the last several quarters.\nYou should take pride in knowing that Eleventh District and Texas banks are outperforming the\nrest of the nation’s banks.\nLet’s look at comparative return on assets (ROA):\n\n2\n\n\fReturn on Assets\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nProfitability trends over the last several years as measured by ROA show that district banks\ncontinue to outperform banks nationwide, with an ROA of 1.15 percent versus 1.12 percent for\nall U.S. banks.\nWhile moving in the right direction, banks still have a little more work to do before their\nprofitability reaches precrisis levels.\nProvision expense is worth noting:\n\n3\n\n\fProvision Expense\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nFalling provision expense has contributed to improved earnings trends for both U.S. and district\nbanks. Declines in the amount banks set aside to cover bad loans have importantly contributed to\nimproved profitability over the last several years. This, however, is not likely to be the case\nmoving forward.\nBanks nationwide and in the district are now reporting provisions below precrisis levels. In the\ncase of our district banks, provision expense as a percentage of average assets is almost half of\nwhat was reported in 2006.\nIt doesn’t look like profitability is going to be bolstered much by net interest margin (NIM),\neither.\n\n4\n\n\fNet Interest Margin\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n\nThe NIM for banks across the U.S. has continued to trend lower over the past two decades; in the\ndistrict, the trend has been observed over the past decade. It is noteworthy that the most recent\ndecline in NIM is certainly affected by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.1\nAs you can see in this chart, district banks continue to report a slightly higher margin at 3.33\npercent versus 3.25 percent for banks nationwide.\nNow let’s look at how profitability differs nationally by bank asset size:\n\n5\n\n\fReturn on Assets by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nROA has considerably improved in all size classes—banks with asset sizes of less than $10\nbillion and between $10 billion and $250 billion, and the largest banks, those with assets greater\nthan $250 billion.\nThe upward trend in ROA tapers off by 2013 for community and midsize banks, while\nprofitability for the dozen or so big banks—the cohort that includes banks considered “too big to\nfail” (TBTF)—shoots up rather dramatically. The Big Guys earned a ROA of 1.26 percent versus\n1.04 percent for the community banks.\nThis chart shows the major profitability components for the asset size classes we just discussed:\n\n6\n\n\fProfitability by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks — June 30, 2013\n\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nStarting from the bottom up, you can see that the ROA for the biggest banks is 22 basis points\nabove that for community banks. Recall that Eleventh District banks earned 1.15 percent ROA;\nthus, the Big Guys outpace even the relatively stronger performance of our healthy banks in and\naround Texas.\nThis gap is being driven by a couple of things: The largest banks have lower noninterest expense;\nsome would say this is due to economies of scale. These Big Guys also recorded much higher\nnoninterest income—a full 100 basis points higher. These two items were more than enough to\noffset the lower net interest income reported by the biggest banks.\nHaving noted that big gap, let’s focus on the noninterest-income component for a minute and\nlook at how it has impacted earnings trends for the Big Guys.\n\n7\n\n\fNoninterest Income by Asset Size\nU.S. Banks\n\n*Data are through June 30, annualized.\n**Includes items such as ATM fees and interchange fees that are not reported by all banks.\nNOTE: Asset size group is based on organization-level assets.\n\nThis chart shows noninterest income and its components for each of the three size classes of\nbanks for 2012 and 2013.2 As you can see, noninterest income was virtually unchanged for the\ncommunity and midsize banks, while noninterest income has increased for the largest banks,\nfrom 1.89 percent of average assets in 2012 to 2.09 percent in 2013. Looking at the components\nof noninterest income, you can see that the growth has been driven by an increase in trading\nrevenue.\nTrading revenue is a noncore/nontraditional income source that is typically not available to\ncommunity and the smaller midsize banks. It is thus more difficult for these smaller institutions\nto return to their historical norms or even compete in traditional lending with the Big Guys,\nwhose lending activities, in a sense, are subsidized by their trading activities. We are receiving\nnumerous reports from community and regional banks in the Eleventh District that the lending\nterms and standards of big banks are becoming increasingly lax.\nAs you know, a common measure of asset quality is the noncurrent loan ratio, the percentage of\na bank’s loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status. Here’s a comparison of\nnoncurrent loans for U.S. versus district banks:\n\n8\n\n\fNoncurrent Loans by Loan Type\n(Percent of loans)\n\nWells FargoSouth Central\neffect\n\n*Data are as of June 30.\nNOTE: Wells Fargo-South Central added a charter in Houston in 2009,\nmoving a large volume of mortgage loans into the district.\n\nWe’ve seen fairly dramatic improvement in asset quality over the last several years, with the\nnoncurrent ratio declining to 3.07 percent for banks nationwide and 1.55 percent for those in the\ndistrict. You can see from this chart that banks in Texas and the district continue to outperform\nbanks nationwide.\nMost of you remember the legendary Bob Hankins, who retired last year after 20 years as head\nof Banking Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Bob received an award last year\nat this very luncheon. He had a saying that Texas banks were “twice as good and half as bad” as\nbanks nationwide. That remains the case, though banks around the U.S. are slowly catching up\nwith Texas, and you can also see from the chart that banks here and in the U.S. still have some\nwork to do to get noncurrent loans down to precrisis levels.\nHow about the so-called Texas ratio—a measure of noncurrent loans plus other real estate owned\nexpressed as a percentage of equity plus loan loss reserves?3 This became a scarlet letter in the\nlate 1980s when 20 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio exceeding 100 percent. However,\nin 2013 only 0.7 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio greater than 100 percent, compared\nwith 2.5 percent nationwide—and that nationwide number is down from a 5.7 percent peak in\nfourth quarter 2010.\nNote what is labeled on the center right side of the chart as the “Wells Fargo-South Central\neffect.” Wells Fargo relocated a charter to Houston in 2009 and moved a large volume of\nmortgage loans into the district, triggering the increase in nonperforming residential real estate.\n(If the Wells Fargo-South Central effect is excluded from the 2009 data, the noncurrent loan ratio\nfalls by 71 basis points for the district.)\nNow here is something I consider particularly noteworthy about our district: our loan growth and\nits composition.\n9\n\n\fLoan Growth\n\nNOTE: Data for Eleventh District banks have been adjusted to ensure consistent comparisons over time.\n\nLoan growth on a year-over-year basis remains good, but it decelerated a bit for the nation in the\nsecond quarter to 3.74 percent. In contrast, loan growth for district banks ticked up slightly to\n5.72 percent, almost 200 basis points above the nationwide average.\nOf interest, you can see from this multiyear chart that loan growth for banks nationwide hooks\ndownward in the first half of 2013, while in the district, it turns upward.\nHere’s a closer look at loan growth between June of 2012 and 2013:\n\n10\n\n\fLoan Growth\nJune 30, 2012—June 30, 2013\n\nNOTE: Eleventh District figures exclude Wells Fargo-South Central.\n\nYou can see in this chart how business loans contributed to total loan growth nationwide and in\nthe district. Business loans grew 6.8 percent for banks nationwide and 4.8 percent for those in the\ndistrict.\nWe do, however, continue to see pockets of weakness. Small-business lending was down 36\nbasis points year over year for banks in the U.S., while it increased only 1.6 percent\ndistrictwide.4\nSo let me summarize all of this:\n\n11\n\n\fConclusion\n• Both nationally and in the Eleventh District, profitability\ncontinues to improve\n• Asset quality showing slow, but steady, improvement\nacross the nation\n• Rebound in bank lending continues: Eleventh District\nbanks have expanded loans, while largest banks are\nliving off trading activity and lag in small-business\nlending\n\nProfitability continues to trend upward, although when we will make it back to precrisis levels\nremains to be seen. Asset quality is improving, but there is more work to be done. Lending\ncontinues to rebound: We’ve seen seven consecutive quarters of growth nationwide. However,\nareas of weakness remain, particularly small-business lending.\nThe issue of small-business lending and the difference between the drivers of income for the\nlargest banks and those with less than $250 billion in assets is a reminder of a lingering problem:\nThe coddling, whether intentionally or otherwise, of the biggest of the big banks—those\nconsidered too big to fail.\nFive Years After Lehman, We Still Have a Big Problem\nWorking with Harvey Rosenblum and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed, I have been a constant\nburr under the saddle of the too big to fails. In a nutshell, I believe that the megabanks are\ninherently handicapped by their size and scale in practicing the basic principle of banking: Know\nyour customer. Extreme size and complexity have proven to be the enemy of prudence and the\nsource of costly mistakes. Mathematically based risk-management models, while theoretically\ncomforting, have their deficiencies. We learned during the recent crisis just how perilous those\ndeficiencies can be.\nWe at the Dallas Fed believe, based on the experience of the last five years, that the largest\nfinancial institutions are a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy. We are not alone. Even\nthe local paper in the denizen of the megabanks, the New York Times, recently editorialized\nregarding the controversies surrounding JPMorgan Chase: “The underlying problem is not only\nthis or that violation, but the fact that the sheer size and scope and complexity of the banking\nbehemoths defy controls, encouraging speculation and bad behavior.”5\n\n12\n\n\fWe at the Dallas Fed would add that they undermine free-market capitalism and jeopardize our\neconomic welfare. But we would note that it is unfair to single out JPMorgan Chase as a culprit.\nIt is only one of a set of megabanks that remain a threat to financial stability. Indeed, Bob\nDiamond, the former head of the megabank Barclays, recently warned in a Financial Times oped that additional steps are needed “if we are to avoid the kind of capital regulatory arbitrage that\nweakened the financial system.”6\nAnd on Friday, the Wall Street Journal’s lead editorial said: “The policy of too big to fail has\nbeen codified and expanded. Dodd–Frank lets Washington’s wise men define ‘systemically\nimportant’ institutions subject to stricter regulation ... [But] Dodd–Frank’s … great conceit is\nthat in a crisis these firms will be wound down without a rescue. They even have to provide\n‘living wills’ that are supposed to plan the funeral. But the law also gives regulators the freedom\nto protect creditors as they see fit, which they will surely do in a panic. The difference next time\nwill be that more firms will be deemed too big to fail.” The Journal’s editorial highlighted this in\nbold print: “The financial system is more regulated than ever, but also no safer.”7\nIt would appear that the editors of these three great newspapers have been reading my speeches\nand Congressional testimony! They seem to agree with me and Harvey that TBTFs or\n“systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs) might easily again play the nefarious role\nthey did five years ago in bringing down our economic and financial system. (The acronym SIFI\nsounds like some kind of communicable disease transmitted through reckless behavior. In the\nevent of another crisis brought on by the behavior that SIFIs still appear to have leeway to\nengage in, my guess is the acronym would come to stand for “Save If Failure Impending”).\nAm I exaggerating when I say that the TBTFs are a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy?\nTo be sure, there were many causes and tripwires for the financial debacle from which we are\nstill struggling to recover—a debacle that we at the Dallas Fed estimate cost more than an entire\nyear’s worth of U.S. economic output, or more than $120,000 per American household.8 Among\nthose causes and tripwires were the unbridled advent of toxic forms of structured finance,\ncomplicity by the ratings agencies, and even the Fed’s own role: keeping interest rates too low\nfor too long, rebuffing Fed Governor [Edward] Gramlich’s attempts to regulate subprime\nlending, and blessing the increased consolidation of banking.\nAs my Dallas Fed colleague, John Duca, gently reminds me, there was more than a little “we\nhave met the enemy and he is us” that contributed to the perfect storm of forces that led our\neconomy into that frightful and costly tailspin.9\nBut still, the TBTF behemoths were indisputably what the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane\ncalled “super-spreaders” of the virus that brought our financial system and economy to its\nknees.10 They retain that potential today. For in the aftermath of the crisis and the passage of\nDodd–Frank, the giants have gotten bigger, and the profitability of the community and regional\nbanks that might pose meaningful, healthy competition has been undermined by the legislation’s\ncomplexity.\nDodd–Frank claims to end TBTF. Instead, as the Wall Street Journal editorialized, it entrenches\nthe TBTF pathology. The megabanks remain a potential lethal force. As mentioned, I will be\nspeaking at length on this subject in New York in October.\n13\n\n\fA Deliberate Deflection\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am going to try to avoid answering questions you\nmight have about last week’s FOMC meeting and what some in the press have now labeled “the\ntaper caper.” Nearly every Federal Reserve Bank president and his or her sister will be speaking\nto this topic this week, so you will be getting an earful of cacophonous comments on this subject.\nToday, I will simply say that I disagreed with the decision of the committee and argued against\nit. Here is a direct quote from the summation of my intervention at the table during the policy\n“go round” when Chairman [Ben] Bernanke called on me to speak on whether or not to taper:\n“Doing nothing at this meeting would increase uncertainty about the future conduct of policy and\ncall the credibility of our communications into question.” I believe that is exactly what has\noccurred, though I take no pleasure in saying so.\nEnough said. Thank you for what you do for the business and citizens of Texas. And thank you\nfor listening.\nNotes\n1\n\nSince banks borrow short-term funds from depositors and lend for longer terms, the gap between interest earned on\nloans and interest paid to depositors typically benefits from a steep yield curve, or the difference between the yields\non the 10-year Treasury bond and the three-month Treasury bill.\n2\n“Trading revenue” represents the net gains/losses from trading cash instruments and derivative contracts.\n3\nThe “Texas ratio” is defined as the ratio of loans past-due 90 days or more, nonaccrual loans, and other real estate\nowned relative to equity capital, plus loan loss reserves, less intangibles.\n4\n“Small-business loans” are commercial and industrial loans and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential property,\nwith original amounts of $1 million or less.\n5\n“Chasing JPMorgan Chase,” New York Times, Sept. 2, 2013, p.

Fisher\nEvery morning there is a quote of the day on the ubiquitous Bloomberg screens. Monday’s was\nespecially apt for today’s conference. It was from Frank Sinatra: “The best revenge is massive\nsuccess.”\nBill Simon asked me to provide context for your discussion of a manufacturing revival in the\nU.S.A. I am delighted to do so. It is well-nigh time for us to once again become a “massive\nsuccess” in manufacturing. But there are obstacles to doing so. If our manufacturing sector is to\nexperience a lasting renaissance, significant changes in fiscal policy and regulation that emanate\nfrom Washington are sorely needed.\nFirst, some historical context. Look at this chart:\n\nManufacturing Production Through the Century\nIndex, 100 = 2008:Q1\n110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n'20 '25 '30 '35 '40 '45 '50 '55 '60 '65 '70 '75 '80 '85 '90 '95 '00 '05 '10\nNOTE: Shaded areas indicate recessions.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Board.\n\nU.S. manufacturing production was ramped up to fight the Second World War and, as you can\nsee, declined precipitously after the war’s end. Then starting in 1947 or thereabouts,\nmanufacturing output in America picked up slowly at first, adjusting to a post-WWII world,\nbefore accelerating to an expansion rate of 4.6 percent per annum from the time of the election of\n1\n\n\fPresident Kennedy until Paul Volcker’s Fed broke the back of inflation and engineered a\nrecession at the end of the 1970s. During the high-tech revolution of the 1990s, manufacturing\nproduction took off at a torrid pace, then bounced back from the tech wreck of the early 2000s\nuntil hitting the brick wall of the financial panic of 2007 and the severe recession that ensued.\nThe downturn in U.S. manufacturing output during the 2007–09 recession was on the order of 20\npercent, the worst setback but for the defense-related decline following WWII and the 54 percent\ndecline experienced during the Great Depression. Manufacturing output today is still about 5\npercent below its December 2007 business-cycle peak. 1\nAs for employment, manufacturing payrolls fell 16.6 percent between December 2007 and\nJanuary 2010. They are still 12.9 percent below where they stood 5 ½ years ago.\nThis raises the issue of productivity enhancement. Look at this chart:\n\nManufacturing Share of Nonfarm Payrolls\nPercent\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n'47\n\n'52\n\n'57\n\n'62\n\n'67\n\n'72\n\n'77\n\n'82\n\n'87\n\n'92\n\n'97\n\n'02\n\n'07\n\n'12\n\nNOTE: Shaded areas indicate recessions.\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince the end of the post-WWII recession, manufacturers’ share of the nation’s payrolls has been\nin continual decline. Whereas at war’s end they represented 33 percent of nonfarm payrolls,\ntoday they account for less than 10 percent. To be sure, this reflects a rise in our nation’s\nprosperity: As nations grow richer, they produce and consume more services. Today,\nmanufacturing accounts for only about 12 percent of gross domestic product. The divergence\nbetween trends in job and output shares is largely accounted for by a relentless drive by\nmanufacturers to increase productivity. Workers today are dramatically more productive than the\n\n2\n\n\fworkers of our parents’ and grandparents’ generations because technology has enabled them to\nproduce more with fewer hours worked and at less cost.\nThis is not going to change. The iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, coined the phrase\n“creative destruction.” In plain English, this means “out with the old, in with the new.”\nAmericans are masters of replacing outdated methods with new ones.

How do we reignite and\nsustain the manufacturing renaissance?\nMonday’s front-page article of the Wall Street Journal pointed to some of the sources of strength\nin U.S. manufacturing, citing my old friend Ernie Preeg (who used to supervise me in writing\neconomic policy decision memoranda for President Carter—which means Ernie must be 110\nyears old by now, a miracle of science!) and the work done by Hal Sirkin and his colleagues at\nthe Boston Consulting Group.\nThe article cited a critical factor influencing our destiny: the revolution occurring in oil and gas\nproduction. Thanks to a Houstonian named George Mitchell and other Schumpeterian\npractitioners who defied conventional wisdom and threw out the old and embraced the new, we\nhave developed an abundance of natural gas and liquids production that are the stuff of\nproduction and the enablers of consumption. This is captured graphically here:\n\n5\n\n\fU.S. Oil and Gas Production\nMillion barrels per day\n\nBillion cubic feet per day\n\n12\n\nJune ‘13\nestimate\n\n70\n\nCrude oil\n\n10\n\n80\n\nNatural gas surges\nfrom fracking boom\n\n60\n\n8\n50\n6\n\n40\nNatural gas\n\nOil production aided\nby deep water + other\ntechnologies\n\n4\n\n30\n20\n\n2\n10\n0\n1920\n\n0\n1930\n\n1940\n\n1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\nSOURCE: Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Journal article also cited better relationships with unions and with workers in crafting\nflexible and innovative labor contracts, the rising cost of labor relative to productivity in China\nand the “world is our oyster” capacity for sales of exported U.S. manufactured goods, noting as\nexamples the overseas sales of Hypertherm and Graco.\nWhat the Journal article failed to cite is a historically profound enabler: Cheap and abundant\nmoney made possible by the Federal Reserve. I promised Bill Simon I would not venture into\nmonetary policy today, and I won’t. But I will say this: While there are many risks in the policy\nthat the Fed has been pursuing (and God and anyone who has suffered through my speeches the\npast few years knows I fret about those risks), every manufacturer of goods in America has been\ngiven a great gift by your central bank—the lowest cost of money in 237 years, an extension of\nthe roaring bond market rally that has now run 32 years, and a broad stock market rally that\nbegan in March of 2009 and has gone on to bust through all previous record highs. 2\nLook at this chart of the three-decade-old bond market rally:\n\n6\n\n\fNominal Bond Yields\nPercent\nSep.

And of course\nthere’s the slowdown in Europe and in some emerging markets. But the article skirted the most\nvexing and self-inflicted inhibitor of all: fiscal and regulatory policy of the gang that can’t shoot\nstraight in Washington.\nI have spoken of this for years.\nThe Constitution unambiguously gives the Congress of the United States control of the fiscal\npurse strings. Yet all they have done under both Republican and Democrat presidents and the\nleadership of both parties in the upper and lower houses is spend and regulate with abandon.\n\n7\n\n\fLet’s cut to the chase: The remaining obstacle to being the absolute best economy for\nmanufacturers and other businesses, bar none, has been fiscal and regulatory policy that seems\nincapable of providing job-creating manufacturers and other businesses with tax, spending and\nregulatory incentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided.\nAfter recovering most of the losses from the Great Recession, manufacturing growth has, on net,\ndecelerated in the last two years. Ask any manufacturer what holds him or her back and they will\ntell you that they can’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or\nhow government spending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their\nopinion of the impact of regulation on their businesses—from the Affordable Care Act to the\nthousands of other regulations enumerated in the Federal Register—don’t even go there, unless\nyou delight in hearing profanities. I thought my college classmate Tom Stemberg, the founder of\nStaples, was remarkably constrained in his Wall Street Journal op-ed piece today as he pointed\nout that the 50,000 jobs he created from scratch might never have occurred under what he called\ntoday’s “blizzard of bureaucratic red tape.” 3\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. American companies publicly held and private—\nlarge, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made\navailable by the Fed’s very-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular balance\nsheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory uncertainty,\nthey have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging IT, just-intime inventory management and new production structures to the max. Their workers are more\nproductive than ever.\nI believe American manufacturers today have the potential, far and away, to be the most efficient\noperators in the world. We have countless manufacturers in every sector of goods production and\nassembly that are the equivalent of the Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any\ngreat thoroughbred that has ever graced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\nThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let ’em rip,\nwe would have an economy that would take off. Instead of settling for being the “best-looking\nhorse in the glue factory,” we can become the wonder-horse that outpaces the rest of the world,\nputting the American people back to work and renewing the unparalleled magnificence of\nAmerican prosperity.\nHere is an image I want engraved in your minds. It is of Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes\nby 31 lengths in 1973, leaving his competitors in the dust.\n\n8\n\n\fSecretariat Winning 1973 Belmont Stakes by 31 Lengths\n\n© Bob Coglianese\n\nI want our manufacturers to be Secretariats, beating out the rest of the world by a stunning\nmargin. We can do it. We must do it. We must insist that Congress practice a little\nSchumpeterianism of its own: throwing out old, counterproductive fiscal and regulatory policies\nand ushering in new ones that unleash job creators from the starting gates. Then we will\nexperience a “massive success.” And as Old Blue Eyes said, that massive success will be “the\nbest revenge”—sweet revenge, indeed, on those who say that a true renaissance of American\nmanufacturing is beyond our reach.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAn alternate measure of output, called the value-added production series, shows that manufacturing output has\nnearly recovered its prerecession level.\n2\nSee remarks before the Ninth Annual Redefining Investment Strategy Education Forum, Dayton, Ohio, March 26,\n2009, www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2009/fs090326.cfm.\n3\n“A New Law to Liberate American Business,” by Thomas G.

We too have a Gordian\nKnot to untangle. Like yours, it is anxiety inducing. Let me explain it to you, and in so doing,\nsuggest that we share a common interest in the Fed succeeding in its mission.\n\nA Brief Backgrounder on the Fed\nFirst, a little background on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is the central bank of the United\nStates. We operate under a license given to us by Congress one hundred years ago, a license that\nhas been amended on occasion but has, for the most part, remained intact. The Fed provides the\nfuel for the nation’s economic engine: We print money, supplying the liquidity needed for job\ncreators to put people to work and expand the wealth and output of the nation. And we are\ncharged with regulating deposit-taking institutions to make sure they are transmitting monetary\npolicy efficiently and operating prudently.\n\n2\n\n\fWe have to be careful in deploying the fuel we create, for like all fuels, ours is combustible.\nEmployed recklessly or without safeguard, it can lead to an explosion of inflation; if we are too\nmiserly, we risk an implosion of deflation. We can spark a destructive outbreak of speculation or\ninduce excessive risk aversion. We can enhance financial stability or exacerbate systemic\ninstability.\n\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve Banks; together we operate the business of the Fed. We make\nloans to banks. We distribute Federal Reserve notes, more commonly known as “dollars,” to\nbanks. (As an aside, if you look at a dollar bill you can see by the letter printed to the left of\nGeorge Washington which Federal Reserve District it originally came from: Those with an “L”\nare the ones ordered from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing by the San Francisco Fed for\nOregon and other states that make up the Twelfth Federal Reserve District; those with a “K” are\nfrom the Dallas Fed’s Eleventh District, covering principally Texas—these, of course, are the\nmost coveted!) And the 12 Federal Reserve banks house the ground forces of bank examiners\nwho supervise and regulate banks, bank holding companies, and savings and loan companies that\nlend and provide other services to Main Street.\n\nIt might interest you to know that none of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents or their staff is\na federal employee, though we work under the watchful eye of the Federal Reserve Board whose\ngovernors and staff are. I serve at the pleasure of a nine-person board of directors, chaired by the\nfounder of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher; I do not serve at the pleasure of the president of\nthe United States, nor was I confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, led by Ben Bernanke, are federal employees who are appointed by the president and\nconfirmed by the Senate. This is the way the Federal Reserve was set up by Congress under\nPresident Wilson so as to balance power between the political exigencies of Washington and the\nfinancial and economic needs of Main Street.\n\nMaking Monetary Policy\nIn addition to doing the Main Street work of the Federal Reserve System, the presidents of the 12\nFed Banks sit down with the seven Governors of the Fed Board in a body called the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (the FOMC) to decide the nation’s monetary policy. Together, we\ndecide how much fuel to inject into America’s $16 trillion economic engine.\n3\n\n\fJust as you and your trustees bear the fiduciary duty of properly managing and protecting the\nvalue of the pensions under your administration, we at the Fed are charged with the fiduciary\nduty of managing and protecting the value of our nation’s money supply. And just as your job is\nconditioned by decisions made by politicians outside of your control, so too is the Fed’s. Let me\nexplain.\n\nBy law we are charged by Congress with protecting the purchasing power of money from the\nravages of inflation or deflation, a directive we’ve been reasonably successful in satisfying over\nthe past 20 years or so. If we create too much money, we spur inflation; if we create too little,\ndeflation ensues. But Congress has also mandated that we conduct monetary policy so as to\nachieve full employment, a charge that we have the power to influence but cannot control. Much\nof the impetus for creating the conditions for full employment depends on how fiscal and\nregulatory actors incent job creators—where and how much to tax and spend and how businesses\nare regulated. These decisions are made by politicians the people elect, not by me and my\ncolleagues at the nation’s central bank. As long as inflation is held at bay, the Federal Reserve\ncan put the monetary pedal to the metal, but the vehicle of job creation will not move forward if\nthe fiscal and regulatory authorities have their foot firmly on the brake.\n\nYears of Extraordinary Measures\nFor six of my eight years at the Fed, we have been working to bring the nation’s economy out of\nrecession. The fiscal authorities have for the most part been AWOL during this time, having left\nthe parking brake on during their absence. This has placed the onus on the Bernanke-led Federal\nReserve. We have undertaken extraordinary measures, first to get the economy out of the\nemergency room after the financial system seizure of 2008-09, and more recently, to goose up\nthe private sector to expand payrolls. Toward this end, the Fed cut interest rates to their lowest\nlevels in the nation’s 237-year history by initially cutting the base rate for overnight interbank\nlending—the “fed funds rate”—to near zero, and then by purchasing massive amounts of U.S.\nTreasuries and bonds issued or backed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (obligations of\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac).\n\n4\n\n\fThis later program is referred to as quantitative easing, or QE, by the public and as large-scale\nasset purchases, or LSAPs, internally at the Fed. As a result of LSAPs conducted over three\nstages of QE, the Fed’s System Open Market Account now holds $2 trillion of Treasury\nsecurities and $1.3 trillion of agency and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Since last fall,\nwhen we initiated the third stage of QE, we have regularly been purchasing $45 billion a month\nof Treasuries and $40 billion a month in MBS, meanwhile reinvesting the proceeds from the\npaydowns of our mortgage-based investments. The result is that our balance sheet has ballooned\nto more than $3.5 trillion. That’s $3.5 trillion, or $11,300 for every man, woman and child\nresiding in the United States.\n\nThe theoretical mechanics behind QE are straightforward: When the Fed buys Treasuries and\nMBS, it pays for them, putting money into the economy. A key intent of this unprecedented\nprogram was to drive down interest rates to such a degree that businesses would achieve a\nfinancial comfort level that would induce them to put back to work the millions of Americans\nthat were laid off in the Great Recession. Thus far, only 76 percent of the jobs lost during 200809 have been clawed back in the more than three and a half years of modest to moderate payroll\ngains. This 76 percent figure does not include the 3 million or so jobs that would normally be\ncreated to absorb growth in the working-age population.\n\nMuscling the Yield Curve …\nThe efficacy of this effort is the subject of significant debate, even internally within the FOMC.\nSome who question the efficacy, including myself, note that the effect of our purchasing MBS\nand driving down mortgage rates has certainly assisted a robust recovery in housing, and with it,\nconstruction jobs and manufacturing and transportation of materials that go into homes. This was\nclear from reading the components of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing\nindex released last Thursday, which showed the biggest one-month jump since 1996. Very\nliberal financing terms for automobiles that we have induced have coincided with an aging of the\nnation’s auto fleet to regenerate domestic auto sales to the 15.7 million units level. And the Fed’s\nmuscling of the yield curve has brought what has been a 30-year-long bond market rally to a\ncrescendo, as shown in the right-hand bottom corner of these slides.\n\n5\n\n\f10-Year Treasury Bond Yield\n\nPercent\n16\n\nSep.

Any CEO or CFO worth their salt—\nrunning a company that is large, medium or small, whether publicly or privately owned—has by\n6\n\n\fnow taken advantage of this to restructure the liability side of their balance sheet. Publicly held\ncompanies have benefitted even more as lower rates have driven a raging bull market for stocks.\nAs equity prices break new ground daily, the S&P 500 has soared 153 percent from its March\n2009 trough.\n\nAnd yet job creation has been slow in coming. On this crucial front—the second leg of our dual\nmandate—we do not seem to have achieved much with the trillions of dollars we have poured\ninto the economy through our three QE programs.\n\n… Is Accompanied by Costs\nCounteracting whatever benefits one can trace to the Fed’s unorthodox policies are some obvious\ncosts. First, savers and others who rely on retirement monies invested in short-maturity fixedincome investments, such as bank CDs and Treasury bills, have seen their income evaporate\nwhile the rich and the quick, the big money players of Wall Street have become richer still.\n\nSecond, the standard return assumptions of 7.5 to 8 percent for retirement pools, as you well\nknow, have been dashed (though I have always felt they were already calculated on an imaginary\nand politically convenient basis rather than a realistic one).\n\nThird, accompanying the Fed’s growing balance sheet we have seen a dramatic expansion in the\nmonetary base—the sum of reserves and currency. Currently, much of the monetary base has\npiled up in the form of excess reserves of banks who have not found willing or able borrowers.\nOther forms of surplus cash are lying fallow on the balance sheets of businesses or being\ndeployed in buying back shares and increasing dividend payouts so as to buttress company stock\nprices. A basic understanding of demand-pull inflation is “too much money chasing too few\ngoods.” Thus, the excess, currently nondeployed money could prove the kindling of an\ninflationary conflagration unless the Fed is nimble in managing its effect as it works its way into\nthe economy’s production and consumption of goods and services.\n\nA corollary of reining in this massive monetary stimulus in a timely manner is that financial\nmarkets may have become too accustomed to what some have depicted as a Fed “put.” Some\nhave come to expect the Fed to keep the markets levitating indefinitely. This distorts the pricing\n7\n\n\fof financial assets, encourages lazy analysis and can set the groundwork for serious misallocation\nof capital.\n\nThe Challenge of Untying the Monetary Gordian Knot\nThe challenge now facing the FOMC is that of deciding when to begin dialing back (or as the\nfinancial press is fond of reporting: “tapering”) the amount of additional security purchases. In\nhis press conference following our June FOMC meeting, speaking on behalf of the Committee,\nChairman Bernanke made clear the parameters for dialing back and eventually ending the QE\nprogram. Should the economy continue to improve along the lines then envisioned by\nCommittee, the market could anticipate our slowing the rate of purchases later this year, with an\neye toward curtailing new purchases as the unemployment rate broaches 7 percent and prospects\nfor solid job gains remain promising.\n\nKindly note that this does not mean that the Committee would envision raising the shorter term\nfed funds rate simultaneously; indeed, the Committee has said it expects this pivotal rate to\nremain between 0 and ¼ percent at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5\npercent, intermediate prospects for inflation are reasonable, and longer-term inflationary\nexpectations remain well anchored.\n\nHaving stated this quite clearly, and with the unemployment rate having come down to 7.4\npercent, I would say that the Committee is now closer to execution mode, pondering the right\ntime to begin reducing its purchases, assuming there is no intervening reversal in economic\nmomentum in coming months.\n\nThis is a delicate moment. The Fed has created a monetary Gordian Knot. You can see the\ndeveloping complexity of that knot in this sequence of slides tracing the change in our portfolio\nstructure with each phase of QE.\n\n8\n\n\fThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\nQE1\n\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\nLong-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: Large-scale asset purchase programs, popularly known as quantitative easing (QE), began by the FOMC in\nlate 2008 when the Federal Reserve purchased long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed and agency securities.\n\nThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n9\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n\fThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nQE3\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\nOperation\ntwist\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: In the maturity-extension program, also known as “Operation Twist,” the Federal Reserve sold short-term\nsecurities while purchasing longer-term securities.\n\nThe Fed’s Gordian Knot Problem\nFed assets,\n$ billions\n\nQE2\n\nQE1\nextended\n\n3,500\n\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\nQE3\n\nQE1\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\nOperation\ntwist\n\nFed balance\nsheet on track\nto exceed\n$3.7 trillion\nbefore the\nSeptember\nFOMC meeting\n\nFinancial market\nsupport, other\nMortgage-backed\nand agency\nsecurities\nLong-term\nTreasuries\nShort-term\nTreasuries\n\nShort-term Treasuries\n\n500\n0\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nNOTE: Estimated size of the securities portfolio will exceed $3.7 trillion if net purchases continue along the same\ntrend as they have year-to-date.\n\nWhereas before, our portfolio consisted primarily of instantly tradable short-term Treasury\npaper, now we hold almost none; our portfolio consists primarily of longer-term Treasuries and\nMBS. Without delving into the various details and adjustments that could be made (such as\nconsiderations of assets readily available for purchase by the Fed), we now hold roughly 20\n10\n\n\fpercent of the stock and continue to buy more than 25 percent of the gross issuance of Treasury\nnotes and bonds. Further, we hold more than 25 percent of MBS outstanding and continue to take\ndown more than 30 percent of gross new MBS issuance. Also, our current rate of MBS purchases\nfar outpaces the net monthly supply of MBS.\n\nThe point is: We own a significant slice of these critical markets. This is, indeed, something of a\nGordian Knot.\n\nThose of you familiar with the Gordian legend know there were two versions to it: One holds\nthat Alexander the Great simply dispatched with the problem by slicing the intractable knot in\nhalf with his sword; the other posits that Alexander pulled the knot out of its pole pin, exposed\nthe two ends of the cord and proceeded to untie it. According to the myth, the oracles then\ndivined that he would go on to conquer the world.\n\nThere is no Alexander to simply slice the complex knot that we have created with our rounds of\nQE. Instead, when the right time comes, we must carefully remove the program's pole pin and\ngingerly unwind it so as not to prompt market havoc. For starters though, we need to stop\nbuilding upon the knot. For this reason, I have advocated that we socialize the idea of the\ninevitability of our dialing back and eventually ending our LSAPs. In June, I argued for the\nChairman to signal this possibility at his last press conference and at last week’s meeting\nsuggested that we should gird our loins to make our first move this fall. We shall see if that\nrecommendation obtains with the majority of the Committee.\n\nAs administrators of our states’ retirement funds, you have a vested interest in the Fed’s success.\nAfter all, the promises made to the good people who have worked for your states can only be\nkept if financial stability reigns, employment increases and economic growth improves. I believe\nwe are capable of achieving these things, despite suggestions by some that we are locked into a\nsecular trend of subpar growth; I believe that the U.S. is capable of significant economic growth\ngoing forward. But only if the nation’s fiscal authorities get their act together and develop\npolicies that complement rather than retard the good that prudent monetary policy can achieve.\nThe fiscal folks need to end the behavior parodied in this little video clip.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\n11\n\n\fOur elected officials’ traditional approach to fiscal matters has been about as cavalier as what\nyou just saw. Given their dissolute behavior, against the background of the problems that beset\nEurope, the long-standing stagnation of Japan, and the challenges that face China and the\nemerging market economies that have prospered from supplying the materials needed for\nChinese growth, I have often said that “the U.S. is the best-looking horse in the glue factory.”\nWeak as we have been, we are the best compared to all the rest. I have argued that the principal\nforce holding us back from being the absolute best economy, bar none, has been fiscal\nmanagement that seems incapable of providing job creators with tax, spending and regulatory\nincentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided so that\nbusinesses can put the American people back to work.\n\nI have argued that whatever success we have achieved in clawing our way out of the “Great\nRecession” has been despite the fiscal and regulatory authorities. Ask any businessman or\nwoman what holds him or her back and they will tell you it’s not monetary policy; it is that they\ncan’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or how government\nspending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their opinion of the\nimpact of regulation on their businesses, don’t even go there, unless you delight in hearing\nprofanities.\n\nHorseshift!\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. As I said, American companies publicly held and\nprivate—large, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money\nmade available by the Fed’s hyper-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular\nbalance sheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory\nuncertainty, they have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging\nIT, just-in-time inventory management and new production structures to the max. I believe\nAmerican businesses today are, far and away, the most efficient operators in the world. We have\ncountless businesses in every sector of goods and service production that are the equivalents of\nthe Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any great thoroughbred that has ever\ngraced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\n\n12\n\n\fThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let 'em rip, we\nwould have an economy that would soar. We would experience what, tongue firmly but\nconfidently in cheek, I would call “horseshift”: from being the stuff of an economic glue factory\nto becoming the wonder-horse that would outpace the rest of the world, putting the American\npeople back to work and renewing the wonder of American prosperity. If you and your fellow\ncitizens from whatever state you hail from insist upon it, it will be done.\nSecretariat Winning 1973 Belmont Stakes by 31 Lengths\n\n©Bob Coglianese\n\nThank you.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\n2128 Rayburn House Office Building\nJune 26, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCorrecting ‘Dodd–Frank’ to Actually End ‘Too Big to Fail’\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nTestimony before the Committee on Financial Services\nU.S. House of Representatives\nHearing on “Examining How the Dodd–Frank Act Could Result in\nMore Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts”\nJune 26, 2013\n\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee,\nthank you for the opportunity to testify at this hearing on “Examining How the\nDodd–Frank Act Could Result in More Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts.”\n\nBefore I begin, I want to recognize the common goal that we all share—ending\n“too big to fail” (TBTF) and taxpayer-funded bailouts. However, as iconic patriot\nPatrick Henry said in one of his greatest speeches, “Different men often see the\nsame subject in different lights.” I recognize and respect a difference of opinion on\nthis critical issue of how to eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts. But I trust that in\nthe marketplace of ideas and after careful deliberation—such as this hearing—our\ndemocratic process will shine through and decisions will be made that are in the\nbest interest of our country.\n\nIn the same speech, Patrick Henry also appealed to all perspectives to do right:\n“This is no time for ceremony,” he said, for it “…is one of awful moment to this\ncountry.”\n\n1\n\n\fThe great patriot was, of course, addressing the injustice of perpetuating the rule of\nthe British Crown. This morning, I want to address what I consider the injustice of\nperpetuating financial institutions that are so large, complex and opaque that they\nare seen as critical to the proper functioning of our economy and are therefore\nconsidered TBTF.\n\nI will argue that these institutions operate under a privileged status that exacts an\nunfair and nontransparent tax upon the American people and represents not only a\nthreat to financial stability, but to the rule of law as well as principles of fair and\nopen competition—hallmarks of the democratic capitalism that makes our country\ngreat.\n\nI will argue that the effort crafted by Congress to correct the problems of TBTF—\nknown as the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(Dodd–Frank)—is, despite its best intentions, ineffective, burdensome, imposes a\nprohibitive cost burden on the non-TBTF banking institutions and needs to be\namended. It is an example of the triumph of hope over experience.\n\nAnd, lastly, I will argue that dealing with TBTF is a cause that should be embraced\nby Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. For regardless of your\nideological bent, there is no escaping the reality that TBTF banks’ bad decisions\ninflicted harm upon the American people in the excessive credit boom through\n2007 and particularly during the “awful moment” of the 2008–09 crisis.1 The\nAmerican people will be grateful to whoever liberates them from the risk of a\nrecurrence of taxpayer bailouts and the serious threat of another Great Depression.\n\n2\n\n\fFederal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: As is our\npractice, I speak only for myself, not for others associated with our nation’s central\nbank. There are different views on this issue even within the Fed; like Patrick\nHenry’s co-patriots, we too “see the same subject in different lights.” In addition to\nJeff Lacker, President of the Richmond Fed, who is here with us today, the\nchairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, and three other governors, Jeremy Stein,\nDaniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell, all good friends and men I greatly admire, have\nexpressed different views than ours in Dallas about how to address the problem of\nTBTF. You should consider their views, as well as those of Mr. Hoenig and Ms.\nBair who join Mr. Lacker and me on this panel.2 Today, I’ll simply give you the\nviews that have been thought through over several years by my colleagues and me\nat the Dallas Fed.\n\nWhat’s the Problem?\nLess than a dozen megabanks—a mere 0.2 percent of all banking organizations—\ncontrol two-thirds of the assets in the U.S. banking industry. The concentration of\nassets has been ongoing for more than 30 years, but it picked up pace in the 1990s\nand greatly intensified during the 2008–09 financial crisis, when several failing\ngiants were absorbed, with taxpayers’ support, by larger, presumably healthier\nones.\n\nThe result is a lopsided financial system, and the episode we all experienced in\n2008–09 is one we are still in the process of recovering from. None of us ever wish\nto experience another catastrophe such as occurred in fall 2008. Yet, given the\nwell-intentioned but impracticable reforms forged in the crucible of the crisis, I\nbelieve the likelihood and severity of another crisis have risen rather than receded.\n\n3\n\n\fHere are the facts: Today, we have about 5,500 banking organizations in the\nUnited States. Nearly each and every one of these bank holding companies\nrepresents no threat to the survival of our economic system. But less than a dozen\nof the largest and most complex banks are each capable—through a series of\nmissteps by their management—of seriously damaging the vitality, resilience and\nprosperity that has personified the U.S. economy. Any of these megabanks, given\ntheir systemic footprint and interconnectedness with other large financial\ninstitutions, could threaten to bring down the economy, again. This 0.2 percent of\nbanks, deemed candidates to be considered “too big to fail,” is treated differently\nfrom the other 99.8 percent and differently from other businesses (Figure 1).\n\nImplicit government policy has made these megabank institutions exempt from the\nnormal processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. TBTF is a euphemism\nfor a financial institution so large, interconnected and/or complex that its functions\nare seen as critical and policymakers think its demise could substantially damage\nthe financial system and economy if it were allowed to fail. Without fear of\n4\n\n\fclosure, these banks and their counterparties can take excessive risks. We regularly\nsee this reported in the press: Megabanks are too often driven by a culture directed\nmore toward the generation of revenue growth to inflate their share price, without\nsufficient regard to prudent risk management. Executives and investors capture the\nupside; the taxpayers bear the downside risk (although this is not measured in our\nfederal budget).\n\nIn our capitalist economic system, when companies that experience difficulties fail,\ntheir business models are rationalized, streamlined and reorganized. The highly\ndiverse economic engine of growth that is the United States has become robustly\ndynamic upon the currents of what the renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter\ntermed “creative destruction”—a “reap what you sow,” free-market process of\nsuccess and failure, innovation and obsolescence. Viable business models should\nbe given the opportunity to compete and prosper on their own merits, while\nunattractive strategies should be allowed to fail. Subverting the ability to fail, on\nthe taxpayers’ dime, is a perversion of American capitalism.\n\nAdvantages to being Too Big, Too Complex, Too Opaque\nThe playing field is tilted to the advantage of the megabanks that can raise capital\nmore cheaply than their smaller competitors due to perceived taxpayer support.\nStudies, including those published by the International Monetary Fund and the\nBank for International Settlements, estimate this advantage to be as much as 1\npercentage point, or some $50 billion to $100 billion annually for U.S. TBTF\nbanks, during the period surrounding the financial crisis.3 In a popular post by\neditors at Bloomberg, the 10 largest U.S. banks are estimated to enjoy an aggregate\nlonger-term subsidy of $83 billion per year.4\n\n5\n\n\fAndy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England,\nestimates the current implicit TBTF subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for\nthe 29 global institutions identified as “systemically important.”5\n\nLarge banks and their allies have pushed back against these points, producing a\nflurry of counter-claims in recent months. My staff and I have reviewed these\narguments and have found them to be assertions lacking merit.\n\nGiven this range of estimates, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of\nLouisiana have asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to calculate\njust how much of a cost-of-funds advantage the big banks have over the mid-sized\nand smaller community banking organizations that make up the 99.8 percent that\nare not implicitly protected from failure.\n\nAs pointed out by Simon Johnson, the MIT economist and former chief economist\nat the International Monetary Fund, all one has to do is ask people in the credit\nmarkets if they think lenders to the biggest banks have some degree of protection\noffered by the government, and you will hear a resounding “yes.”6\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that whatever the precise subsidy number is, it exists,\nit is significant and it encourages the biggest banking organizations, along with\ntheir many nonbank subsidiaries (investment firms, securities lenders, finance\ncompanies), to grow larger and riskier.\n\nThis entire arrangement is patently unfair. It makes for an uneven playing field,\ntilted to the advantage of Wall Street against Main Street, placing the financial\nsystem and the economy in constant jeopardy.\n6\n\n\fThe Problem Magnified, Not Solved\nThe Dodd–Frank Act was a well-intentioned response to the problem. We respect\nits drafters and those who crafted it in an earnest attempt to address much needed\nreform in the financial services industry. However, its stated promise to end too big\nto fail rings hollow. Running 849 pages and with more than 9,000 pages of\nregulations written so far to implement it, Dodd–Frank is long on process and\ncomplexity but short on results. Consequently, nearly three years after Dodd–\nFrank was signed into law, very little positive reform has been implemented.\n\nRegulators cannot enforce rules that are not easily understood. Nor can they\nenforce these rules without creating armies of new supervisors. This venerable\nCommittee on Financial Services aggregates information from the Federal Register\nthat estimates the cumulative hours needed for the affected agencies, like the Fed,\nto fulfill new requirements called for by Dodd–Frank. This Committee presently\nestimates that it will take 24,180,856 hours each year to comply with new rules\nalready finalized for implementation of the act.7 And we have yet to complete the\nrulemaking process!\n\nI work every day with my colleagues at the Fed to craft the monetary conditions to\nhelp the economy create jobs. This is not the kind of job creation I would hope for.\n\nI doubt anyone seriously believes that an additional several thousand pages of\nregulations, on top of the nine thousand already written, will provide clarity,\nprocedural focus and the proper incentives to end TBTF and to “Just Say No” to\nmore government bailouts.\n\n7\n\n\fComplex regulations create barriers to entry and encourage firms to morph into\neven more complex and opaque structures. Further, regulatory supervision, by\ndefinition, is always at least one step behind the actions taken by market\nparticipants. The more complex the rules, the more difficult it is to bridge the gap\ndue to the complexities of financial markets. None of this is helpful for financial\nstability.\n\nBailout Concerns Linger\nBriefly, I believe the current legislative solution to ending TBTF has actually\nexacerbated the issue and potentially codified TBTF, rather than eliminated it.\n\nAs soon as a financial institution is designated “systemically important” as\nrequired under Title I of Dodd–Frank (and becomes known by the acronym\n“SIFI”), it is viewed by the market as being the first to be saved by the first\nresponders in a financial crisis. In other words, these “SIFIs” occupy a privileged\nspace in the financial system (one pundit referred to the acronym as meaning “Save\nIf Failure Impending”). As a corollary, a banking customer has a disincentive to do\nbusiness with smaller competitors, because a non-SIFI does not have an implied\ngovernment funding lifeline. Even if a SIFI ends up funding itself with more equity\ncapital than a smaller competitor, the choice remains for where you would like to\nhold important financial relationships: with an institution with a government\nbackstop or one without? Thus, the playing field remains uneven; the advantages\nof size and perceived subsidy accrue to the behemoth banks that will continue to\ngrow larger and become even more of a systemic risk. Dodd–Frank does not\neliminate this perception and in many ways perpetuates it as reality.\nFurther, some have held out hope that a key provision of Title I requiring banking\norganizations to submit detailed plans for their orderly resolution in bankruptcy,\n8\n\n\fwithout government assistance, will provide for a roadmap to avoid bailouts.\nHowever, these “living wills” are likely to prove futile in helping navigate a realtime “systemic” failure. Given the complexity and opacity of the TBTF institutions\nand the ability to move assets and liabilities across subsidiaries and affiliates (as\nwell as off-balance sheet, including through huge and fast-moving derivative\npositions), a living will would likely be ineffective when it really mattered. I do not\nhave much faith in the living will process to make any material difference in TBTF\nrisks and behaviors—a bank would run out of liquidity (not capital) due to\nreputational risk quicker than management would work with regulators to execute\na living will blueprint.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Title II of Dodd–Frank describes and designates the\nOrderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as the resolution mechanism to handle the\ndisposal of a giant, systemically-disruptive financial enterprise. The three letters\nthemselves evoke the deceptive doublespeak of an Orwellian nightmare. The “L,”\nwhich stands for liquidation, will in practice become a simulated restructuring, as\nwould occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nIn reality, rather than fulfill Dodd–Frank’s promise of “no more taxpayer-funded\nbailouts,” the U.S. Treasury will likely provide, through the FDIC, debtor-inpossession financing to the failed companies’ artificially-kept-alive operating\nsubsidiaries for up to five years, but perhaps longer. Under the single point of entry\nmethod, the operating subsidiaries remain protected as the holding company is\nrestructured. So if a company does business with the operating subsidiaries, say,\nthrough derivatives transactions, then this company is even more confident that\ntheir counterparty is TBTF. Some officials refer to this procedure as a “liquidity\n\n9\n\n\fprovision” rather than a bailout. Call it whatever you wish, but this is taxpayer\nfunding at far-below-market rates.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we would call this form of “liquidation” a nationalized financial\ninstitution. During the five-year resolution period, this nationalized institution does\nnot have to pay any taxes of any kind to any government entity. To us, this looks,\nsounds, and tastes like a taxpayer bailout, just hidden behind different language. If\nit waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\n\nMoreover, if the reorganized company cannot repay the Treasury for its debtor-inpossession financing, Title II suggests that the repayment should be clawed back\nvia a special assessment on the company’s SIFI competitors. But that assessment is\nthen written off as a tax-deductible business expense, thereby reducing revenue to\nthe Treasury. This is a \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" chain of events, with the taxpayer\nplaying the role of Peter. Although I have not seen the Congressional Budget\nOffice run the numbers for the plausible scenarios, I suspect that the impact on our\nfederal deficit and debt would be significant, not to mention the potential effects\nfrom the concomitant recession that would likely occur. This does not sound like a\n“no taxpayer-funded bailouts” solution. One form of explicit intervention appears\nto have been replaced by Title II of Dodd–Frank, a disguised form of taxpayer\nbailout.\n\nTitle II promotes and sustains an unnatural longevity for zombie financial\ninstitutions—and this is an acute issue in other financial systems, including parts of\nEurope today. Title II imposes a competitive disadvantage onto small- and\nmedium-size financial institutions, and it does so for potentially several years at\ntaxpayer expense. It is these smaller financial institutions that, by the way, provide\n10\n\n\fthe primary financial lifeline so vital to the small- and medium-size businesses in\nyour Congressional districts that, in turn, provide the bulk of innovation and job\ncreation in the United States.8\n\nThis Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on\nMay 15, 2013, in this very room that focused on Title II in great detail. The four\nwitnesses who testified that day gave a very informative and expert critique of the\nshortcomings of Title II, and I respectfully refer you to that hearing.9\n\nA Simple Proposal\nWhere does the current reform effort leave us and how should we forge a path\nforward? Despite the plethora of new rules and regulations created by Dodd–\nFrank, market discipline is still lacking for the largest financial institutions, as it\nwas during the last crisis. Why should a prospective purchaser of bank debt or\nother type of counterparty practice due diligence if, in the end, regardless of new\nlayers of regulation and oversight, it is widely perceived that the issuing institution\nand its subsidiaries will not be allowed to fail? There is a great deal of moral\nhazard at all levels of decision-making in our current financial system. We must\nchange this status quo.\n\nThe return of marketplace discipline and effective due diligence of banking\nbehemoths is long overdue. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed offer a modest\nproposal to that end, with a goal of leveling the playing field for all.\n\nHere is a simple graphic of the basic organizational structure of a typical financial\nholding company (Figure 2). Note that the highlighted commercial bank operation\nwithin that structure. To begin with, we would roll back the federal safety net—\n11\n\n\fdeposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window—to where it was\nalways intended to be, that is, to traditional commercial bank deposit and lending\nintermediation and payment system functions.10 Thus, the safety net would only be\navailable to traditional commercial banks and not to the nonbank affiliates of bank\nholding companies or the parent companies themselves. This is how the law needs\nto be applied, even in times of crisis.11\n\nSecond, customers, creditors and counterparties of all nonbank affiliates and the\nparent holding companies would sign a simple, legally binding, unambiguous\ndisclosure acknowledging and accepting that there is no government guarantee—\never—backstopping their investment (Figure 3). They are on their own, and they\nknow it. A similar disclaimer would apply to banks’ deposits outside the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection limit and other unsecured debts.\n\n12\n\n\fKnowing where the federal government guarantees begin and end would properly\nrealign incentives and reinvigorate a degree of creditor discipline that has been\ndormant at large, complex financial institutions for far too long.\n\nThird, we recommend that the largest financial holding companies be restructured\nso that every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy\nprocess, and in the case of the banking entities themselves, that they become an\nappropriate size, complexity and geographic footprint that is “too small to save.”12\nAddressing institutional size is vital to maintaining a credible threat of failure,\nthereby providing a convincing case that policy has truly changed. This step gets\nboth bank incentives and structure right, neither of which is accomplished by\nDodd–Frank.\n\nOur third step would provide a more level playing field with reduced regulatory\ncosts for all competitors, encourage greater innovation by all members of the\n13\n\n\fbanking industry and minimize the downside consequences to the economy of\nmegabank failures. The downsized, formerly too-big-to-fail banks would then be\nsmall and simple enough (just like the other 99.8 percent) that, with adequate\nplanning, the FDIC could close and then reopen the bank in short order with new\nmanagement and new private-sector ownership. “Closed on Friday and reopened\non Monday” is the customary process administered by the FDIC that we would like\nto see applicable for all depository financial institutions.\n\nNo bank would remain so significant and interconnected to the financial system\nthat its demise would spell the unraveling of the financial system. In these new\ncircumstances, all banks that warranted closure would fail the old fashioned way;\nthey would be gone, with their stockholders’ equity written down to zero, their\nbondholders saddled with haircuts and their insured depositors left unharmed.\n\nWhat’s The Way Forward?\nThe aim of our three-step proposal is simple: All banks would be subject to\nregulatory oversight that fits its business model—and most important, all banks\nwould be subject to the market discipline exercised by owners and creditors. Given\nthis more explicit treatment of creditors of regulated commercial banks, creditors\nof unregulated shadow banks should begin to understand that government\nguarantees don’t apply to their transactions with the affiliates of regulated\ncommercial banks nor with unregulated financial companies that offer similar\nproducts and services. Market discipline could then begin to reinforce and even\nsomewhat replace regulatory discipline.\n\nSome argue that these three steps are already at work within the current regulatory\nand legal framework. Others cautiously warn that we should wait to see how all of\n14\n\n\fthe rules and regulations of Dodd–Frank are implemented before we attempt any\nimprovements. Both perspectives might underappreciate the urgency we feel to\ncorrect the current imbalance and perversion of capitalism before the next crisis,\nnot after.\n\nArguments to “give Dodd–Frank a chance” or to simply address TBTF with higher\ncapital requirements (and not complementary structural changes) fall short of\nnecessary action. Living wills and higher capital requirements are potentially very\nhelpful tools but are not sufficient to ensure the survival of a company, and they\nwill not eliminate massive losses that can choke off liquidity and disrupt financial\nmarkets and the economy.\n\nBanks are levered institutions and are vulnerable given that they are usually\nlevered with short-term debt like deposits and repo-like funding vehicles. Thus,\ncapital helps to maintain confidence that the institution can sustain some losses and\nstill remain open for business tomorrow. But once investors and creditors begin to\nfear that losses have been understated or forthcoming at that institution or similar\ninstitutions, confidence begins to rapidly diminish, and almost no amount of capital\nis sufficient to forestall a collapse of confidence and a liquidity crisis. When\nconfidence begins to wane, liquidity dries up quickly. And the plunge in\nconfidence is contagious, often having little to do with the underlying situation of\neach company. That’s where the lender of last resort function of the Federal\nReserve comes into play—the central bank lends to solvent companies, those with\npositive capital and good collateral. But such capital is only a small element in\nsaving a company from extinction. Confidence matters even more.\n\n15\n\n\fWithin the category of capital, it is loss-absorbing capital that buttresses\nconfidence the most. Equity capital is the first to absorb losses; hence, it is the\nmost expensive capital to raise. Debt doesn’t absorb losses except in bankruptcy, at\nwhich point the company is dead. Risk-weighted capital is somewhat\nmeaningless—and sometimes deeply misleading—in the context of loss\nabsorbency; any asset that incurs losses must be written off against equity capital,\nwhether the loss was in business loans, mortgage loans, municipal bonds or agency\ndebt. If losses thin out the capital cushion to the point of undermining confidence,\nthe future viability of the company slips. Nobody knows the magic capital ratio\nthat will prevent a loss of confidence, and I do not believe regulators will suddenly\nbecome better equipped to set higher magical ratios in the future for the largest,\nmost politically-connected banking institutions. Capital is necessary for viability\n(nonfailure), and I support higher capital requirements (particularly for any\ninstitution that could become of systemic importance), but it is not sufficient.\n\nWe concede that our proposal doesn’t have all the answers either. It would not\neliminate financial crises—that would be an impossible or even foolish goal—but\nit should reduce their frequency and severity. Nor will it alter the human DNA of\nthose who serve as “first responders” during the next crisis. Our proposal should\nmake the magnitude of the problems regulators face, and the tasks they need to\nperform, far more manageable. Under our plan, supervisory agencies would\noversee several thousand community banks, a few hundred moderate-size banks\n(by today’s standards) and no megabanks. The nonbank and shadow bank\ncomponents of a large financial holding company would still operate but without\nsubsidy and access to the safety net and with long-overdue market discipline\nimposed by at-risk creditors.\n\n16\n\n\fThere will always be some banks that are larger than the rest, and consequently,\nthere will be temptation for regulators to label the “biggest few” as systemically\nimportant. The fluctuating nature of human resolve and political fortitude, as well\nas the problem of “regulatory capture,” has been present in U.S. bank policy at\nleast since the intervention/bailout of Continental Illinois and its creditors in 1984.\nOur proposal may not prohibit regulators from intervening to support the\nunsecured creditors of a failing banking institution. But our proposal reduces the\ndimensions of the problem—asset size and systemic interconnectedness—by an\norder of magnitude and thereby should diminish the tendency to intervene out of\nfear of unknown systemic risks. Our plan would dramatically reduce the costs of\nnonintervention.\n\nThe elimination of TBTF along the lines we have proposed will not, as the\nmegabanks suggest, diminish our nation’s competitive advantage in global\nfinancial markets. If anything, our proposal may help drive innovation in our\nfinancial system by leveling the playing field.\n\nThe former safety net implicitly covered too much of a selective part of the credit\nintermediation system, promoting perverse risk-taking incentives. We believe that\nhad the Dallas Fed plan I have articulated today been in place a decade ago, it\nwould have altered the insidious behaviors that contributed to the crisis, avoiding\nthe bailouts and their aftermath, the cost of which our nation’s citizens will endure\nfor years to come.13 We believe that had our plan helped guide the restructuring of\nthe banking and financial services industry before the crisis began, neither\nCitigroup, Bank of America, nor others would have been positioned to receive\nhundreds of billions of dollars of extraordinary government assistance; the parts of\nthese companies that got into trouble would have been sold off, closed or run\n17\n\n\fthrough a standard bankruptcy process. The taxpayers would never have been\ninvolved.\n\nThe same could be said of Bear Stearns; the first shadow bank to require\ngovernment assistance back in March 2008 would have been governed by market\ndiscipline and unable to call upon giant banking institutions to find an over-theweekend, government-assisted acquisition because there would have been no\nmegabanks to invite to the table. Further, the more disciplined financial\nmarketplace that would result from the adoption of our proposal likely would have\nhelped prevent a concentration of risks and imbalances of the magnitude that\noccurred at AIG. This is the ultimate test and counterfactual thought experiment\nfor any proposal to end TBTF. The GAO and others estimate that the cost of the\nfinancial crisis, measured in lost consumption and jobs, could exceed $14 trillion,\nor roughly one whole year of U.S. output.14\n\nWe do not think Dodd–Frank would have averted the 2008–09 financial crisis and\nits horrendous costs and consequences had the act been in place and implemented\nin the years before the crisis began. Were we to have another crisis today, we\nbelieve that the cost would be even greater because, in effect, rather than in theory,\nDodd–Frank entrenches and perpetuates TBTF banks that are now even bigger\nthan they were before.\n\nAn Appeal for Action\nIn my introduction, I referred to Patrick Henry. In the speech I quoted, he went on\nto say, “It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut\nour eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” I implore the members of this important committee and the\n18\n\n\fCongress to not succumb merely to the illusion of hope. Don’t listen to the siren\nsong of the megabanks and their lobbyists. Take action to deal with the unfair\nadvantages that these institutions enjoy. They will spend millions of dollars to try\nto perpetuate their brand of crony capitalism. Resisting their entreaties is the right\nthing to do. Leveling the playing field is a just cause for 99.8 percent of American\nbanks and for all Americans.\n\nThe potential taxpayer burden of dealing with TBTF institutions might be\naddressed by a still-growing army of bank supervisory personnel trying to enforce\nthe rigid, complex and probably easy-to-evade rules of Dodd–Frank. However, this\nwould be oversight without the benefit of supplemental reinforcement from market\ndiscipline and increased due diligence.\n\nIn March of this year, the Dallas Fed released an annual report on “Vanquishing\nToo Big to Fail.” 15 The contents of this report explored the merits of community\nbanks, the adverse effects of current reform efforts and the urgency of reasserting\nmarket discipline for all institutions—large and small—to compete on a more level\nplaying field. Accompanying these essays is a series of responses to the questions\nand criticisms we have received about our proposal, including those raised by\nproponents for the megabanks. This “Q&A with Richard Fisher on TBTF” can be\nfound at www.dallasfed.org/microsites/fed/annual/2012/ar12c/index.cfm.\n\nUnfortunately, a subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nOvercoming entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer inertia,\nmay require government-sanctioned reorganization and restructuring of the TBTF\nfirms in order to accelerate the imposition of effective market discipline.\n\n19\n\n\fWe advocate using as little government intervention and statutory modification as\npossible to restructure the largest institutions to a size that is effectively disciplined\nby both market and regulatory forces—so that every corporate entity is subject to a\nspeedy bankruptcy process and every banking entity is “too small to save.”\nThis would underscore to customers and creditors that a credible regime shift has\ntaken place, that all banking organizations are without subsidy and are governed by\nthe market discipline of creditors at risk of loss, and that the reign of TBTF\npolicies has truly ended.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nThe recent recession began in 2007 but cascaded into crisis in fall 2008, the effects of which we still grapple\nwith today.\n2\nSome examples of other thoughts on ending TBTF within the Federal Reserve System, include “Regulating\nLarge Financial Institutions,” speech by Jeremy C.

Sockin, Empirical & Thematic Perspectives, Citi Research, Dec. 10, 2012. These international\neconomists noted that “well-established results in the empirical literature have shown a special link between\nsmall firms and small banks. As such, this sustained and sizable decline in the role of small banks as providers\nof credit—reflecting the ongoing consolidation of the U.S. banking system—is very likely a factor contributing\nto the downtrend in the share of credit provided to small firms.” Further, the authors conclude that they\n“would be inclined to support public policies designed to ensure a level playing field between firms of various\nsizes and, in addition, measures to incentivize small-business creation and the allocation of credit to young\nfirms.” We at the Dallas Fed agree with this conclusion and promote competition across industries, including\nfinancial services.\n9\nHearing entitled “Who Is Too Big to Fail: Does Title II of the Dodd–Frank Act Enshrine Taxpayer-Funded\nBailouts?” Testimony by Professor David A.

Taylor, Mr. Joshua Rosner and Mr.\nMichael Krimminger, May 15, 2013,\nwww.financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=333122.\n10\nThe Fed’s discount window offers three secured lending programs to depository institutions: primary credit,\nsecondary credit and seasonal credit. Primary credit is a very short-term (usually overnight) loan to depository\ninstitutions in generally sound financial condition. Depository institutions not eligible for primary credit may\napply for secondary credit to meet short-term liquidity needs. Seasonal credit is extended to relatively small\ndepository institutions that have recurring intrayear fluctuations in funding needs.\n11\nThis would not prevent the Federal Reserve from serving its lender of last resort function in a liquidity crisis\nby lending to solvent companies with good collateral at a penalty interest rate on a temporary basis.\n12\nThis restructuring would be designed and implemented by the companies’ top management team within the\ntimeframe established by legislation and/or regulation.\n13\nRichard W.

Fisher\nThank you, Hugh (MacKinnon). I am honored to speak to this annual directors’ dinner of the\nC.D. Howe Institute and on the second day of Stephen Poloz becoming the governor of the Bank\nof Canada. Evan Siddall, his special adviser, is here tonight to keep an eye on me!\nThank You, Canada\nBefore getting to my formal remarks, I want to say something about Canada that has nothing to\ndo with monetary policy. On Sept. 11, 2001, I was on a flight, returning from the celebration of\nthe opening of the Jewish Museum in Berlin two days earlier.\nOn the morning of that fateful day, my flight was en route to New York City when we were\nsuddenly redirected to Toronto. We had been prevented from landing in New York, the pilot\nannounced, because of “severe headwinds.” We were told nothing more. After landing and\ndeplaning at Pearson and going through an extensive screening process, we were ushered into a\nbriefing room and only then learned what little was known at the time of the horrors that had\noccurred. Your government and our consular officials said that we were to remain in Toronto\nuntil order in America was restored, adding they were confident we would be well cared for as\nguests of a very compassionate Canada.\nSure enough, when we exited the airport, we found a line of cars driven by private citizens who\nhad spontaneously come to the airport to take any and all of their American brethren into their\nhomes and care for us while we waited anxiously to learn more of what had happened and why.\nFrom the home of my Canadian host, I somehow managed to get through by cell phone routed\nthrough Dallas to my wife, Nancy. She was hiding with our two youngest children in the\nbasement of our house in Washington, D.C. With the passage of time, it is easy to forget how\nchaotic and frightful that day was. It was unclear if all of Washington was under attack; rumors\nabounded that the Capitol and the White House were targeted. Our son had seen the images from\nFlight 77’s crash into the Pentagon and had run home from school with his frightened little sister\nin tow.\nI wanted to make sure my wife and children were safe. She reported they were and then asked if\nI was. I remember saying, “I am safe in the hands of our Canadian brothers and sisters.”\n\n1\n\n\fEvery chance I get, I thank Canadians for the caring and unconditional friendship you and your\ncountrymen showed the United States on that infamous day. For the rest of my life, Canada will\nhold a special place in my heart.\nIndeed, I love this country so much that I have even found it possible to forgive Sheila Copps for\nforcing me to listen to endless re-loops of songs by Gordon Lightfoot when I was deputy U.S.\ntrade rep and negotiated with her during her reign as minister of Canadian heritage!1\nThe Predicament of the U.S. Economy: Growth …\nNow, on to the status of the U.S. economy and monetary policy—of special interest to you\nbecause we account for three-quarters of Canada’s goods exports and a substantial amount of\nCanadian direct and portfolio investment.\nHere is a handy graphic we use at the Dallas Fed as a simple indicator of the current predicament\nof the U.S. economy:\n\nU.S. Economic Dashboard\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n1\n\n8\n\n5.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.5\n\n4 Unemployment 10\nrate\n5.5\n\n6 6.5 7\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n8\n8.5\n\n4\n\n9\n\n3\n\nJunk-bond\nspread\n\n4.5\n\n1.78\n\n9.5\n\n-2.5\n\nPercent of jobs recovered\n7 0 . 4\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n1.29\n\n-0.5\n-1\n\nTrimmed Mean\nPCE Inflation\n\n5.5\n6\n\n4.5\n5\n\nWarning lights\nEngine Unemp.

The unemployment rate gauge is not red\nbecause it declined to 7.5 percent in April. As indicated by the odometer box, we have traveled\nsome distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the job creation we might have\nhoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent recession have been\nrecovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago.\nThe warning light for the yield curve should be pink, if not yet red, for, if anything, it is robust to\nthe point of possibly becoming problematic in giving rise to speculative impulses. Despite the\nmost recent widening, junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent, as shown; nominal yields for even\nthe lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to below 7\npercent from double digits only a year ago. This is of interest because, according to Dealogic, we\nhave had $187 billion of junk bonds issued in the U.S. so far this year, a record.2 Further,\ncovenant-light lending is on a tear. And unless you’ve been living on another planet, you know\nwe have experienced a roaring bull market for equities. Thus the “oil lamp,” shown in the lower\nleft corner of the dashboard, depicts that the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine\nof job creation.\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1\npercent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the\nfraternity of U.S. professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed:\nForecasts made at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset\nof this year, the median projection of professional forecasters called for 2.4 percent GDP growth\nfor all of 2013, and that, too, has been challenged by first-quarter data that came in below\nexpectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over again.”\nHowever, the April jobs report, revisions of previous jobs data, and reports concerning consumer\nbehavior in May have put some spring back in economists’ steps despite the malaise in\nmanufacturing that has persisted for some time (long before yesterday’s Institute for Supply\nManagement manufacturing numbers were released). Initial claims for unemployment insurance\nare now back on a downward trend, retreating toward prerecession levels, and recent retail sales\nnumbers and indicators of consumer activity have surprised to the upside. This would appear to\nindicate that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in payroll taxes,\nand are relishing the benefits of lower gasoline, food and other prices. So the recovery presently\nappears to be strong enough to propel hopes that consumption will help employment growth\ngradually improve over the long term.\nI know audiences like this always want to be given some forecast of economic growth, especially\nby someone who they assume has some inside knowledge. I’ll stick my neck out in a moment,\nafter a brief discourse on where we are on the inflation front. But I ask that you treat any forecast\nfrom any source with what I like to call “Arrow’s Caveat.”\n3\n\n\fDuring World War II, future Nobel laureate Ken Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army\nAir Corps. He and his team were charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being\na disciplined analyst, Arrow reviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed\nstatistically that the corps’ forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked\nto be relieved of this futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was\npriceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he\nneeds them for planning purposes.”\n… and the Outlook for Price Stability\nThe Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today, inflation is\nbenign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, a high rate of underemployment, labor\ncompensation rising at less than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and\nexpanding energy resources, and near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there is\nlittle likelihood of cost–push pressures in 2013. Slower growth around the globe is putting the\ndamper on demand–pull inflation. Provided the public remains confident in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability, anchored by the stated 2 percent long-term target of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), the chances of inflation rearing its ugly head in 2013 are\npresently extremely low. I am sticking my neck out for the next six months!\nIndeed, the latest Trimmed Mean PCE inflation calculation done by the Dallas Fed for April\nposted a negative reading—minus 0.1 percent—for the first time since the raw data became\navailable in 1977, with 44 percent of the basket of 178 components measured declining in price.3\nThis is all subject to revision, but the drift is that the underlying inflation rate as we see it at the\nDallas Fed, as mentioned, is running at a pace of 1.3 percent.\nThe Efficacy of Current Monetary Policy\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue of the\nmoment is not a meaningful threat to price stability. The issue is job creation. And the questions\nI keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our limited ability to affect it with our überaccommodative monetary policy.\nWith the Arrow Caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the\npresent GDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be\nunderestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence,\ncontributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer survey indicates\nthat commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious.\nThe snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector\nhave made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in\nmy home power-state of Texas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and\nno longer appear to be a major drag on growth. New technologies are providing for cheaper and\n4\n\n\fmore abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming, an important component that represents\n71 percent of the U.S. economy (compared with Canadian consumption accounting for 54\npercent of national output). Monetary policy has helped drive interest rates to historic lows and\nequity markets to historic highs; if anything, as noted, it may be giving rise to excessive\nspeculation and risk taking. In addition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant\nlending, margin debt is climbing rapidly.\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the\ncurrent dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable\nbrake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC:\n“…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”4\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\nAs this is an after-dinner speech and a little levity is always helpful in making a point at this time\nof night, here is my favorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers in\nWashington, D.C.:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to\nspend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They\njust didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison over two centuries ago: “We are ruined,\nSir, if we do not overrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’\n[and] ‘that a public debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’”5 The good news is that, some 200plus years later, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein\nin Congress’ spendthrift ways, and there have been improvements that have brightened the shortterm outlook for the level of federal debt.6 But, as yet, there has been little more than passive\naction.\nUntil the Congress and the president provide a clear road map to restoring fiscal rectitude,\neconomic growth will continue to be impeded by undue uncertainty about future tax rates, future\ngovernment purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of factors that prevent the U.S.\nfrom achieving its long-run potential. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty posturing of\nthose who must determine the fiscal path of the nation are further undermining confidence,\nhindering the upward momentum needed for a full recovery and limiting the effectiveness of\nmonetary policy.\nHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail,\nexpansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those\npurchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates, or the broadest tax of all, higher\n5\n\n\finflation. If you are an operating business, you have to discount this risk before adding\nsignificantly to payrolls and before undertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to\nconsider how the opposite approach of cutting government expenditures might impact your top\nline if the cuts are in areas that affect the markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous\nuncertainty about how health care reform will impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact\nthat community bankers—providers of the lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the\nimpetus for new job creation and economic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome\nregulations and fees imposed in response to the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If\nyou consider the economy from this perspective, you can see where brakes of the government’s\nown making are being applied, impeding the realization of our growth potential.\nDecision-making under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses; decisionmaking in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of\nhyperaccommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining\ninfluence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the\nbalance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment, despite having\npulled out all the stops on the monetary front, unless our fiscal authorities get their act together.\nThose economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls and put the American people\nback to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and regulation makers—the\nlegislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending habits and the regulatory\nregime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made available to invest in jobcreating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then, I argue that the Fed is, at\nbest, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for speculation and, eventually, a\nmassive shipboard fire of inflation.\nI note that in his speech of last Wednesday to the Economic Club of New York, former Fed\nChairman Paul Volcker highlighted that managing the supply of money and liquidity “to\naccommodate misguided fiscal policies, to deal with structural imbalances, [or] to square\ncontinuously the hypothetical circles of stability, growth and full employment” was a risky\nproposition for the Federal Reserve and warned that in attempting to do so, the Fed “will\ninevitably fall short.” He even referenced “pushing on a string.” And he added that, “The risks of\nencouraging speculative distortions and the inflationary potential—[note the word “potential,”\nnot “present instance”]—of the current approach plainly deserve attention.” I am in complete\nagreement with Mr. Volcker. I urge you to read his speech if you wish to understand my personal\nconcerns about the present course of monetary policy.7\n\n6\n\n\fA Shakespearean Scenario\nOnly time will reveal the efficacy of current policy and whether the risks that I and more\nexperienced observers like Paul Volcker fret over are as substantial as we surmise, or whether we\nhave made much ado about nothing.\nIf the Fed’s monetary policy were the stuff of Shakespearean drama with a prototypical five acts,\none might say we are in the last scene of the third act of a play titled “The Grand Experiment in\nModern Monetarism.” We will not know until the next two acts whether the play will end\nfelicitously or otherwise.\nHere is the CliffsNotes summary of the play thus far: The play opened with the great financial\ntempest of 2008–09, during which it appeared the ship of the mighty American economy would\nfounder. A humble, once unassuming but suddenly daring captain named Ben Bernanke took\nfirm control of the nation’s monetary helm in Act II, contriving innovative ways to keep the\neconomy afloat by jury-rigging monetary policy and adopting radical maneuvers. These efforts\nsucceeded in steering the ship of the economy away from the shoals of depression and deflation\nand into more tranquil waters.8\nAct III began with a recovering economy heading on a more promising course. But the headway\nbeing made was substandard, hindered by the flotsam and jetsam of fiscal incompetence and\nrising fears of a new storm brewing in Europe. In an effort to propel the economy forward at a\nbetter clip, the FOMC commanded that unprecedented amounts of monetary fuel be provisioned\nfor the financial system through large-scale asset purchases, colloquially known as QE2 and 3.\nThese purchases pumped almost $1 trillion into the stores of reserves of banks. As yet, however,\nthe banks have for the most part not shoveled that fuel into their boilers, lending only a small\nfraction of it to job-creating businesses and hoarding the remainder. Other members of the\nfinancial fleet, however, have been heartened by the turn of events, especially those who finance\nthemselves through the issuance of stocks and bonds rather than through bank loans. Yet they,\ntoo, have been reluctant to transform their renewed means into robust job creation. Thus, the\neconomy remains weaker than desired, and the ship of the economy is making less-than-desired\nheadway.\nThe plot now thickens. Act IV, just beginning, will involve the drama of introspection, with the\nFOMC evaluating the utility of its navigational tactics, and, perhaps, fine-tuning them, if not\naltering the course.\nNot until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome of arriving\nat the desired port of an economy that grows sufficiently to bring about full employment without\ngiving rise to inflation. With Shakespeare, the most pleasant plays typically end in marriage. The\nhappy outcome to our economic predicament would entail a coupling of sensible fiscal policy\n\n7\n\n\fwith prudent monetary policy, carrying the American economy to new horizons, allowing the\nFed to emerge a hero.\nOne can envision less-pleasant outcomes, however, some of them tragic. If the fiscal\nauthorities—Congress and the president—are unable to provide tax, spending and regulatory\nincentives for job creators to use the cheap and abundant capital the FOMC has made available,\nthe economy might remain endlessly becalmed. Should the FOMC try to compensate for fiscal\nauthorities’ inability to act by provisioning still more monetary fuel, it may risk an explosion of\nspeculative excess, or worse: an eventual inflationary conflagration, the debasement of money\nand the ruination of our economy and lifestyle. Should this prove the outcome, the Fed will be\ntransmogrified from hero to villain.\nTo thicken the plot further, there is the uncertainty about whether command of the Fed will\nchange hands during Act IV or V—whether the skipper who set us on the present course will\nstay (which I have personally advocated in other speeches) or be replaced by someone who\nwishes to remain on the course he set or change it. And whether in commissioning a new captain\nof the Fed’s fleet, if that is what the playwright decides, the Congress will introduce new\ndramatic themes that might steer the plot in new directions. Even now, the chorus is chanting\nabout a Sound Dollar Act and other initiatives from behind the curtain.\nAll of which means that despite the mighty efforts of Captain Bernanke and his crew, present\ncompany included, we do not know how this play will end. Will “The Grand Experiment” prove\nan inspiring history, a tragedy or simply a comedy of errors? We will not know for some time.\nWe will not know until the curtain drops on Act V.\nI am tempted to end with a slightly adapted, trite reminder that “All the world’s economy is a\nstage and we policymakers are merely players upon it,” but I shan’t. Instead I’ll end by thanking\nyou for listening to me and, again, expressing my gratitude for the solidarity you and your fellow\nCanadians have shown the United States through thick and thin.\nAnd now, Hugh, time and patience permitting, I would be happy to avoid answering any\nquestions you and your colleagues might have.\n\n8\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nAs deputy U.S. trade representative, I was dispatched to Ottawa by President Clinton to negotiate away the\nlegislation Minister Copps was proposing that would make it a criminal offense for U.S. companies to advertise in\nCanadian magazines, a clear violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n2\nSee “Bond Investors Break Pattern, Dump ‘Junk,’” by Katy Burne, Wall Street Journal, May 31, 2013.\n3\nFor the latest reading of the Dallas Fed’s alternative measure of core inflation, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n4\nThe latest statement by the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors on the stance of monetary\npolicy can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130501a.htm.\n5\nSee Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, by Jon Meacham, New York: Random House, 2012, p. 251.\n6\nSee “Our Debt Problems Are Still Far from Solved,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May 15, 2013.\n7\nSee “Central Banking at a Crossroad,” speech by Paul A.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMay 26, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f“Never Let Your Brains Go to Your Head”\n(With Reference to “Babe” Fisher)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Kim MaGee (Interim Head of School). I am grateful to be your Commencement\nspeaker this afternoon.\nBefore I begin my formal remarks, I want the Class of 2013 to look around this auditorium. All\nof these people have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents,\ncousins, uncles and aunts, your brothers and sisters, your friends, your teachers and coaches and\ncounselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They\nhave encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and\nhectored you and … driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy\nhearts to celebrate your admission to the society of educated men and women. You will be\napplauded by them many times tonight. But I want you, the graduating class, to turn the table on\nthem and give them a round of applause. So stand up, put your hands together and give them a\ncheer. Thank them for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nThe only thing that rests between you and your finally receiving your Episcopal School of Dallas\ndiploma is … me. So I will make it snappy.\nBy now, you have taken enough English and writing courses to know the tongue-in-cheek\ndefinition of a good essay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own!\nMost graduation speeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is\nto access Google or dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find\nsomething said by some sage that will grace a graduation ceremony with a lesson you can take\nwith you as you go off into this mysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement, I pored over the sayings of\nthe great minds of the ages: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammad, St. Augustine, Voltaire,\nMartin Luther, Mother Teresa … Kim Kardashian, Lil Wayne.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but as graduating seniors at ESD,\nyou already know them: be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; don’t waste\nyour talents; question authority (but not the Head of School or your parents!); take risks; push the\nenvelope; be true to yourself, to your school, to your country; never promise more than you can\ndeliver; never compromise your integrity; never forget that you have been given talent to do\ngood; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all wise maxims. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if its organizers would forgo a speaker and simply remind the graduating class to read\nand, throughout life, re-read the King James Bible or the Koran or Shakespeare or Confucius—\n2\n\n\fthe ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to.\nFor example, it would tax the capacity of the most powerful search engine to pull up the\ncountless commencement speakers who have lifted and adapted variations of Shakespeare’s lines\nin King Henry VI, Part 2, Act 4, Scene VII—that “ignorance is the curse of God; Knowledge the\nwing wherewith we fly to heaven.”\nThe much-admired and brilliant dean of arts and humanities at Harvard University, Diana\nSorensen, defines a knowledgeable graduate taking wing as follows:\n“He or she is competent in making discerning judgments with tools derived from science,\nengineering, social science, the arts and humanities. He or she should be a persuasive speaker\nwho can articulate the reasons for his positions; who can write with clarity, elegance and\nconceptual power; an innovator who will take risks but first makes sure the limb they go out on\nis a sturdy one; a creative individual who has faced challenges posed by artistic production and\nexperimentation; a global citizen who can speak, read, write in at least a second language; and\nwho will learn what it takes to negotiate different world views emanating from different cultural\ntraditions, a tolerant yet rigorous thinker whose moral compass is guided by ethical reasoning.”\nNow, Class of 2013, I don’t want to put any pressure on you! But that pretty much summarizes\nthe skill set we all hope you have started to acquire at ESD and will now go on to hone in college\nand throughout your lives.\nHow might I, a lowly central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and\nmonetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily, so I dug\ndeep into my memory bank and called upon a source more erudite than the lessons of the Bible,\nthe Koran, Shakespeare or Confucius, and more insightful than Diana Sorensen—my mother,\nMagnhild Andersen Fisher, whom everybody called “Babe.”\n“Babe” Fisher was a stoic Norwegian. She was born and raised in an outpost in South Africa,\nlost her father when she was 4 in the flu pandemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the\ntype of education you have received here at ESD. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a kind of\nfemale Nordic Yogi Berra: She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her three boys. One is\nespecially germane for this evening. My mother would say: “Never let your brains go to your\nhead.” The pun is horrific. But the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to\nkeep your superb education and your considerable talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of\ntalent are necessary, but they are insufficient for success in life.\nTime and again, in business and research labs and universities and government we see instances\nwhere men and women of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with\nthe same devotion they applied to developing their intelligence quotient. My heartfelt advice to\nyou is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ.\nYou all have great futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast, and enjoy it much more,\nif you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person\n3\n\n\fand that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole\nperson is as important an achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of\neducated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for most all commencement orations—a smattering of\nLatin. Commencement speakers at great schools seem to delight in showing off their command\nof an ancient tongue. For example, a serious speaker might conclude this evening’s remarks with\nlabor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor conquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you\ncan’t rest on your laurels or your good family name or an ESD education or just plain good luck.\nYou have to work hard and sweat to succeed. And in doing so, you have to remember mens sana\nin corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is, after all, a festive day! So I will conclude with this:\n“Bubbus, sed possum explicarle; non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\nThis evening I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2013 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam (another Latin phrase!). But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you go through your promising lives remembering that the “whole person is\nthe best person”—my guess is that someday one of you in the Class of 2013 will be standing at\nthis very podium giving the commencement speech to some future generation of graduates. And\nhaving the greatest pleasure a speaker can have: quoting your mom.\nCongratulations, God bless you and good luck!\nThank you.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Oy!\n(With Reference to Ben Bernanke, Ken Arrow, Thomas Jefferson,\nWilliam Shakespeare and the Oracle of Omaha)\n\nRemarks at the 2013 National Association for Business Economics Conference\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nMay 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fFiscal Policy. Oy!\n(With Reference to Ben Bernanke, Ken Arrow, Thomas Jefferson,\nWilliam Shakespeare and the Oracle of Omaha)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Ken (Simonson). I am delighted that the National Association for Business\nEconomics (NABE) has chosen the Dallas Fed’s Houston Branch as the venue for this meeting\non the oil and gas boom as a possible engine for “Reigniting the Economy.” As you will shortly\nhear from my Dallas Fed colleague, Mine Yücel; my wise old colleague from my days at\nTreasury in the 1970s, Phil Verleger; the incoming chairman of our San Antonio Branch, Curt\nAnastasio; and others, this is an intriguing proposition. The technical and entrepreneurial genius\nof Houston and Texas is playing a key role in unlocking our nation’s energy potential. Indeed,\nthere are many here in Texas and abroad—in places as distant as Illinois, Michigan and New\nYork—who argue that reigniting their local economies and the nation’s economy calls for more\n“Texification,” above and beyond the frontiers of energy.\nBut I am not here today to discuss oil and gas or engage in “Texas brag.” I have been asked to\nprovide a broader perspective on the nation’s economic and monetary policy.\nCurrent Predicament of Monetary Policy: A Grand Experiment\nI’ll begin with a summary of the current predicament of monetary policy.\nThe Federal Reserve has undertaken a grand experiment to reignite the economy through\nunprecedented monetary accommodation. We cut to zero the base rate that anchors the yield\ncurve and have pursued a policy aimed at driving rates throughout the curve to historic lows by\nbuying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Our portfolio totals about $3 trillion,\nwhich we have recently been expanding at a rate of $85 billion per month.\nHere is a picture of the domestic securities of the current System Open Market Account (SOMA)\nportfolio.1\n\n1\n\n\fSOMA Domestic Securities Holdings\nBillions of dollars\n3,200\n\nAgencyMBS\nMBS\nAgency\n\nAgencydebt\ndebt\nAgency\n\nTreasurysecurities\nsecurities>3\n> 3years\nTreasury\n\nTreasurysecurities\nsecurities<3\n< 3years\nTreasury\n\n2,800\n2,400\n2,000\n1,600\n1,200\n800\n400\n0\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\n'13\n\nNOTE: Weekly averages. Includes unsettled holdings.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe sea change in the balance sheet in recent years is immediately visible: In sharp contrast to\nthe past, we now hold almost no Treasury notes of less than three years’ duration—the dark blue\nspace. We have purchased in the secondary markets some $1.7 trillion in longer-term\nTreasuries—the light blue area—and, as denoted by the green, more than $1.1 trillion of\nsecurities backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as Fannie\nMae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) and the Government National\nMortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). We live in an age of big numbers when I can say, “Ignore\nthe purple space, for it is only $70 billion in remaining Fannie and Freddie debentures, aka\n‘agency debt.’” Before the crisis, when we didn’t have any agency debt, $70 billion would have\nrepresented 8 percent of our balance sheet.\nAs to the duration of these purchases, here is a picture from year-end 2012:\n\n2\n\n\fAverage Duration of SOMA Holdings\nYears\n9\n8\n\nTotal SOMA\n\nTreasury securities\n\nAgency MBS\n\nAgency debt\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n'09\n\n'10\n\n'11\n\n'12\n\nNOTE: Reported monthly through year-end 2012.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nIncluding securities purchased since then, the total SOMA portfolio has an average duration of\nseven years, with Treasury securities at eight years and MBS having risen to four years.\n\n3\n\n\fAccording to dealers’ forecasts at year-end and as of March, the probability distribution of the\nexpected size of the SOMA portfolio is as follows:\n\nProbability Distribution of Year-End 2014\nSOMA Portfolio Forecasts\nPercent of respondents\n60\n\nDecember\n2012\nSurvey\n(post-FOMC)\nDecember\n2012\nsurvey\n(post-FOMC)\nMarch\nSurvey\nMarch2013\n2013\nsurvey\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n< 2,500\n\n2,500–3,000\n\n3,000–3,500\n\n3,500–4,000\n\n4,000–4,500\n\n4,500–5,000\n\n> 5,000\n\nPar amount (billions of dollars)\nNOTE: Forecasts through 2014.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nSo, you now have a snapshot of where we are. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nhas cut the short-term rate to zero. Being “zero bound,” we instructed our traders to embark on a\nbuying spree of Treasuries and MBS, and they have done so, ballooning our balance sheet from\nits precrisis level of less than $900 billion to about $3.3 trillion. Presently, the committee is\nadding to its holdings at a rate of $85 billion in longer-term securities each month, in addition to\nreinvesting principal payments from holdings of agency MBS and agency debt securities into\nagency MBS. And the predominant sentiment of the “market,” as measured by our dealer\nsurveys, presently posits that we will build our holdings further, to between $3.5 trillion and\npossibly $5 trillion by the end of 2014.\nThe Economy’s Dashboard\nAs to the status of the economy, here is the dashboard our Research Director (and former NABE\nPresident) Harvey Rosenblum uses as a simple graphic to describe the current economic\npredicament:\n\n4\n\n\fU.S. Economic Dashboard\n6.5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n5.5\n\n0.5\n\n8.5\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nUnemployment\nrate\n\n5.5\n\n6 6.5\n\n7\n\n5\n\n10\n\n7.5\n\n8\n8.5\n\n4\n\n9\n\n4.65\n\n3.5\n3\n\nJunk-bond\nspread\n\n1.80\n\n-1.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.5\n\n0\n\n4.5\n\n-1\n\n-2.5\n\nPercent of jobs recovered\n7 0 . 4\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n1.43\n-1\n\nTrimmed Mean\nPCE Inflation\n\n5.5\n6\n\n4.5\n5\n\nWarning\nEngine Unemp.

The dashboard also indicates that at quarter’s end, we were\ncruising along at near stall speed—note the “Engine stall” red warning light. The unemploymentrate gauge is not red because it declined to 7.5 percent in April. And, as indicated by the\nodometer box, we have traveled some distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the\njob creation we might have hoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent\nrecession have been recovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago. The indicator for the\nyield curve, if anything, is robust. Junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent; nominal yields for\neven the lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to\nbelow 7 percent from double digits only a year ago. Further, covenant-light lending is on a tear.\nThe “oil gauge” indicates the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine of job\ncreation.\nProfessional Forecasters Have Been Disappointed Thus Far…\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1\npercent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the\nfraternity of professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed: Forecasts\nmade at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset of this\nyear, the median forecast for 2013 called for 2.4 percent GDP growth, and that, too, has been\nchallenged by first-quarter data that came in below expectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over\nagain.”\n5\n\n\f…But April Could Signal Improvement\nHowever, the April jobs report and revisions of previous jobs data have put some spring back in\neconomists’ steps. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are now back on a downward\ntrend, retreating to prerecession levels, and Monday’s retail sales numbers were a nice upside\nsurprise. This indicates that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in\npayroll taxes, and are reaping the benefits of lower gasoline and food prices. So the recovery\npresently appears to be strong enough to propel hopes that employment growth will continue\nimproving over the near term.\nAs to Inflation …\nOf course, the Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today,\ninflation is benign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, labor compensation rising at\nless than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and expanding energy sources,\nand near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there appears to be little risk that we\nwill see significant cost-push pressures in 2013. In addition, slower growth around the globe is\nputting the damper on demand-pull inflation. Provided that the public remains confident in the\nFed’s commitment to long-run price stability, anchored by the FOMC’s stated commitment to a\ntarget of 2 percent, my reading of the entrails of the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate currently\nindicates we will likely end this year somewhere between 1.5 percent and our 2 percent long-run\ngoal.2\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue at present\nis not a meaningful threat to price stability in the immediate future. The issue is job creation.\nAnd the questions I keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our ability to affect it.\nTime to Reset the Fed’s Sails?\nHaving spent the happiest of my formative years preparing for and attending the U.S. Naval\nAcademy, then paying my way through Harvard sailing oceangoing yachts as a hired hand, I am\ngiven to seafaring analogies. Here is how I would summarize our most recent journey:\nThe current chairman, Ben Bernanke, took the wheel at the Fed just as we sailed into a tempest\nthat nearly capsized our economy. He and his able crew kept the ship of the economy from\nfloundering and navigated it past the rocks of depression and deflation. The Bernanke-led FOMC\nsteered clear of the shoals of economic collapse by jury-rigging the vessel of monetary policy in\nan unconventional and unprecedented manner. Now the ship of the Fed is in more benign waters\nand is sailing forward. The question before us is this: Are we moving forward at sufficient speed\nto allow the Fed to reset our rigging and our sails, eventually going back to a more conventional\nconfiguration?\n\n6\n\n\fThe answer lies in the economic outlook. I am wary of giving pinpoint forecasts of economic\ngrowth. As I mentioned earlier, professional forecasters, including the very capable staff of the\nFederal Reserve, have fallen short on this front, time and again, during the recovery and on\nnumerous occasions before that. I am always mindful of the memorable comments of Ken\nArrow. You may recall them:\nDuring World War II, Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army Air Corps. He and his team\nwere charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being a disciplined analyst, Arrow\nreviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed statistically that the corps’\nforecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked to be relieved of this futile\nduty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was priceless: “The commanding\ngeneral is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning\npurposes.”\nWith that caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the present\nGDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be\nunderestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence,\ncontributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer surveys indicate\nthat commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious.3\nThe snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector\nhave made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in\nTexas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and no longer appear to be a\nmajor drag on growth. As this audience knows better than anybody, new technologies are\nproviding for cheaper and more abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming. Monetary\npolicy is hyper-accommodative, driving interest rates to historic lows and equity markets to\nhistoric highs; if anything, it may be giving rise to excessive speculation and risk taking. (In\naddition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant lending, margin debt is\nclimbing rapidly.)\nI have advocated that we begin to reef in the sails, beginning with our MBS purchase program.\nIn my view, the housing market is on a self-sustaining path and does not need the same impetus\nwe have been giving it. In recent months, under its balance-sheet expansion program, the Fed has\nbought about 50 percent of gross issuance of agency MBS, partly to replace prepayments of our\nMBS holdings. When refinancing activity eventually shifts down, the Fed could soon be buying\nup to 100 percent of MBS issuance if the current purchase program continues. I believe buying\nsuch a high share of gross issuance in any security is not only excessive, but also potentially\ndisruptive to the proper functioning of the MBS market. I have never been comfortable with our\ninvesting in anything but Treasuries, being wary of a central bank engaging in credit allocation\nand favoring specific sectors of the economy. It brings to mind the fears Thomas Jefferson and\nJames Madison had about the slippery slope of Alexander Hamilton’s First Bank of the United\nStates, recently recalled in Jon Meacham’s brilliant book on Jefferson: “They feared that the\n7\n\n\fHamiltonian program would enable financial speculators to benefit from commercial transactions\nmade possible by government funds.”4\nYet I admit that given the crucial role housing plays in our economy and the dire straits the\nhousing market was in at the time, I did hold my nose and vote for the first tranche of MBS\npurchases. I believe that initiative was helpful in jump-starting the housing market. But now I\nbelieve the efficacy of continued purchases is questionable. And I consider holding $1.1 trillion\nand counting of MBS as a possible impairment to our ability to maneuver our balance sheet with\nthe nimbleness and alacrity we might need. I think we can rightly declare victory on the housing\nfront and reef in (or dial back) our purchases, with the aim of eliminating them entirely as the\nyear wears on.\nEnter Fiscal Policy. Oy!\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the\ncurrent dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable\nbrake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC:\n“…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”5\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\nAs it is early in the morning and a little levity is always helpful in making a point, here is my\nfavorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Df_6r_tZqGo\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to\nspend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They\njust didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison: “We are ruined, Sir, if we do not\noverrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’ [and] ‘that a\npublic debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’”6 The good news is that, some 200-plus years\nlater, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein in\nCongress’ spendthrift ways and there have been improvements that have brightened the shortterm outlook for the level of federal debt.7 But, as yet, there has been little more than passive\naction. Until the Congress and the president provide a clear road map as to how fiscal rectitude\nwill be implemented, this lack of credible details for limiting the debt-to-GDP ratio and\nreengineering fiscal policy to stimulate rather than constrain growth is creating undue uncertainty\nabout future tax rates, future government purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of\nfactors that impact employment and economic growth. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty\nposturing of those who must determine the fiscal path of the nation is further undermining\nconfidence and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\n8\n\n\fHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail,\nexpansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those\npurchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates. If you are an operating\nbusiness, you have to discount this risk before adding significantly to payrolls and before\nundertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to consider how the opposite approach\nof cutting government expenditures might impact your top line if the cuts are in areas that affect\nthe markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous uncertainty about how health care reform\nwill impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact that community bankers—providers of\nthe lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the impetus for new job creation and\neconomic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome regulations and fees imposed in response\nto the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If you consider the economy from this\nperspective, you can see where brakes of our own government’s making are being applied to a\nrealization of our growth potential.\nDecisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses;\ndecisionmaking in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of\nhyper-accommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining\ninfluence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the\nbalance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment unless our fiscal\nauthorities get their act together. Those economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls\nand put the American people back to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and\nregulation makers—the legislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending\nhabits and the regulatory regime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made\navailable to invest in job-creating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then,\nI argue that the Fed is, at best, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for a\nmassive shipboard fire of eventual inflation.\nAll the World’s a Stage (and All the Policymakers Merely Players)\nIt is thus as-yet unclear whether the benefits of the strategy the Fed has taken outweigh its costs.\nOnly time will tell. The Federal Open Market Committee will have to wait for the verdict of\nhistory. Scholars know that Shakespearian plays all have five acts. I would suggest that we are\nbut in the third act of a play—we had the tempest in Act 1; the jury-rigging of monetary policy\nand radical maneuvers by the Fed to save the ship in Act 2; and in the present act, we are back on\ncourse but somewhat becalmed, sailing at less-than-desired cruising speed even as we have\ncranked up an auxiliary motor of large-scale asset purchases. Act 4 will involve the travails and\nchallenges of adjusting our policy course, fine-tuning the motor and rearranging the rigging. And\nnot until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome that is the\nhallmark of most romantic plays, or whether the melancholy that defines a tragedy awaits us.\n\n9\n\n\fThe romantic outcome ends, as most all Shakespearian comedies do, in a marriage—in this case,\na marriage of sensible fiscal and monetary policy that lifts employment and carries the American\neconomy to new heights.\nThe tragic outcome is one in which the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the president—are\nunable to provide incentives for risk takers to make use of the cheap and abundant capital the\nFed has made available, and the play ends in a debasement of the central bank and the ruination\nof our economy and lifestyle.\nThe former outcome is that envisioned by the theoreticians that lead the Fed: According to this\nplot, by driving rates to historical lows along the entire length of the yield curve, investors will\nrebalance their portfolios and reach out to riskier assets, providing the financial wherewithal for\nbusinesses to increase capital expenditures and reengage workers, expand payrolls and\nregenerate consumption. Rising prices of bonds, stocks and other financial instruments will\nbolster consumer confidence. The CliffsNotes account of this play has the widely heralded\n“wealth effect” paving the way for economic expansion, thus saving the day.\nThe latter outcome posits that the wealth effect is limited, for two possible reasons. One is that\nour continued purchases of Treasuries are having decreasing effects on private borrowing costs,\ngiven how low long-term Treasury rates already are. Another is that the uncertainty resulting\nfrom fiscal tomfoolery is a serious obstacle to restoring full employment. Until job creators are\nproperly incentivized by fiscal and regulatory policy to harness the cheap and abundant money\nwe at the Fed have engineered, these funds will predominantly benefit those with the means to\nspeculate, tilling the fields of finance for returns that are enabled by historically low rates but do\nnot readily result in job expansion. Cheap capital inures to the benefit of the Warren Buffetts,\nwho can discount lower hurdle rates to achieve their investors’ expectations, accumulating\nholdings without necessarily expanding employment or the wealth of the overall economy.\nI hold no vendetta against the Buffetts of the world, having once been a junior member of that\nclass—I made a nice living during the 1980s and ’90s buying operating assets for nickels and\ndimes and turning them into dollars by rationalizing and downsizing them. And like legions of\nothers, I have for countless years read the Oracle of Omaha’s annual statement with admiration\nfor his prowess as an investor and profit-seeker. But my role as a policymaker is different from\nmy previous role as an investor: I have sworn fealty to a dual mandate of conducting monetary\npolicy so as to maintain price stability AND create the monetary conditions for full employment\nand prosperity for all, not just for the rich and the quick. This, I fear, we will fail to do unless\nCongress and the president develop and deliver on a strategy that complements ours at the Fed.\nThis may be a sour ending to a somber song, but, after all, economics is not called “the dismal\nscience” for nothing. Have a nice day!\n\n10\n\n\fNow, in the best tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering your\nquestions.\nNotes\n1\n\nFor more information, see the New York Fed’s website at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma/sysopen_accholdings.html or the 2012 SOMA annual report at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/omo/omo2012.pdf.\n2\nFor the latest reading of the Dallas Fed’s alternative measure of core inflation, see\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n3\nFor more information regarding the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/201305/default.htm.\n4\nSee Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, by Jon Meacham, New York: Random House, 2012, p. 249.\n5\nThe latest statement by the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors on the stance\nof monetary policy can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20130501a.htm.\n6\nSee note 4, p. 251.\n7\nSee “Our Debt Problems Are Still Far from Solved,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May\n15, 2013.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Fisher\nI so appreciate being here at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), my first outing since\nreturning from a trip to the United Arab Emirates. The founder of the Emirates—a collection of\nformer “Trucial States” along the lower coast of the Arabian Sea—was Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan\nAl Nahyan, a wise man who had no formal education but knew of its enormous value. He said,\n“Education is a lantern which lights the dark alleys of ignorance.”1\nI mention this because I cannot think of an educator who embodies this practical dictum better\nthan Diana Natalicio. President Natalicio is a bright, shining lantern in the world of education.\nActually, that’s an understatement: She is a klieg light! We are blessed to have her lead UTEP\nand move Texas and the nation forward on the frontiers of higher education. I am tremendously\nhonored to be introduced by her. Thank you, Diana.\nI am going to depart from my usual format today and rely heavily on slides—slides that provide\na factual basis for what is going to be a dose of “Texas brag.” With its branches in El Paso, San\nAntonio and Houston, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—the Federal Reserve’s Eleventh\nDistrict—covers about 27 million people over 360,000 square miles stretching from northern\nLouisiana to southern New Mexico. Over 96 percent of the economic output of the district comes\nfrom Texas.\nI find that when I speak about my district in foreign lands—say, in New York or Washington,\nD.C.—there is a stereotypical reaction not unlike the image projected by the TV show Dallas.\n“Of course you are doing well,” they say. “You are rich in oil and gas, blondes and overaccessorized brunettes, and ruthless, hard-drinking cowboys.” Today, I want to set the record\nstraight.\nPrices Are Presently Stable; Employment Is Far From Optimal; the Efficacy of\nQuantitative Easing Is as Yet Unclear\nThe road to dignity is through work: Jobs provide the means for economic advancement. As the\nnation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining price stability—a common\nmonetary policy goal of all responsible central banks. But under the laws created by Congress\nthat govern our franchise and allow it to operate independently, the Fed works under a dual\nmandate—to conduct monetary policy that keeps prices from inflating or deflating and to\nachieve full employment.\nAt the moment, and for the foreseeable future, neither inflation nor deflation appears on the\nforecast horizon. However, the longer-term inflationary consequences of the massive quantitative\neasing programs we have undertaken—programs I have opposed in our Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) meetings but that have been approved by the majority of the committee—\n1\n\n\fare as yet unclear. Those aftereffects will depend on how artful the committee will be in\nunwinding that accommodation on a timely basis. Indeed, one of the signal achievements of\nFederal Reserve policy under Ben Bernanke’s leadership is to have formalized a long-term\ninflation target of 2 percent, something the FOMC had never before distinctly declared.\nPresently, the 12-month inflation rate is 1.6 percent, according to our calculation at the Dallas\nFed, where we do a “trimmed mean” analysis of 178 items consumers use, including guns and\nbeer (hopefully not enjoyed simultaneously) and the cost of gasoline, food, getting your hair cut\nor your shoes repaired, or buying an electronic device. Given that the trimmed mean analysis has\nproven to be an excellent rule-of-thumb predictor of headline inflation one year forward, we can\nsay with some degree of confidence that, at present, we are keeping inflation at or below our 2\npercent target.\nEmployment, however, is not at a comfortable level. Pick up any newspaper or go to any news\nwebsite or broadcast medium and you will read or hear of the still-too-high unemployment rate\nthat bedevils our economy. Monetary policy acts with a lag, including unorthodox monetary\npolicy as it is now being conducted. It would appear from some studies and from anecdotal\nevidence that companies are starting to use the copious cheap money they have access to for\ninvesting in capital projects and employing increasing amounts of workers.2 But it is not yet clear\nthat we will achieve a justifiable bang for the trillions of bucks the Fed has flooded the economy\nwith. Only time will tell if the efficacy of quantitative easing we have undertaken was justifiable\nin regard to job creation and delivering on the second component of our dual mandate.\nYet many things do emerge when you examine the entrails of employment data from across the\ncountry. One thing is that you learn a lot about Texas, which is the focus of my remarks today.\n‘If You Pull Texas Out of the Puzzle, the Country Falls Down’\nFor the past 22 years, Texas has outgrown the country by a factor of more than 2-to-1. Here is a\nslide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and for the U.S. as\na whole since 1990:\n\n2\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 1990 in Selected States\nIndex, January 1990 = 100\n170\nTexas\n\n160\n150\n\nFlorida\n\n140\n130\n\nU.S.\n120\n\nCalifornia\nIllinois\n\n110\n100\n\nMichigan\n\nNew York\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nAnd here is a look at the rate of job creation for those same states and the U.S. as a whole since\n2000:\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 2000 in Selected States\nIndex, January 2000 = 100\n125\nTexas\n\n120\n115\n110\n\nFlorida\n\n105\n\nNew York\nU.S.\nCalifornia\n\n100\n95\n\nIllinois\n\n90\n\nMichigan\n\n85\n80\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nWe were one of the last states to go into the recent recession and one of the first to come out. In\nterms of jobs, as of now, 10 states have come back to or have exceeded employment levels that\n\n3\n\n\fprevailed before the crisis: Alaska, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota,\nOklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\nThe Federal Reserve has no index that measures the number of blondes or ruthless cowboys in\nTexas, but we can account for the influence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas\nextraction and mining support directly accounts for 2.4 percent of our workforce—two-pointfour percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution to our state’s gross domestic product\n(GDP) is roughly 10 percent. So yes, the foreigners are correct: We have a strong energy sector\nin Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. We produce more oil than\nVenezuela and more natural gas than Canada. On net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit\nTexans.\nBut look at this slide of the number of jobs created by sector in 2012:\n\n2012 Employment Growth in Texas\nThousands of jobs\n80\n70\n\nTotal number of jobs created in 2012 = 335,500\n74.2\n\n62\n\n60\n\n52.4\n\n50\n41\n40\n27\n\n30\n18.4\n\n20\n\n22.1\n16.2\n\n9.7\n\n10\n0\n-10\n\nTrade,\ntransp &\nutilities\n(20%)\n\nProf. &\nGovernment Educational & business\nservices\nhealth\nservices\n(16.3%)\n(13.1%)\n(13.4%)\n\n-0.3\nOil & gas\nLeisure & Manufacturing Financial Construction extraction and\nInformation\nactivities\nmining\nhospitality\n(5.4%)\n(7.9%)\n(1.8%)\n(6%)\nsupport (2.4%)\n(10.1%)\n\nNOTES: Categories are North American Industry Classification System supersectors. Data seasonally adjusted.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 22,100, or less than 7 percent, of\nthe 335,500 jobs created in Texas last year. Professional and business services accounted for\n74,200; trade, transportation and utilities 62,000; leisure and hospitality 52,400; educational and\nhealth services 41,000; and construction 27,000. Each of these sectors created more jobs than the\nenergy sector. Of course, the oil and gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic\nimpact is greater than just these 22,100 jobs. The University of Texas at San Antonio—your\nsister organization—estimates that the Eagle Ford Shale generated over $61 billion in economic\nimpact in 2012. As this chart shows, however, ours is a diversified economy, creating jobs across\nthe spectrum.\n“But these jobs are all low paying,” our uninformed friends say. And to that I respond: “You are\nright. We create more low-paying jobs in Texas than anybody else. Yet look at this breakdown of\n\n4\n\n\fjob creation by income quartile for Texas versus the United States minus Texas for the past 10plus years”:\n\nJob Growth by Wage Quartile,\n2001-12\nPercent change\n30\n\n26.5\n24.2\n\n25\nTexas\n\n20\n15\n\nU.S. minus Texas\n14.1\n\n12.6\n\n10\n5\n\n5.5\n\n5.1\n0.1\n\n0\n-5\n\n-6.0\n-10\nLowest wage quartile\n\nLower-middle wage\nquartile\n\nUpper-middle wage\nquartile\n\nHighest wage quartile\n\nNOTES: Calculations include workers over age 15 with positive wages.

But we also created far more high-paying jobs. Most\nimportantly, while the United States has seen job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles,\nTexas has created jobs for those vital middle-income workers, too.\nThe bottom line—we have experienced growth across all sectors and in all income categories.\nAnd it continues: In February, job growth in Texas was an annualized 6.9 percent. Year to date,\nconstruction, trade and transportation, and professional and business services have led the pack\nin what we believe will be another year of employment growth that, knock on wood, will\napproach 3 percent.\nHere are some other facts that help round out the economic picture of our state.\nOur banks are more profitable than those in the rest of the nation …\n\n5\n\n\fShare of Unprofitable Banks in\nthe U.S. and 11th District\nPercent of banks reporting net loss\n35\n31\n30\nU.S.\n\n11th District\n\n25\n\n22\n\n20\n15\n\n14\n\n15\n\n12\n10\n\n10\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n0\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIn the housing sector, we have fewer underwater mortgages …\n\nTexas Has a Lower Share of\nUnderwater Mortgages\nPercent of mortgages with balance > home value*\n60\n52\n50\n40\n40\n\n35\n32\n\n30\n\n25\n22\n\n20\n9\n\n10\n0\nNevada\n\nFlorida\n\nArizona\n\nMichigan\n\n* As of fourth quarter 2012.\nSOURCE: CoreLogic.\n\nRobust new-home construction …\n\n6\n\nCalifornia\n\nTexas\n\nU.S.\n\n\fTexas New-Home Construction\nIndex, January 2005 =100*\n180\nMultifamily permits\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\nSingle-family permits\n\n60\n40\n\nResidential housing starts\n\n20\n0\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n* NOTE: Seasonally adjusted, five-month moving average.\nSOURCES: U.S. Census Bureau; Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\nAnd an export sector that has come out of the recession like gee-whiz.

He came home with the piece that was Texas\n7\n\n\fand a smirk on his face: “Mom,” he said, “guess what? If you pull Texas out of the puzzle of the\nUnited States, the rest of the country falls down!”\nAlthough little Charles lives in Massachusetts, he gets the picture. It came as no surprise when a\nrecent study by the highly respected Brookings Institution, as reported in the Wall Street Journal\nlast week, revealed that only 14 of the nation’s 100 biggest metropolitan areas have more people\nemployed than they did before the 2007–09 recession and that six of them are in Texas: Austin,\nSan Antonio, McAllen, Dallas, Houston and … El Paso. “Robust employment in the oil and gas\nindustries helped the Texas cities,” the article read, “although data from the Texas Workforce\nCommission suggests the job recovery has come from a variety of industries.”3 Amen to that.\nEl Paso at a Crossroads\nYou’ll note that El Paso was mentioned in the Brookings study. Let’s talk a little about this\nunique city.\nIt’s no small wonder that of the 23,000 students enrolled at UTEP, 77 percent are Mexican–\nAmericans and another 6 percent commute from Ciudad Juárez, across the border. El Paso is at\nthe very nexus of the cultures and economies of two countries. As Roberto Coronado, our\neconomist and assistant vice president in charge at our El Paso Branch, likes to point out, “Given\nits unique geographic position, El Paso is very good at importing recessions both from the north\nand from the south of the Rio Grande.” I would add that it’s also good at drawing from the best\nof both countries in recoveries. The El Paso labor market has outperformed that of the U.S. for\nseveral years. Here is a graph that shows how the El Paso employment picture has changed\nrelative to the U.S. since the onset of the Great Recession:\n\nComparing the Recovery in the\nEl Paso and U.S. Labor Markets\nIndex, December 2007 = 100\n104\n\nEl Paso\n\n2.9%\n\n102\n100\n\n-2.2%\n98\nU.S.\n\n96\n94\n92\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; HAVER Analytics.\n\nNow, as the following chart demonstrates, it remains a fact that the local employment picture is\nless bright in El Paso than in Texas’s other major metro areas.\n8\n\n\fEmployment by Metro Area\nIndex, peak employment = 100\n110\nAustin\n108\n106\n\nHouston\nTexas\nSan Antonio\n\nT = months from peak employment\n\n104\n\nD-FW\n102\nEl Paso\n100\n98\n96\n94\nT\n\nT +10\n\nT +20\n\nT +30\n\nT +40\n\nT +50\n\nT +60\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThe unemployment rate here is hovering around 9 percent. El Paso’s unemployment rate has\nhistorically been 2 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate and 3.2 percentage points above\nthe Texas rate. In part, this is due to population growth. El Paso had more than 21 million border\ncrossings in 2011 alone. Most of these visitors came to shop, but many stayed and looked for\njobs. These visitors increase the number of job seekers in the unemployment equation, driving\nthe rate upward.\nOf additional concern is that El Paso is more dependent on federal government employment than\nany other Texas city, with 5 percent of your workforce coming from the public sector. And that\nis before accounting for the payroll of Fort Bliss itself and the impact it has on private-sector\nemployment and consumption. Clearly, El Paso is quite vulnerable to constriction in the growth\nof federal spending. This will ultimately present serious challenges as the federal government\nstruggles to right its fiscal imbalances.\nThe Good News\nBut there is good news that offsets that risk:\nThanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA—an agreement that, as Diana\nmentioned, I played a role in implementing as deputy U.S. trade representative—El Paso is no\nlonger at the edge of the United States but, instead, at a strategic location in the vast North\nAmerican market.\nIn this context, the maquiladoras of Ciudad Juárez become an important factor determining El\nPaso’s economic fate. The relationship exists via a ricochet effect that begins with U.S. industrial\nactivity picking up, say in auto manufacturing, followed by new production orders being sent to\nCiudad Juárez maquiladora plants and then economic benefits flowing back to El Paso. The\n9\n\n\fflowback to El Paso comes from firms on this side of the border providing logistical support,\ninsurance and other services to the maquiladoras—as well as in the aforementioned form of\nmaquiladora employees shopping and consuming more on this side of the border. And, as this\ntable shows, it results in an increase of high-value-added sales of El Paso-based services into\nCiudad Juárez, making up for reductions in manufacturing jobs on this side of the border:\n\nCiudad Juárez Maquiladoras’\nImpact on El Paso\nPercent increase per every 10 percent\nincrease in maquiladora output\nTotal employment\n\n2.8\n\nTransportation employment\n\n5.3\n\nRetail trade employment\n\n1.3\n\nFinance, insurance, real estate employment\n\n2.1\n\nServices employment\n\n1.8\n\nManufacturing employment\n\n-1.3\n\nSOURCE: “The Impact of Maquiladoras on U.S. Border Cities,” by Jesus Cañas, Roberto Coronado, Robert W. Gilmer and Eduardo\nSaucedo, Growth and Change, forthcoming.\n\n¡Sigue México!\nAs the maquiladora example illustrates, Mexico has a significant impact on the fate of the El\nPaso economy.\nThis is fortunate because the Mexican economy is being transformed to a greater degree than\nmost people here in El Norte understand.\nOn Sunday, the Dallas Morning News kindly ran an op-ed piece I wrote based on the work of\nour Dallas Fed economists, titled “Mexico Outdoes the U.S. on Fiscal Discipline.”4 The article\noutlines the great progress Mexico has made in transforming its economy and the significant\nsteps taken by President Enrique Peña Nieto in the footsteps of his predecessors, from President\nCalderon back to President Salinas.\nHere are the facts:\nMexico recovered more quickly from the recession than the United States.\nMexico’s 3.3 percent GDP growth in 2012 compares with the U.S.’s 1.7 percent.\nMexico, home to 1980s hyperinflation and a poster child of that decade’s Latin American debt\ncrisis, has recorded a core consumer price index annual inflation rate below 3 percent for the last\n10\n\n\fthree months. In fact, inflation in Mexico has trended down for two decades following two\nimportant reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation targeting in\n2001.\nMeanwhile, the peso, floating since late 1994, held its own through the global financial crisis.\nAnd year to date, the peso has gained 6.9 percent against the dollar.\nLow and stable inflation, together with a steady peso, has protected the purchasing power of the\nMexican consumer and allowed nest eggs to grow. Those nest eggs can now be safely deposited\nin banks. After a horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending,\nMexico’s banking industry is growing again and financial access, while still limited, is\nexpanding quickly. The number of Mexican banks increased 14.3 percent in 2012; in the U.S.,\nthe number of institutions contracted 3.1 percent. It may be surprising to you that Mexican banks\nare also better capitalized than U.S. banks. As of Dec. 31, 2012, equity-to-asset ratios were 11.1\npercent at U.S. banks and 15.9 percent at Mexican banks.\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which\ncompares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers on the right and the\nleft have a commitment to fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and\nhave chosen to abide by it rather than take the “kick the can down the road” approach of the U.S.\nCongress. As a result, Mexico’s national debt is stable at 28 percent of GDP, while here it raced\npast $16 trillion in 2012, about 105 percent of GDP.\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up\n62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico\njoined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade\nOrganization) in 1986 and ratified NAFTA in 1994, it has forged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\nWith all the progress in the macro economy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are\nwhat Mexico now needs to catapult it to a leadership role among emerging-market economies. If\nPresident Peña Nieto’s first 100 days in office are any indication, this critical next step is\nunderway. He has engineered the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico) with the other political\nparties; arrested Elba Esther Gordillo, the corrupt leader of the massive national teachers’ union;\nbrought a class-action suit against Carlos Slim’s growth-retarding telecommunications empire;\nand begun a national conversation about reforming the country’s woefully underperforming, yet\npotentially rich energy sector.\nIf this effort at structural modernization continues, Mexico’s growth will increase significantly.\nAll of this will be good for El Paso. Just as El Paso suffers when recession afflicts both sides of\nthe border, it will prosper as expansion takes hold here in the U.S. and in Mexico.\nThe Good, the Bad and the Comical\nLet me give you a pictorial summary of this lecture:\n\n11\n\n\fWe are blessed by a force of nature named Diana Natalicio (a Texas blonde, by the way!) …\n\nCourtesy of UTEP University Communications\n\nBy UTEP as a symbol of El Paso’s critical place at the crossroads of North America …\n\n12\n\n\fBy having the good fortune to live in Texas …\n\nAnd by sharing a border with an increasingly successful neighbor to our south.\nBut we also have challenges. It would be unbecoming of a central banker to be entirely\noptimistic—we are a pretty sober species. So here is the bad news. Here’s what is holding back\nthe economic progress of El Paso, Texas, Mexico and America:\n\n13\n\n\fYup—Washington. The Federal Reserve has provided plenty of, if not too much, high-octane\nfuel in the form of cheap and abundant money to propel the economy forward. Our southern\nneighbor, Mexico, is responsibly managing its fiscal affairs and structural reforms (as is our\nnorthern neighbor, Canada).\nTexas is showing the nation the way to create jobs and encourage prosperity with a highly\ndiversified economy. And yet Congress and executive branch cannot agree on a budget, or on a\npath forward for taxes and spending, or on a regulatory structure that incentivizes business to put\npeople back to work.\nThis is the subject of an entire separate lecture. But to summarize the root fiscal problem of past\nCongresses and administrations, Democrat- or Republican-led, my staff found a clip on YouTube\nthat sums it up better than words: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df_6r_tZqGo.\nThat sketch says it all. We must all pray that our president and our congressional representatives\nwill find a way to reverse their spendthrift ways and do what is right by putting us back on the\npath of fiscal probity.\nEl Paso and Texas have done well despite the disorderly behavior of our nation’s fiscal\nauthorities. Imagine how well we would do if they actually managed to get their act together!\nAs we eagerly await that day, let us be thankful for the exceptional nature of this great state, this\ngreat city and this wonderful university. ¡Ándale Pues!\nGracias.\n\n14\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nAs quoted by Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, Minister of Culture, Youth and Community Development and\nChancellor, Higher Colleges of Technology, in his speech at Sharjah Women’s College, United Arab Emirates,\nMarch 27, 2013.\n2\nSee “Easy Money: Fed Policies Spur Corporate Spending,” by Victoria McGrane, Wall Street Journal, April 9,\n2013.\n3\nSee “Hiring Spreads, but Only 14 Cities Top Prerecession Level,” by Amy Schatz, Wall Street Journal, March 31,\n2013.\n4\nSee “Mexico Outdoes the U.S. on Fiscal Discipline,” by Richard W.

Fisher\nThank you, Professor [Merit] Janow. The title of this lectureship far overstates my standing and\ncapacity—I am unworthy of being considered “distinguished” at anything other than having\nhelped raise four children whose talents far surpass my own. But I thank you for this\nmomentarily hyperbolic honor.1\nAs Merit mentioned, we go back a long way. Yet my involvement with Columbia University and\nMorningside Heights goes back much further. After I graduated from Harvard in 1971, I needed\nmoney to pay for Oxford, so I spent most of a year working as a busboy and bartender and doing\na number of odd jobs in Washington, D.C.—testimony to the immediate benefits of a Harvard\ndegree in economics! Starved for intellectual sustenance as I waited to return to academia, I\nfound comfort in reading about public policy, especially in the essays of what was then a new\njournal, The Public Interest.\nThe Public Interest was the brainchild of Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell (subsequently joined by\nNathan Glazer)—originally young Trotskyites who had spent their days as students at the City\nCollege of New York (CCNY), the “Harvard of the Proletariat”—“trying to understand how the\nsocialist ideal of political and economic justice had ended in Joseph Stalin’s murderous\ntyranny.”2 They later migrated to what we would now consider prototypical Roosevelt-cumLyndon Johnson liberalism, and then evolved into “neoconservatives.” These three men were\nbecoming iconic public intellectuals, and The Public Interest was something of a personal\njournal of lessons they learned during their ideological transformation.\nKristol and Bell ran a series of evening seminar/workshops here on this campus and at CCNY.\nAt every opportunity, I would take an afternoon off, jump on a bus to New York, attend their\nevening talks, find some kindly student to let me sleep in a dorm room and return by bus to\nWashington the next morning. All this is by way of saying that I have been coming to Columbia\nfor over 40 years, almost as many years as the number of consecutive games lost in the historical\nlosing streak of your illustrious football team.\nI was especially captivated by Irving Kristol. His book, Two Cheers for Capitalism, praised\ncapitalism because, one, “it works, in a quite simple, material sense;” and two, it is “congenial to\na large measure of personal liberty.”3 Kristol famously described himself as “a liberal who had\nbeen mugged by reality.” In writing a loving homage to Kristol when he died, David Brooks of\nthe New York Times summarized the basis for Kristol’s epiphany in more colorful language.\n“The elemental Jewish commandment” in the working-class neighborhood where Kristol grew\nup was: “Don’t be a schmuck. Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the\nway people really are.”4\nAs a member of the team of earnest men and women who form the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I consider myself a central banker who has been mugged by the reality of\n1\n\n\fhaving been an investor and market operator. I am constantly wary of fantastical notions that\nseem cogent in economic or monetary theory but run counter to what I learned in the\nmarketplace or run the risk of departing from practice in the real economy—of possibly having\nnothing to do with the way people and businesses, those who actually operate our economy,\nreally are.\nToday, I am going to discuss two such risks as I see them: the current program of quantitative\neasing and the effect of the Dodd–Frank legislation aimed at preventing “too big to fail.” I’ll do\nthis in short order and as provocatively as possible so as to give professors Calomiris and Svejnar\nplenty of ammo to use during the inquisition that will follow my remarks.\nMonetary Policy and Quantitative Easing\nI have argued against what I have called “Buzz Lightyear” monetary policy—pledging to hold\nthe federal funds rate at zero seemingly to infinity and beyond, while purchasing longer-term\nTreasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, reinvesting principal payments on all\nagency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and purchasing MBS at a pace of\n$40 billion per month.5 Indeed, other than our initial program to underpin a recovery in the\nhousing market with our initial tranche of purchases of MBS, I have opposed all other large-scale\nasset purchases or quantitative easing (QE) programs. Why have I been so obstinate in my\nopposition to this well-intended program?\nI fully understand its theoretical underpinnings. But I question its efficacy.\nConfined as the Fed is at the “zero bound,” the only means of adding monetary fuel to the\neconomy has been to purchase Treasury and MBS securities. When we buy something, we pay\nfor it, putting money into the economy. That money—backed by an assurance that the FOMC\nwill hold interest rates at zero and continue large-scale asset purchases for a prolonged period—\nshould, theoretically, be put to use: a) by banks’ lending to consumers and to businesses that will\nexpand employment, or b) by investors who, rediscounting valuations in the fixed-income and\nequity markets, will drive those markets higher in price, creating a “wealth effect.” This wealth\neffect should lead to further consumption as well as greater employment by businesses whose\nbalance sheets have been reconfigured and enriched both by the cheapest leverage in American\nhistory and by booming prices for their stock.\nAll these actions are in keeping with the dual mandate that the Federal Reserve was given by the\nCongress of the United States. It calls for us to operate independently both to maintain price\nstability and conduct policy in a way that engenders full employment. Given that inflation and,\nimportantly, inflationary expectations are presently “contained,” it would seem theoretically\ncompelling to pursue the policy that we have undertaken.\nBut a not-so-funny thing has happened on the way to the reality forum. While bankers and other\nsources of credit have slowly but consistently liberalized their lending practices, borrowers have\nnot been especially keen to put cheap and super-abundant credit to use in expanding payrolls to\nthe degree the FOMC desires.\nTo be sure, we have, as hoped, seen a reinvigorated housing market. Indeed, FOMC records will\nshow that based on the superb work done by two housing-market experts at the Dallas Fed—\nJohn Duca and Anthony Murphy, working with John Muellbauer at Oxford—and thanks to our\n2\n\n\ffield soundings with housing and housing-related business leaders, the Dallas Fed was way\nahead of others at the FOMC table both in warning of the housing market debacle and then\nrecognizing the housing recovery.6 The fact that the housing-market gears have now begun to\nmesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed\nsecurities purchase program at the current pace and would suggest tapering off those purchases.\nAs to the more broadly impactful Treasury purchases, occurring as they have simultaneously\nwith a loss of confidence in the euro bond markets—I like to say that, relatively speaking, the\nU.S. economy has been the “best-looking horse in the glue factory”—they have indeed led to a\nmassive bond and stock market rally. For the ninth time in U.S. history, we have experienced a\ndoubling of the market indexes; corporate borrowing rates are at the lowest levels on record,\nincluding those for CCC-rated credits that are just north of default.\nThat’s the good news. Some sharp market operators have done very well. For private-equity\nfirms, for example, hyper-accommodative monetary policy has offered a chance to go back to the\nglories of payment-in-kind and other financial techniques that enrich financiers but may not\ncreate employment. For the largest banks and financial institutions, policy has helped dig them\nout of the holes in which they found themselves (including the hole of executive compensation).\nAnd for the wealthiest investors, even unto the revered Oracle of Omaha, there has been the\nwindfall of super-abundant credit that, after adjusting for tax deductions on interest and a\nmodicum of inflation, is practically free. Ordinary savers and retirees have benefited from the\nturnaround in the all-important housing sector, but with the remainder of their savings, they have\nbeen waylaid on the sidelines of the zero bound. In addition, the 5,500 or so smaller banks that\nare the backbone of our communities have seen their interest margins squeezed severely. The\nwealth effect, in other words, has been unbalanced. Main Street does not seem to have been\nimpacted to the same degree as Wall Street.\nTo be sure, as mentioned, businesses have been able to improve their balance sheets and are\nenjoying higher stock market valuations of their businesses. However, thus far, businesses have\npursued payroll-expanding job creation with less enthusiasm than had been hoped for.\nUnemployment remains annoyingly high. There are some pockets of exception like Texas, which\nnow operates at employment levels 3.1 percent above its prerecession peak and, over the last\ndecade, has created jobs across the entire income spectrum. Nationwide, meanwhile, job creation\nhas been weak and in the important middle-income quartiles has been shrinking.\nEmployers large and small, privately owned or publicly traded, will tell you that despite access\nto cheap and abundant capital, they are hesitant to make long-term commitments, including\nhiring significant numbers of permanent workers. They cite uncertain growth prospects for the\ngoods and services they sell at home, where consumption is retarded by slow growth in\nemployment and, lately, by the increase in payroll taxes. And abroad, these employers point to\nthe dampened consumption stemming from the economic debacle in Europe and its knock-on\neffects on China and the export-led emerging economies. They are uncertain about fiscal policy,\nnot knowing what their taxes will be and what will happen to all-important federal spending that\ndirectly impacts them or their customers. They are uncertain as to the ultimate effect on their cost\nstructures of the seemingly endless expansion of health care and other mandates and regulations,\nhowever meritorious their intention. And, for some, there is a deeply imbedded worry that the\nFed’s contortion of the yield curve and cost of money cannot last forever, or, if it lasts too long,\n3\n\n\fwill eventually result in financial bubbles and/or uncontrollable inflation, adding another\nuncertainty to the plethora of uncertain factors that already plague them.\nAs I walked down memory lane in preparation for this lecture today, I thought of my days at\nbusiness school in the mid-1970s. Everything we learned in business school was oriented toward\noperating and growing companies under the assumption of constrained, conservative debt\nmarkets and a fundamentals-driven equity market. Today, the opposite obtains: Credit is superabundant and stock market behavior is conditioned not so much by the fundamental performance\nof its underlying companies but by increasing doses of monetary Ritalin.7 Against this backdrop,\nI am not surprised by the reaction of businesses. Operating in a highly uncertain environment, it\nis eminently sensible for them to defensively use their newly strengthened balance sheets to buy\nback shares and pay out dividends or employ them offensively in ways—say, in making\nacquisitions—that often lead to employee rationalization, not payroll expansion for U.S.\nworkers.\nThis is how businesses really think; this is the way people really are.\nThe bottom line is that rather than achieve the intended theoretical effect, I believe the policy of\nsuper-abundant money at costs deviating substantially from normal equilibrium levels may\nultimately prove to be counterproductive. Or it may restrain the benefits that theory might\nsuggest.\nIf this is so, should we continue with the current program of QE? I have argued we should not,\nthat we are pushing on a string. But let me qualify this. I was, indeed, against the escalating\nrounds of QE, questioning their efficacy. But now that we have them in place, and the fixedincome and stock markets are hooked on the monetary Ritalin that we have dispensed in everlarger doses, it would, in my opinion, do great harm to force a sudden withdrawal. So, I have\nargued that it would be best to taper the dose of QE so that markets can adjust gradually to the\neventual removal of this treatment and return to pricing securities on the basis of fundamentals.\nAm I right or wrong? I pose this question to professors Calomiris and Svejnar for the discussion\nthat will follow.\nLet me add one more thought for the good professors to contemplate before moving on to the\ntopic of too big to fail (TBTF). This is, admittedly, out of left (or perhaps in the spirit of Irving\nKristol, right) field: Having posited that, thus far, the wealth-effect phenomenon has been\nconcentrated in both the housing sector—a Main Street benefit, and a powerful one—and the\nhands of the savviest operators—those most able to exploit free and abundant money, primarily a\nsmaller base consisting of the big banks and the investment community on Wall Street—and\ngiven that private sector job creators are in a defensive crouch and the federal government is\nlikely to remain in cost-containment mode, might there be a way for others charged with\nfiduciary responsibility to the broader public to capitalize on the current moment?\nFor example, Texas, with its highly rated government credit, has navigated its 26 million people\nthrough the Great Recession with strong fiscal fundamentals and a dynamic economy that has\npersistently outperformed the United States and, indeed, all other large states for at least the past\ntwo decades.8 Might it make sense for Texas to issue ultra-long bonds at currently prevailing\nultra-low rates to finance the state’s longer-term infrastructure needs? I have in mind a Texas\n4\n\n\fCentury Bond. The public benefit would come from saving on interest payments that will\ninevitably rise over time from their unprecedented low levels—certainly sometime in the next\n100 years—meanwhile financing highways, water projects, universities and the like that will be\nneeded to continue serving the state’s growing population and expanding economy. If ever there\nwere a window for such an issuance, it surely would be now.\nDomestic entities seeking to match longer-term liabilities and commitments as well as sovereign\ninvestors like the Norwegians are keen on finding “risk free” dollar-denominated assets of long\nduration. Mexico and private universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have\nplaced century bonds. Because the U.S. government cannot capitalize on such demand and is\nstuck in a rut of issuing short-dated debt so as not to add to its deficits, could or should other\ndollar-based “sovereign” issuers like the best credit-rated states, especially a large one like\nTexas, do so? I’ll just throw that out for your contemplation.\nToo Big to Fail\nNow, on to TBTF.\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed TBTF were at the epicenter of\nthe 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of risk, they\nbecame the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, my colleagues at\nthe Dallas Fed and I submit that they are another key reason accommodative monetary policy\nand government policies have failed to adequately spur the economic recovery. Our research\ndirector, Harvey Rosenblum, and I first wrote about this in an article published in the Wall Street\nJournal in September 2009, titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”9 Put simply, sick banks\ndon’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—megabanks severely constricted their usual\nlending and capital-market activities during the crisis and economic recovery. They brought\neconomic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of the banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very\npreamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated the weakness in economic growth by increasing\nregulatory uncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. Despite its good intention, it has been\ncounterproductive, working against solving the core problems it seeks to address.\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers, creditors, shareholders and customers believe them to be exempt\nfrom the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial\nupside of their actions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone\nwrong, in violation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be\npracticed in the United States). Such firms enjoy implicit subsidies relative to their non-TBTF\ncompetitors. They are thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the\npresumption that bankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of a financial institution deemed to be so large,\ninterconnected and/or complex that its failure could substantially damage the financial system.\n5\n\n\fBy reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from excessive risk taking, such policies\nundermine the discipline that market forces normally assert on management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given the\neconomies of scale in handling regulation, Dodd–Frank’s excessive complexity works to\nundermine the competitiveness of smaller banks, thereby offsetting some of the act’s other\naspects that curtail TBTF banks’ dominance. It unwittingly exacerbates the problem it set out to\nsolve.\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”10 I highly recommend this speech to you.\nHaldane noted that Dodd–Frank comes against a backdrop of ever-greater escalation of financial\nregulation. He pointed out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call\nreports” after the formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The\nFederal Reserve Act of 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them\nsubmitted to the Federal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane\nnoted, these reports numbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding\ncompanies] covered 547 columns in Excel; by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271\ncolumns.” “Fortunately,” he added wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the\nincrease.”\nThough this increasingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the\ndebacle of 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The\nlegislation has 16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than\n8,800 pages of regulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done.\nIn his speech, Haldane noted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register\nshowed that complying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He\nadded: “Of course, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they\ndelivered even modest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He went on to\nargue the wick is not worth the candle, before concluding: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps\ntoo complex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity.”\nThis case for more effectively treating TBTF is especially compelling given the subsidy these\ninstitutions now enjoy by virtue of their protected status.\n6\n\n\fThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen after the financial crisis. Recent estimates by the\nBank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government guarantee\nprovides the largest U.S. bank holding companies with an average credit rating uplift of more\nthan two notches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to\nsmaller competitors.11 Our aforementioned friend, Andy Haldane, estimates the implicit TBTF\nglobal subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified by the\nFinancial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”12 To put that $300 billion\nestimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. bank holding companies summed together\nreported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nHarvey Rosenblum and I, and our team at the Dallas Fed, have proposed a simple amendment to\nDodd–Frank to remedy the TBTF pathology. We would eliminate the mumbo-jumbo, ineffective\nand costly complexity of the law; relieve the regulatory imposition it imposes on non-TBTF\nbanks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or financial system; and eliminate\nthe unfair subsidy the TBTF holding companies enjoy at the expense of their smaller\ncompetitors. Our proposal would effectively level the playing field for all banking organizations\nand provide better protection for taxpaying citizens.\nI laid our proposal out in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 16. You might access it and\nstudy its details.13 In a nutshell, we recommend that within a complex bank holding company,\nonly the commercial banking operations that intermediate short-term deposits into longer-term\nloans would benefit from federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount\nwindow. All other operations of a complex bank holding company and all “shadow banking”\naffiliates of that company would not have this protection or access to the Fed’s window. To\nreinforce the understanding that taxpayers will not come to the aid of the risks taken by those\nentities, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every shadow-banking affiliate and of the\nsenior holding company would be required to sign a new covenant, a simple disclosure that need\nbe no more complex than this: “Conducting business with this affiliate of XYZ bank holding\ncompany carries NO federal deposit insurance or other government protection or guarantees. The\ncounterparty herein fully understands that in conducting business with XYZ’s banking affiliate,\nit has NO federal government protection or guarantees, and its investment is totally at risk.”\nUnfortunately, established customer relationships are slow to change. To accelerate the transition\nto a more competitive financial system, our proposal has a third element to help level the playing\nfield. Specifically, we recommend that the largest financial institutions be restructured so that\nevery one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of\nbanking entities, that each be of a size that is “too small to save.” This would underscore to\ncustomers and creditors that a credible regime shift has taken place, and the reign of TBTF\npolicies is over.\nTo circle back to Irving Kristol, I believe this suggested remedy to the pathology of TBTF\n“works, in a quite simple, material sense” and is “congenial to a large measure of personal\nliberty.” It most certainly dispenses with fantastical notions of the way people really are.\nI have thrown a lot at you in this long speech. Thank you for tolerating me. Now, in the best\ntradition of central bankers, I will do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you and the\ngood professors present may ask.\n7\n\n\fNotes\n1\n\nColumbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, Spring 2013 Distinguished Speaker in\nInternational Finance and Economic Policy.\n2\n“About the film: Finding My Way to the Alcoves (1999),” by director Joseph Dorman, PBS Online.\n3\nTwo Cheers for Capitalism, by Irving Kristol (New York: Basic Books 1978).\n4\n“Three Cheers for Irving,” by David Brooks, New York Times, Sept. 22, 2009, p.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEnding ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to be introduced by my college classmate, John Henry. John is a descendant of the\niconic patriot, Patrick Henry. Most of John’s ancestors were prominent colonial Virginians and\nmany were anti-crown. Patrick, however, was the most outspoken. Ask John why this was so,\nand he will answer: “Patrick was poor.”\nHowever poor he may have been, Patrick Henry was a rich orator. In one of his greatest\nspeeches, he said: “Different men often see the same subject in different lights; and therefore, I\nhope that it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions\nof a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without\nreserve. This is no time for ceremony … [it] is one of awful moment to this country.”\nPatrick Henry was addressing the repression of the American colonies by the British crown.\nTonight, I wish to speak to a different kind of repression—the injustice of being held hostage to\nlarge financial institutions considered “too big to fail,” or TBTF for short.\nI submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the\nAmerican people. Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit\nthe advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.\nI have spoken of this for several years, beginning with a speech on the “Pathology of Too-Bigto-Fail” in July 2009.1 My colleague, Harvey Rosenblum—a highly respected economist and the\nDallas Fed’s director of research—and I and our staff have written about it extensively.\nTomorrow, we will issue a special report that further elucidates our proposal for dealing with the\npathology of TBTF. It also addresses the superior relative performance of community banks\nduring the recent crisis and how they are being victimized by excessive regulation that stems\nfrom responses to the sins of their behemoth counterparts. I urge all of you to read that report.2\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: I speak only for the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for others associated with our central bank. That is usually\nabundantly clear. In many matters, my staff and I entertain opinions that are very different from\nthose of many of our esteemed colleagues elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. Today, I\n“speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve” on the issue of TBTF, while meaning no\ndisrespect to others who may hold different views.\nThe Problem of TBTF\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed too big to fail were at the\nepicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of\nrisk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, we\nsubmit that they are a key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have\nfailed to adequately affect the economic recovery. Harvey Rosenblum and I first wrote about this\n1\n\n\fin an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, “The Blob That Ate\nMonetary Policy.”3 Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—\nmegabanks stopped their lending and capital market activities during the crisis and economic\nrecovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of\nthe banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act.

We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated weak economic growth by increasing regulatory\nuncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. It has clearly benefited many lawyers and\ncreated new layers of bureaucracy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive,\nworking against solving the core problem it seeks to address.\nDefining TBTF\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the\nprocesses of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their\nactions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in\nviolation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced\nin the United States). Such firms enjoy subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They\nare thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that\nbankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of the owners, managers and creditors of a financial\ninstitution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could\nsubstantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from\nexcessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert\non management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition in lending.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given its\ncomplexity, it unwittingly exacerbates them.\nComplexity Bites\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”4 Here are some choice passages from that noteworthy\nspeech.\n2\n\n\fHaldane notes that regulators’ “… efforts to catch the crisis Frisbee have continued to escalate.\nCasual empiricism reveals an ever-growing number of regulators … Ever-larger litters have not,\nhowever, obviously improved the watchdogs’ Frisbee-catching abilities. [After all,] no regulator\nhad the foresight to predict the financial crisis, although some have since exhibited supernatural\npowers of hindsight.\n“So what is the secret of the watchdogs’ failure? The answer is simple. Or rather, it is complexity\n… complex regulation … might not just be costly and cumbersome but sub-optimal. … In\nfinancial regulation, less may be more.”\nOne is reminded of the comment French Prime Minister Clemenceau made about President\nWilson’s 14 points: “Why 14?” he asked. “God did it in 10.”\nWere that we only had 14 points of financial regulation to contend with today. Haldane notes\nthat Dodd–Frank comes against a background of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation.\nHe points out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after\nthe formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act\nof 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the\nFederal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports\nnumbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered\n547 columns in Excel, by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he\nadds wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\nThough this growingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle\nof 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has\n16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of\nregulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done. In his speech, Haldane\nnoted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that\ncomplying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of\ncourse, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even\nmodest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He then goes on to argue the\nwick is not worth the candle. And he concludes: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too\ncomplex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity. Delivering that would require an about-turn.”\nThe Dallas Fed’s Proposal: A Reasonable ‘About-Turn’\nThe Dallas Fed’s proposal offers an “about-turn” and a way to mend the flaws in Dodd–Frank. It\nfights unnecessary complexity with simplicity where appropriate. It eliminates much of the\nmumbo-jumbo, ineffective, costly complexity of Dodd–Frank. Of note, it would be especially\nhelpful to non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or the\nfinancial system. Our proposal would relieve small banks of some unnecessary burdens arising\nfrom Dodd–Frank that unfairly penalize them. Our proposal would effectively level the playing\nfield for all banking organizations in the country and provide the best protection for taxpaying\ncitizens.\n\n3\n\n\fIn a nutshell, we recommend that TBTF financial institutions be restructured into multiple\nbusiness entities. Only the resulting downsized commercial banking operations—and not shadow\nbanking affiliates or the parent company—would benefit from the safety net of federal deposit\ninsurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nDefining the Landscape\nIt is important to have an accurate view of the landscape of banking today in order to understand\nthe impact of this proposal.\nAs of third quarter 2012, there were approximately 5,600 commercial banking organizations in\nthe U.S. The bulk of these—roughly 5,500—were community banks with assets of less than $10\nbillion. These community-focused organizations accounted for 98.6 percent of all banks but only\n12 percent of total industry assets. Another group numbering nearly 70 banking organizations—\nwith assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion—accounted for 1.2 percent of banks, while\ncontrolling 19 percent of industry assets. The remaining group, the megabanks—with assets of\nbetween $250 billion and $2.3 trillion—was made up of a mere 12 institutions. These dozen\nbehemoths accounted for roughly 0.2 percent of all banks, but they held 69 percent of industry\nassets.\n\nThe 12 institutions that presently account for 69 percent of total industry assets are candidates to\nbe considered TBTF because of the threat they could pose to the financial system and the\neconomy should one or more of them get into trouble. By contrast, should any of the other 99.8\n\n4\n\n\fpercent of banking institutions get into trouble, the matter most likely would be settled with\nprivate-sector ownership changes and minimal governmental intervention.\nHow and why does this work for 99.8 percent but not the other 0.2 percent?\nTo answer this question, it helps to consider the sources of regulatory and market discipline\nimposed on each of the three groups of banks.\nLet’s look at two dimensions of regulatory discipline: Potential closure of the institution and the\neffectiveness of supervisory pressure on bank management practices.\nDo the owners and managers of a banking institution operate with the belief that their institution\nis subject to a bankruptcy process that works reasonably quickly to transfer ownership and\ncontrol to another banking entity or entities? Is there a group of interested and involved\nshareholders that can exert a restraining force on franchise-threatening risk taking by the bank’s\ntop management team? Can management be replaced and ownership value wiped out? Is the firm\ncontrolled de facto by its owners, or instead effectively management-controlled?5 In addition, we\nask: To what extent do uninsured creditors of the banking entity impose risk-management\ndiscipline on management?\nThis analytical framework is summarized in the following slide:\n\nLooking across line 1, it is clear that community banks are subject to considerable regulatory and\nshareholder discipline. They can and do fail. In the last few years, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. (FDIC) has built a reputation for regulators carrying out Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of\n5\n\n\f“creative destruction” by taking over small banks on a Friday evening and reopening them on\nMonday morning under new ownership. “In on Friday, out by Monday” is the mantra of this\nprocess.\nKnowing the power of banking supervisors to close the institution, owners and managers of\ncommunity banks heed supervisory suggestions to limit risk. Community banks often have a few\nsignificant shareholders who have a considerable portion of their wealth tied to the fate of the\nbank. Consequently, they exert substantial control over the behavior of management because risk\nand potential closure matter to them. Since community banks derive the bulk of their funding\nfrom federally insured deposits, they are simple rather than complex in their capital structure and\nrarely have uninsured and unsecured creditors. “Market discipline” over management practices is\nprimarily exerted through shareholders.\nOf the three groups, the 70 regional and moderate-sized banking organizations depicted in line 2\nare subject to a broader range of market discipline. Like community banks, these institutions are\nnot exempt from the bankruptcy process; they can and do fail. But given their size, complexity\nand generally larger geographic footprint, the failure resolution and ownership transfer processes\ncannot always be accomplished over a weekend. In practice, owners and managers of mid-sized\ninstitutions are nonetheless aware of the downside consequences of the risks taken by the\ninstitution. Uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors are also aware of their unprotected\nstatus in the event the institution experiences financial difficulties. Mid-sized banking institutions\nreceive a good dose of external discipline from both supervisors and market-based signals.\nTBTF megabanks, depicted in line 3, receive far too little regulatory and market discipline. This\nis unfortunate because their failure, if it were allowed, could disrupt financial markets and the\neconomy. For all intents and purposes, we believe that TBTF banks have not been allowed to fail\noutright.6 Knowing this, the management of TBTF banks can, to a large extent, choose to resist\nthe advice and guidance of their bank supervisors’ efforts to impose regulatory discipline. And\nfor TBTF banks, the forces of market discipline from shareholders and unsecured creditors are\nlimited.\nLet’s first consider discipline from shareholders. Having millions of stockholders has diluted\nshareholders’ ability to prevent the management of TBTF banks from pursuing corporate\nstrategies that are profitable for management, though not necessarily for shareholders.\nAs we learned during the crisis, adverse information on poor financial performance often is\navailable too late for shareholder reaction or credit default swap (CDS) spreads to have any\nimpact on management behavior. For example, during the financial crisis, shares in two of the\nlargest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined more than 95 percent from their prior peak\nprices and their CDS spreads went haywire.7 The ratings agencies eventually reacted, in keeping\nwith their tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. But the damage from excessive risk\ntaking had already been done. And after the crisis? Judging from the behavior of many of the\nlargest BHCs, with limited exception, efforts by shareholders of these institutions to\nmeaningfully influence management compensation practices have been slow in coming. So much\nfor shareholder discipline as a check on TBTF banks.\nUnfortunately, TBTF banks also do not face much external discipline from unsecured creditors.\nAn important facet of TBTF is that the funding sources for megabanks extend far beyond insured\n6\n\n\fdeposits, as referenced by my mention of CDS spreads. The largest banks, not just the TBTF\nbanks, fund themselves with a wide range of liabilities. These include large, negotiable CDs,\nwhich often exceed the FDIC insurance limit; federal funds purchased from other banks, all of\nwhich are uninsured, and subordinated notes and bonds, generally unsecured. It is not unusual\nfor such uninsured/unsecured liabilities to account for well over half the liabilities of TBTF\ninstitutions. If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to\ncome from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts\nperverse market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors\nrecognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured\ndepositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and\nregional banks that face the risk of failure.\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by\nthe Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government\nguarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two\nnotches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller\ncompetitors.8 Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates\nthe current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global\ninstitutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”9 To\nput that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. BHCs summed\ntogether reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nAdd to that the burdens stemming from the complexity of TBTF banks. Here is the basic\norganization diagram for a typical complex financial holding company:\n\n7\n\n\fTo simplify a complex issue, one might consider all the operations other than the commercial\nbanking operation as shadow banking affiliates, including any special investment vehicles—or\nSIVs—of the commercial bank.10\nNow, consider this table. It gives you a sense of the size and scope of some of the five largest\nBHCs, noting their nondeposit liabilities in billions of dollars and their number of total\nsubsidiaries and countries of operation (according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council):\n\nFor perspective, consider the sad case of Lehman Brothers. More than four years later, the\nLehman bankruptcy is still not completely resolved. As of its 10-K regulatory filing in 2007,\nLehman operated a mere 209 subsidiaries across only 21 countries and had total liabilities of\n$619 billion. By these metrics, Lehman was a small player compared with any of the Big Five. If\nLehman Brothers was too big for a private-sector solution while still a going concern, what can\nwe infer about the Big Five in the table?\nCorrecting for the Drawbacks of Dodd–Frank\nDodd–Frank addresses this concern. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of\nDodd–Frank, a systemically important financial institution would receive debtor-in-possession\nfinancing from the U.S. Treasury over the period its operations needed to be stabilized. This is\nquasi-nationalization, just in a new, and untested, format. In Dallas, we consider government\nownership of our financial institutions, even on a “temporary” basis, to be a clear distortion of\nour capitalist principles. Of course, an alternative would be to have another systemically\nimportant financial institution acquire the failing institution. We have been down that road\n8\n\n\falready. All it does is compound the problem, expanding the risk posed by the even larger\nsurviving behemoth organizations. In addition, perpetuating the practice of arranging shotgun\nmarriages between giants at taxpayer expense worsens the funding disadvantage faced by the\n99.8 percent remaining—small and regional banks. Merging large institutions is a form of\ndiscrimination that favors the unwieldy and dangerous TBTF banks over more focused, fit and\ndisciplined banks.\nThe approach of the Dallas Fed neither expands the reach of government nor further handicaps\nthe 99.8 percent of community and regional banks. Nor does it fight complexity with complexity.\nIt calls for reshaping TBTF banking institutions into smaller, less-complex institutions that are:\neconomically viable; profitable; competitively able to attract financial capital and talent; and of a\nsize, complexity and scope that allows both regulatory and market discipline to restrain excessive\nrisk taking.\nOur proposal is simple and easy to understand. It can be accomplished with minimal statutory\nmodification and implemented with as little government intervention as possible. It calls first for\nrolling back the federal safety net to apply only to basic, traditional commercial banking.\nSecond, it calls for clarifying, through simple, understandable disclosures, that the federal safety\nnet applies only to the commercial bank and its customers and never ever to the customers of any\nother affiliated subsidiary or the holding company. The shadow banking activities of financial\ninstitutions must not receive taxpayer support.\nWe recognize that undoing customer inertia and management habits at TBTF banking\ninstitutions may take many years. During such a period, TBTF banks could possibly sow the\nseeds for another financial crisis. For these reasons, additional action may be necessary. The\nTBTF BHCs may need to be downsized and restructured so that the safety-net-supported\ncommercial banking part of the holding company can be effectively disciplined by regulators and\nmarket forces. And there will likely have to be additional restrictions (or possibly prohibitions)\non the ability to move assets or liabilities from a shadow banking affiliate to a banking affiliate\nwithin the holding company.11\nTo illustrate how the first two points in our plan would work, I come back to the hypothetical\nstructure of a complex financial holding company. Recall that this type of holding company has a\ncommercial bank subsidiary and several subsidiaries that are not traditional commercial banks:\ninsurance, securities underwriting and brokerage, finance company and others, many with a vast\ngeographic reach.\nWhere the Government Safety Net Would Begin and End\nUnder our proposal, only the commercial bank would have access to deposit insurance provided\nby the FDIC and discount window loans provided by the Federal Reserve. These two features of\nthe safety net would explicitly, by statute, become unavailable to any shadow banking affiliate,\nspecial investment vehicle of the commercial bank or any obligations of the parent holding\ncompany. This is largely the current case—but in theory, not in practice. And consistent\nenforcement is viewed as unlikely.\n\n9\n\n\fReinforced by a New Covenant\nTo reinforce the statute and its credibility, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every\nshadow banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to agree to and\nsign a new covenant, a simple disclosure statement that acknowledges their unprotected status. A\nsample disclosure need be no more complex than this:\n\n10\n\n\fA Simple Disclaimer and Disclosure\nSample Disclosure:\n“WARNING: Conducting business with this affiliate of the _______ bank\nholding company carries NO federal deposit insurance or other federal\ngovernment protection or guarantees. I ____________, fully understand that\nin conducting business with ___________ banking affiliate, I have NO\nfederal deposit insurance or other federal government protection or\nguarantees, and my investment is totally at risk.”\n\nThis two-part step should begin to remove the implicit TBTF subsidy provided to BHCs and\ntheir shadow banking operations. Entities other than commercial banks have inappropriately\nbenefited from an implicit safety net. Our proposal promotes competition in light of market and\nregulatory discipline, replacing the status quo of subsidized and perverse incentives to take\nexcessive risk.\nAs indicated earlier, some government intervention may be necessary to accelerate the\nimposition of effective market discipline. We believe that market forces should be relied upon as\nmuch as practicable. However, entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer\ninertia, will likely only be overcome through government-sanctioned reorganization and\nrestructuring of the TBTF BHCs. A subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nThus, it appears we may need a push, using as little government intervention as possible to\nrealign incentives, reestablish a competitive landscape and level the playing field.\nWhy Protect the 0.2 Percent?\nMy team at the Dallas Fed and I are confident this simple treatment to the complex problem and\nrisks posed by TBTF institutions would be the most effective treatment. Think about it this way:\nAt present, 99.8 percent of the banking organizations in America are subject to sufficient\nregulatory or shareholder/market discipline to contain the risk of misbehavior that could threaten\nthe stability of the financial system. Zero-point-two percent are not. Their very existence\nthreatens both economic and financial stability. Furthermore, to contain that risk, regulators and\nmany small banks are tied up in regulatory and legal knots at an enormous direct cost to them\nand a large indirect cost to our economy. Zero-point-two percent. If the administration and the\nCongress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of\n11\n\n\ftaxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less\ncomplex and far more effective than Dodd–Frank.\nMaking a Time of ‘Awful Moment’ a Time of Promise\nThe time has come to change the decisionmaking paradigm. There should be more than the\npresent two solutions: bailout or the end-of-the-economic-world-as-we-have-known-it. Both\nchoices are unacceptable. The next financial crisis could cost more than two years of economic\noutput, borne by millions of U.S. taxpayers. That horrendous cost must be weighed against the\nsupposed benefits of maintaining the TBTF status quo. To us, the remedy is obvious: end TBTF\nnow. End TBTF by reintroducing market forces instead of complex rules, and in so doing, level\nthe playing field for all banking institutions.\nI return to Patrick Henry. He noted that “it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” We labor under the siren song of Dodd–Frank and the recent run-up in the\npricing of TBTF bank stocks and credit, indulging in the illusion of hope that this complex\nlegislation will end too big to fail and right the banking system. We shut our eyes to the painful\ntruth that TBTF represents an ongoing danger not just to financial stability, but also to fair\ncompetition.\nThe Dallas Fed offers a modest but, we believe, far more effective fix to Dodd–Frank. This plan\nis not without its costs. But it is less costly than all the alternatives put forward and it seriously\nreduces the likelihood of another horrendous and costly financial crisis.\nThis need not be a time of “awful moment.” It should instead be a time of promise. Treating the\npathology of TBTF now would be a big step toward a more stable and prosperous economic\nsystem, one that relies on fundamental principles of capitalism rather than regulatory complexity\nand increasing government intervention.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Two Areas of Present Concern: the Economic Outlook and the Pathology of Too-Big-to-Fail (With Reference\nto Errol Flynn, Johnny Mercer, Gary Stern and Voltaire),” speech by Richard W.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEnding ‘Too Big to Fail’:\nA Proposal for Reform Before It’s Too Late\n(With Reference to Patrick Henry, Complexity and Reality)\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to be introduced by my college classmate, John Henry. John is a descendant of the\niconic patriot, Patrick Henry. Most of John’s ancestors were prominent colonial Virginians and\nmany were anti-crown. Patrick, however, was the most outspoken. Ask John why this was so,\nand he will answer: “Patrick was poor.”\nHowever poor he may have been, Patrick Henry was a rich orator. In one of his greatest\nspeeches, he said: “Different men often see the same subject in different lights; and therefore, I\nhope that it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions\nof a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without\nreserve. This is no time for ceremony … [it] is one of awful moment to this country.”\nPatrick Henry was addressing the repression of the American colonies by the British crown.\nTonight, I wish to speak to a different kind of repression—the injustice of being held hostage to\nlarge financial institutions considered “too big to fail,” or TBTF for short.\nI submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the\nAmerican people. Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit\nthe advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.\nI have spoken of this for several years, beginning with a speech on the “Pathology of Too-Bigto-Fail” in July 2009.1 My colleague, Harvey Rosenblum—a highly respected economist and the\nDallas Fed’s director of research—and I and our staff have written about it extensively.\nTomorrow, we will issue a special report that further elucidates our proposal for dealing with the\npathology of TBTF. It also addresses the superior relative performance of community banks\nduring the recent crisis and how they are being victimized by excessive regulation that stems\nfrom responses to the sins of their behemoth counterparts. I urge all of you to read that report.2\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: I speak only for the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for others associated with our central bank. That is usually\nabundantly clear. In many matters, my staff and I entertain opinions that are very different from\nthose of many of our esteemed colleagues elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. Today, I\n“speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve” on the issue of TBTF, while meaning no\ndisrespect to others who may hold different views.\nThe Problem of TBTF\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed too big to fail were at the\nepicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of\nrisk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, we\nsubmit that they are a key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have\nfailed to adequately affect the economic recovery. Harvey Rosenblum and I first wrote about this\n1\n\n\fin an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, “The Blob That Ate\nMonetary Policy.”3 Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—\nmegabanks stopped their lending and capital market activities during the crisis and economic\nrecovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of\nthe banking system.\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very\npreamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks\nand that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run,\nparts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated weak economic growth by increasing regulatory\nuncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. It has clearly benefited many lawyers and\ncreated new layers of bureaucracy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive,\nworking against solving the core problem it seeks to address.\nDefining TBTF\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial\nfirms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the\nprocesses of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their\nactions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in\nviolation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced\nin the United States). Such firms enjoy subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They\nare thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that\nbankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted governmentsanctioned policy of coming to the aid of the owners, managers and creditors of a financial\ninstitution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could\nsubstantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from\nexcessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert\non management decisionmaking.\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal\nsafety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry\nconsolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal\ngovernment in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and\nWachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This\nreduces competition in lending.\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given its\ncomplexity, it unwittingly exacerbates them.\nComplexity Bites\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of\nEngland, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty\nremarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”4 Here are some choice passages from that noteworthy\nspeech.\n2\n\n\fHaldane notes that regulators’ “… efforts to catch the crisis Frisbee have continued to escalate.\nCasual empiricism reveals an ever-growing number of regulators … Ever-larger litters have not,\nhowever, obviously improved the watchdogs’ Frisbee-catching abilities. [After all,] no regulator\nhad the foresight to predict the financial crisis, although some have since exhibited supernatural\npowers of hindsight.\n“So what is the secret of the watchdogs’ failure? The answer is simple. Or rather, it is complexity\n… complex regulation … might not just be costly and cumbersome but sub-optimal. … In\nfinancial regulation, less may be more.”\nOne is reminded of the comment French Prime Minister Clemenceau made about President\nWilson’s 14 points: “Why 14?” he asked. “God did it in 10.”\nWere that we only had 14 points of financial regulation to contend with today. Haldane notes\nthat Dodd–Frank comes against a background of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation.\nHe points out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after\nthe formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act\nof 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the\nFederal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports\nnumbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered\n547 columns in Excel, by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he\nadds wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\nThough this growingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle\nof 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has\n16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of\nregulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done. In his speech, Haldane\nnoted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that\ncomplying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of\ncourse, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even\nmodest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He then goes on to argue the\nwick is not worth the candle. And he concludes: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too\ncomplex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That\nconfiguration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with\ncomplexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not\ncomplexity. Delivering that would require an about-turn.”\nThe Dallas Fed’s Proposal: A Reasonable ‘About-Turn’\nThe Dallas Fed’s proposal offers an “about-turn” and a way to mend the flaws in Dodd–Frank. It\nfights unnecessary complexity with simplicity where appropriate. It eliminates much of the\nmumbo-jumbo, ineffective, costly complexity of Dodd–Frank. Of note, it would be especially\nhelpful to non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or the\nfinancial system. Our proposal would relieve small banks of some unnecessary burdens arising\nfrom Dodd–Frank that unfairly penalize them. Our proposal would effectively level the playing\nfield for all banking organizations in the country and provide the best protection for taxpaying\ncitizens.\n\n3\n\n\fIn a nutshell, we recommend that TBTF financial institutions be restructured into multiple\nbusiness entities. Only the resulting downsized commercial banking operations—and not shadow\nbanking affiliates or the parent company—would benefit from the safety net of federal deposit\ninsurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nDefining the Landscape\nIt is important to have an accurate view of the landscape of banking today in order to understand\nthe impact of this proposal.\nAs of third quarter 2012, there were approximately 5,600 commercial banking organizations in\nthe U.S. The bulk of these—roughly 5,500—were community banks with assets of less than $10\nbillion. These community-focused organizations accounted for 98.6 percent of all banks but only\n12 percent of total industry assets. Another group numbering nearly 70 banking organizations—\nwith assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion—accounted for 1.2 percent of banks, while\ncontrolling 19 percent of industry assets. The remaining group, the megabanks—with assets of\nbetween $250 billion and $2.3 trillion—was made up of a mere 12 institutions. These dozen\nbehemoths accounted for roughly 0.2 percent of all banks, but they held 69 percent of industry\nassets.\n\nThe 12 institutions that presently account for 69 percent of total industry assets are candidates to\nbe considered TBTF because of the threat they could pose to the financial system and the\neconomy should one or more of them get into trouble. By contrast, should any of the other 99.8\n\n4\n\n\fpercent of banking institutions get into trouble, the matter most likely would be settled with\nprivate-sector ownership changes and minimal governmental intervention.\nHow and why does this work for 99.8 percent but not the other 0.2 percent?\nTo answer this question, it helps to consider the sources of regulatory and market discipline\nimposed on each of the three groups of banks.\nLet’s look at two dimensions of regulatory discipline: Potential closure of the institution and the\neffectiveness of supervisory pressure on bank management practices.\nDo the owners and managers of a banking institution operate with the belief that their institution\nis subject to a bankruptcy process that works reasonably quickly to transfer ownership and\ncontrol to another banking entity or entities? Is there a group of interested and involved\nshareholders that can exert a restraining force on franchise-threatening risk taking by the bank’s\ntop management team? Can management be replaced and ownership value wiped out? Is the firm\ncontrolled de facto by its owners, or instead effectively management-controlled?5 In addition, we\nask: To what extent do uninsured creditors of the banking entity impose risk-management\ndiscipline on management?\nThis analytical framework is summarized in the following slide:\n\nLooking across line 1, it is clear that community banks are subject to considerable regulatory and\nshareholder discipline. They can and do fail. In the last few years, the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. (FDIC) has built a reputation for regulators carrying out Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of\n5\n\n\f“creative destruction” by taking over small banks on a Friday evening and reopening them on\nMonday morning under new ownership. “In on Friday, out by Monday” is the mantra of this\nprocess.\nKnowing the power of banking supervisors to close the institution, owners and managers of\ncommunity banks heed supervisory suggestions to limit risk. Community banks often have a few\nsignificant shareholders who have a considerable portion of their wealth tied to the fate of the\nbank. Consequently, they exert substantial control over the behavior of management because risk\nand potential closure matter to them. Since community banks derive the bulk of their funding\nfrom federally insured deposits, they are simple rather than complex in their capital structure and\nrarely have uninsured and unsecured creditors. “Market discipline” over management practices is\nprimarily exerted through shareholders.\nOf the three groups, the 70 regional and moderate-sized banking organizations depicted in line 2\nare subject to a broader range of market discipline. Like community banks, these institutions are\nnot exempt from the bankruptcy process; they can and do fail. But given their size, complexity\nand generally larger geographic footprint, the failure resolution and ownership transfer processes\ncannot always be accomplished over a weekend. In practice, owners and managers of mid-sized\ninstitutions are nonetheless aware of the downside consequences of the risks taken by the\ninstitution. Uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors are also aware of their unprotected\nstatus in the event the institution experiences financial difficulties. Mid-sized banking institutions\nreceive a good dose of external discipline from both supervisors and market-based signals.\nTBTF megabanks, depicted in line 3, receive far too little regulatory and market discipline. This\nis unfortunate because their failure, if it were allowed, could disrupt financial markets and the\neconomy. For all intents and purposes, we believe that TBTF banks have not been allowed to fail\noutright.6 Knowing this, the management of TBTF banks can, to a large extent, choose to resist\nthe advice and guidance of their bank supervisors’ efforts to impose regulatory discipline. And\nfor TBTF banks, the forces of market discipline from shareholders and unsecured creditors are\nlimited.\nLet’s first consider discipline from shareholders. Having millions of stockholders has diluted\nshareholders’ ability to prevent the management of TBTF banks from pursuing corporate\nstrategies that are profitable for management, though not necessarily for shareholders.\nAs we learned during the crisis, adverse information on poor financial performance often is\navailable too late for shareholder reaction or credit default swap (CDS) spreads to have any\nimpact on management behavior. For example, during the financial crisis, shares in two of the\nlargest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined more than 95 percent from their prior peak\nprices and their CDS spreads went haywire.7 The ratings agencies eventually reacted, in keeping\nwith their tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. But the damage from excessive risk\ntaking had already been done. And after the crisis? Judging from the behavior of many of the\nlargest BHCs, with limited exception, efforts by shareholders of these institutions to\nmeaningfully influence management compensation practices have been slow in coming. So much\nfor shareholder discipline as a check on TBTF banks.\nUnfortunately, TBTF banks also do not face much external discipline from unsecured creditors.\nAn important facet of TBTF is that the funding sources for megabanks extend far beyond insured\n6\n\n\fdeposits, as referenced by my mention of CDS spreads. The largest banks, not just the TBTF\nbanks, fund themselves with a wide range of liabilities. These include large, negotiable CDs,\nwhich often exceed the FDIC insurance limit; federal funds purchased from other banks, all of\nwhich are uninsured, and subordinated notes and bonds, generally unsecured. It is not unusual\nfor such uninsured/unsecured liabilities to account for well over half the liabilities of TBTF\ninstitutions. If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to\ncome from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts\nperverse market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors\nrecognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured\ndepositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and\nregional banks that face the risk of failure.\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by\nthe Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government\nguarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two\nnotches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller\ncompetitors.8 Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates\nthe current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global\ninstitutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”9 To\nput that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. BHCs summed\ntogether reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\nAdd to that the burdens stemming from the complexity of TBTF banks. Here is the basic\norganization diagram for a typical complex financial holding company:\n\n7\n\n\fTo simplify a complex issue, one might consider all the operations other than the commercial\nbanking operation as shadow banking affiliates, including any special investment vehicles—or\nSIVs—of the commercial bank.10\nNow, consider this table. It gives you a sense of the size and scope of some of the five largest\nBHCs, noting their nondeposit liabilities in billions of dollars and their number of total\nsubsidiaries and countries of operation (according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council):\n\nFor perspective, consider the sad case of Lehman Brothers. More than four years later, the\nLehman bankruptcy is still not completely resolved. As of its 10-K regulatory filing in 2007,\nLehman operated a mere 209 subsidiaries across only 21 countries and had total liabilities of\n$619 billion. By these metrics, Lehman was a small player compared with any of the Big Five. If\nLehman Brothers was too big for a private-sector solution while still a going concern, what can\nwe infer about the Big Five in the table?\nCorrecting for the Drawbacks of Dodd–Frank\nDodd–Frank addresses this concern. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of\nDodd–Frank, a systemically important financial institution would receive debtor-in-possession\nfinancing from the U.S. Treasury over the period its operations needed to be stabilized. This is\nquasi-nationalization, just in a new, and untested, format. In Dallas, we consider government\nownership of our financial institutions, even on a “temporary” basis, to be a clear distortion of\nour capitalist principles. Of course, an alternative would be to have another systemically\nimportant financial institution acquire the failing institution. We have been down that road\n8\n\n\falready. All it does is compound the problem, expanding the risk posed by the even larger\nsurviving behemoth organizations. In addition, perpetuating the practice of arranging shotgun\nmarriages between giants at taxpayer expense worsens the funding disadvantage faced by the\n99.8 percent remaining—small and regional banks. Merging large institutions is a form of\ndiscrimination that favors the unwieldy and dangerous TBTF banks over more focused, fit and\ndisciplined banks.\nThe approach of the Dallas Fed neither expands the reach of government nor further handicaps\nthe 99.8 percent of community and regional banks. Nor does it fight complexity with complexity.\nIt calls for reshaping TBTF banking institutions into smaller, less-complex institutions that are:\neconomically viable; profitable; competitively able to attract financial capital and talent; and of a\nsize, complexity and scope that allows both regulatory and market discipline to restrain excessive\nrisk taking.\nOur proposal is simple and easy to understand. It can be accomplished with minimal statutory\nmodification and implemented with as little government intervention as possible. It calls first for\nrolling back the federal safety net to apply only to basic, traditional commercial banking.\nSecond, it calls for clarifying, through simple, understandable disclosures, that the federal safety\nnet applies only to the commercial bank and its customers and never ever to the customers of any\nother affiliated subsidiary or the holding company. The shadow banking activities of financial\ninstitutions must not receive taxpayer support.\nWe recognize that undoing customer inertia and management habits at TBTF banking\ninstitutions may take many years. During such a period, TBTF banks could possibly sow the\nseeds for another financial crisis. For these reasons, additional action may be necessary. The\nTBTF BHCs may need to be downsized and restructured so that the safety-net-supported\ncommercial banking part of the holding company can be effectively disciplined by regulators and\nmarket forces. And there will likely have to be additional restrictions (or possibly prohibitions)\non the ability to move assets or liabilities from a shadow banking affiliate to a banking affiliate\nwithin the holding company.11\nTo illustrate how the first two points in our plan would work, I come back to the hypothetical\nstructure of a complex financial holding company. Recall that this type of holding company has a\ncommercial bank subsidiary and several subsidiaries that are not traditional commercial banks:\ninsurance, securities underwriting and brokerage, finance company and others, many with a vast\ngeographic reach.\nWhere the Government Safety Net Would Begin and End\nUnder our proposal, only the commercial bank would have access to deposit insurance provided\nby the FDIC and discount window loans provided by the Federal Reserve. These two features of\nthe safety net would explicitly, by statute, become unavailable to any shadow banking affiliate,\nspecial investment vehicle of the commercial bank or any obligations of the parent holding\ncompany. This is largely the current case—but in theory, not in practice. And consistent\nenforcement is viewed as unlikely.\n\n9\n\n\fReinforced by a New Covenant\nTo reinforce the statute and its credibility, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every\nshadow banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to agree to and\nsign a new covenant, a simple disclosure statement that acknowledges their unprotected status. A\nsample disclosure need be no more complex than this:\n\n10\n\n\fA Simple Disclaimer and Disclosure\nSample Disclosure:\n“WARNING: Conducting business with this affiliate of the _______ bank\nholding company carries NO federal deposit insurance or other federal\ngovernment protection or guarantees. I ____________, fully understand that\nin conducting business with ___________ banking affiliate, I have NO\nfederal deposit insurance or other federal government protection or\nguarantees, and my investment is totally at risk.”\n\nThis two-part step should begin to remove the implicit TBTF subsidy provided to BHCs and\ntheir shadow banking operations. Entities other than commercial banks have inappropriately\nbenefited from an implicit safety net. Our proposal promotes competition in light of market and\nregulatory discipline, replacing the status quo of subsidized and perverse incentives to take\nexcessive risk.\nAs indicated earlier, some government intervention may be necessary to accelerate the\nimposition of effective market discipline. We believe that market forces should be relied upon as\nmuch as practicable. However, entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer\ninertia, will likely only be overcome through government-sanctioned reorganization and\nrestructuring of the TBTF BHCs. A subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away.\nThus, it appears we may need a push, using as little government intervention as possible to\nrealign incentives, reestablish a competitive landscape and level the playing field.\nWhy Protect the 0.2 Percent?\nMy team at the Dallas Fed and I are confident this simple treatment to the complex problem and\nrisks posed by TBTF institutions would be the most effective treatment. Think about it this way:\nAt present, 99.8 percent of the banking organizations in America are subject to sufficient\nregulatory or shareholder/market discipline to contain the risk of misbehavior that could threaten\nthe stability of the financial system. Zero-point-two percent are not. Their very existence\nthreatens both economic and financial stability. Furthermore, to contain that risk, regulators and\nmany small banks are tied up in regulatory and legal knots at an enormous direct cost to them\nand a large indirect cost to our economy. Zero-point-two percent. If the administration and the\nCongress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of\n11\n\n\ftaxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less\ncomplex and far more effective than Dodd–Frank.\nMaking a Time of ‘Awful Moment’ a Time of Promise\nThe time has come to change the decisionmaking paradigm. There should be more than the\npresent two solutions: bailout or the end-of-the-economic-world-as-we-have-known-it. Both\nchoices are unacceptable. The next financial crisis could cost more than two years of economic\noutput, borne by millions of U.S. taxpayers. That horrendous cost must be weighed against the\nsupposed benefits of maintaining the TBTF status quo. To us, the remedy is obvious: end TBTF\nnow. End TBTF by reintroducing market forces instead of complex rules, and in so doing, level\nthe playing field for all banking institutions.\nI return to Patrick Henry. He noted that “it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she\ntransforms us.” We labor under the siren song of Dodd–Frank and the recent run-up in the\npricing of TBTF bank stocks and credit, indulging in the illusion of hope that this complex\nlegislation will end too big to fail and right the banking system. We shut our eyes to the painful\ntruth that TBTF represents an ongoing danger not just to financial stability, but also to fair\ncompetition.\nThe Dallas Fed offers a modest but, we believe, far more effective fix to Dodd–Frank. This plan\nis not without its costs. But it is less costly than all the alternatives put forward and it seriously\nreduces the likelihood of another horrendous and costly financial crisis.\nThis need not be a time of “awful moment.” It should instead be a time of promise. Treating the\npathology of TBTF now would be a big step toward a more stable and prosperous economic\nsystem, one that relies on fundamental principles of capitalism rather than regulatory complexity\nand increasing government intervention.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee “Two Areas of Present Concern: the Economic Outlook and the Pathology of Too-Big-to-Fail (With Reference\nto Errol Flynn, Johnny Mercer, Gary Stern and Voltaire),” speech by Richard W.

            "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nExcerpts from Richard Fisher's remarks before\nthe Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce\nDecember 18, 2012 Gainesville, Texas\nWhere Is America's Middle Class? In Texas\n\nTexas continued its strong pace of economic expansion and job growth in 2012. The Dallas\nFed expects the state to post real gross domestic product growth of at least 3.5 percent and\njob growth of 3.2 percent for the year. An uninformed observer might think the jobs created\nin Texas are primarily low wage. But the attached job-growth data from Dallas Fed Senior\nEconomist Pia Orrenius show that over the past decade, Texas has led the nation in job\ncreation in all four income quartiles. We do create more low-wage jobs; we also create more\nhigh-wage jobs. And, importantly, while the growth rate for middle-income jobs over the\npast decade has been negative in the U.S., it has been positive in Texas. Middle-income jobs\nmay be declining and &quot;job polarization&quot; may be occurring in the U.S., but the\nsame is not true for Texas, where the middle-income population is expanding.\nUsing Animal Husbandry to Illustrate Problems Proposed by the Fiscal Cliff\n\nToday's Wall Street Journal notes that, according to the highly regarded analyst Ed Yardini,\nthrough September American companies bought $274 billion more shares than they issued.\nSince September, hardly a trading day goes by without a company announcing a new debt\noffering to take advantage of today's historically low interest rates to finance further share\nbuybacks and/or special dividend payouts. Too little of this money is being used to invest in\njob creation and job-creating expansion of plant and equipment in the U.S. Which raises a\nquestion about the efficacy of our accommodative monetary policy: Are our massive\npurchases of Treasury notes and bonds effective in meeting our mandate of conducting\nmonetary policy so as to create maximum employment?\nThe answer is, quantitative easing is a necessary but insufficient tool to spark job creation.\nEmployers will not deploy the cheap and abundant capital on hand toward job creation while\nthere is so much uncertainty surrounding final demand for the goods and services they sell.\nOr the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff: Until they know what their taxes will be or\nhow federal spending patterns that affect them and their customers will change (or, one\nmight add, whether the nation will have a more rational regulatory structure), they will sit on\ntheir abundant money rather than spend it on unemployment-reducing expansion.\nLet me use a little animal husbandry to illustrate this point.\nWe have a ranch in Franklin County in East Texas. We have a 2,200-pound bull there that\nbreeds our Longhorn cows. His name, incidentally, is &quot;Too Big to Fail.&quot;\n\n\fNow, Too Big has plenty of liquidity at his disposal; he's fully equipped to do what we want\nhim to do. But if we put him on the opposite side of the fence from those pretty cows, he's\nunable to perform. Think of the uncertainty I've just spoken of, and especially the uncertainty\nsurrounding the resolution of the fiscal cliff, as a fence. Businesses, just like Too Big, have\nplenty of liquidity; they have the resources they need to do what we want them to\ndo&mdash;in this case, invest in job creation. But as long as that fence of uncertainty is in\nplace, they will not be able to perform.\nThis is one of the key reasons that our political authorities must resolve how they will tax and\nspend going forward and do so in a way that incentivizes American businesses to breed more\nAmerican jobs.\n\n\fSee the full presentation for more data.\n\n\fNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W. Fisher served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from\nApril 2005 until his retirement in March 2015.\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, John [Shoven].\nI am delighted to be back on the Stanford campus, where after wandering in the cold, forbidding\npedagogical climes of Harvard and Oxford, I finally came to the student nirvana of the Stanford\nBusiness School. It was here where I was taken under the wings of intellectual giants such as Lee\nBach, Alain Enthoven, Jack McDonald, Bill Sharpe and others, whose devotion to teaching was\nequal to their scholarly accomplishments.\nI should note that, despite my having taken a degree here, the Graduate School of Business has\ngone on to be ranked first or close to first among business schools in America and the world by\nmost all who compile such metrics. Particularly important to me, in 2011 the Aspen Institute\nranked Stanford No. 1 worldwide for incorporating issues concerning social and environmental\nstewardship into its curriculum.1 Indeed, as I see it, the tradeoffs that one has to manage between\nfiscal responsibility and social and environmental stewardship are at the nexus of the potential\nand of the problems confronting the West today.\nA Tip of the Hat to George Shultz\nBefore addressing the state of the West, however, I want to say that I am humbled to have been\nasked to follow George Shultz on this program. I can’t think of any living individual—or many\nin the history of our country—who have served in as many cabinet and senior policy posts, and\nhave done so with such distinction and integrity, as George. We can all tell many stories about\nGeorge Shultz. My favorite dates to 1971, when he was director of the Office of Management\nand Budget during the Nixon administration. George had assumed the office just as federal\ngovernment outlays had for the first time in American history exceeded $200 billion, with the\ndeficit for fiscal year 1971 set to come in at a startling $23 billion, or 2.1 percent of our nation’s\ngross domestic product.\nAlarmed at this development, George called into his office the venerable Sam Cohen—a living\nencyclopedia of U.S. budgetary history—and asked, “Between you and me, Sam, is there really\nany difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?”\nCohen’s reply was classic: “Sir, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.”\nI am a central banker. I checked partisanship at the door when I joined the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Dallas seven years ago and haven’t looked back. During today’s brief comments and in the\nQ&A session that follows, I will refrain from talking about politics per se. This is despite the fact\nthat, presently, everyone and their brother wants to discuss the aftermath of the recent elections\nand speculation about who will do what to whom in addressing the fiscal cliff and the upcoming\ndebt ceiling.\n\n1\n\n\fEisenhower’s Warning\nI’ll just say this: Our Congress—past and present—has behaved disgracefully in discharging its\nfiscal duty. Its members have not shown themselves to be true born leaders. We all know it is far\npast due for our federal politicians—Democrats who may “enjoy it more” and Republicans who\nare distinguished only by that single difference—to begin acting like the responsible fiduciaries\nof the nation’s fiscal accounts they are supposed to be, rather than as the parasitic wastrels they\nhave unwittingly let themselves become.\nIn his terrific new book, Ike’s Bluff, Evan Thomas writes that in President Eisenhower’s farewell\naddress from the White House, he warned, “We cannot mortgage the material assets of our\ngrandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want\ndemocracy to survive for all generations to come.”2\nThe jig is up. Our fiscal authorities have mortgaged the material assets of our grandchildren to\nthe nth degree. We are at risk of losing our political heritage of reaching across the aisle to work\nfor the common good. In the minds of many, our government’s fiscal misfeasance threatens the\nworld’s respect for America as the beacon of democracy.\nBuzz Lightyear Monetary Policy Is Not the Answer\nOnly the Congress of the United States can now save us from fiscal perdition. The Federal\nReserve cannot. The Federal Reserve has been carrying the ball for the fiscal authorities by\nholding down interest rates in an attempt to stoke the recovery while the fiscal authorities wrestle\nthemselves off the mat. But there are limits to what a monetary authority can do. For the central\nbank also plays a fiduciary role for the American people and, given our franchise as the globe’s\npremier reserve currency, the world. We dare not become the central bank counterpart to\nCongress by adopting a Buzz Lightyear approach of “To infinity and beyond!” by endlessly\npurchasing U.S. Treasuries and agency debt so as to encumber future generations of central\nbankers with Hobson’s choices when it comes to undoing what seems contemporarily\nappropriate.\nSo my only comment today regarding the recent federal elections is this: Pray that the president\nand the Congress will at last tackle the fiscal imbroglio they and their predecessors created and\nonly they can undo. And if our nation’s authorities need to draft George Shultz back into service\nto get the job done, I am all for sending the young man back to Washington.\nThe Uncertain State of the American West\nAnd now, to address the state of the West. The invitation for this symposium notes that, “the\nAmerican West is the most dynamic region in the nation.” It goes on to posit that “The Western\nUnited States has been the source of innovation and growth and can be an engine of economic\nrecovery.” (Italics mine)\nIt is noteworthy that the latter sentence confidently refers to the past—“has been”—but is\nsomewhat conditional looking to the future, using “can be” in asserting our role as an engine of\nrecovery.\nTo understand the present West, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at some graphs and\ntrends. For the West is a many-splendored thing. Parts of it are, indeed “dynamic”; other parts\n2\n\n\fare languishing. Parts are indeed engines of growth; others are sputtering and in decline,\ndetracting from the economic recovery.\nFor the purpose of this conference, the organizers define the West as encompassing the Ninth,\nTenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Federal Reserve districts—specifically the states and territories\nwhere the Federal Reserve’s business is administered by the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas\nand San Francisco Federal Reserve banks.3\n\nFederal Reserve District Map\n\nJobs, Jobs, Jobs\n\nAs you know, when it comes to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve banks and the Board of\nGovernors labor under a dual mandate: We conduct policy with an obligation to preserve price\nstability and to engender full employment. Given that, at present, inflation and inflationary\nexpectations are tame but the nation is beset by un- and underemployment of disproportionate\nsize, I thought we might look at trends in employment in assessing just how dynamic the West\nreally is as an engine of economic prosperity. A job, after all, is the source of income and the\nroot of security and wealth for a productive people: Without income a person cannot consume\nand invest, engaging the driving engines of economic growth. Most importantly, a job is the\nroute to dignity as we have historically defined it in America.\nThe West as delineated by the four Federal Reserve Districts has indeed been the engine of\neconomic growth for the nation, as evident in this graph that charts nonagricultural employment\ngoing back 22 years:\n\n3\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 1990\n140\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n135\nWest\n\n130\n125\n\nU.S.\n120\n\nRest\n\n115\n110\n105\n100\n95\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIt is fair to say that in terms of job creation, the West is the best compared to all the rest and has\ncompensated for the underperformance of the East. As the chart shows, the rate of job creation in\nthe Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Federal Reserve districts has outpaced that of all the\nother eight Federal Reserve districts combined since 1997.\nIf you break employment growth down by Federal Reserve District, the employment dynamic\nsince 1990 looks like this:\n\n4\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 1990\n160\nDallas\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n\n150\n\nKansas City\n140\n\nMinneapolis\nAtlanta\nSan Francisco\nRichmond\nU.S.\nSt. Louis\nPhiladelphia\nChicago\nCleveland\nBoston\nNew York\n\n130\n120\n110\n100\n90\n80\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThe four Federal Reserve Districts that define the West, plus the areas covered by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond, have each outperformed the nation in job creation. Of\nnote to those who might later read this speech in Gotham and remain devotees of the perspective\ncaptured by Saul Steinberg’s iconic “View of the World from Ninth Avenue” cover of The New\nYorker, this graph does not present a happy picture: Total employment growth in the Empire\nState over the 22-year period has been 6 percent, a compound annual growth rate of 0.26 percent,\none-eighth that of Texas over the same period.\nNote the Disparities, However\nIf you zoom in on the employment dynamics that have ensued with the onset of the financial\ncrisis, you begin to see important disparities in employment growth within the West.\n\n5\n\n\fEmployment Since the Beginning of\nthe Recession\n104\nDallas\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 2008\n102\n\nMinneapolis\n\n100\n\nNew York\nKansas City\n98\n\nRichmond\nPhiladelphia\nBoston\nU.S.\nCleveland\nSt. Louis\nChicago\n\n96\n\n94\n\nSan Francisco\n92\n\nAtlanta\n\n90\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s district is the only one to have punched through employment levels that\nprevailed at the end of 2007. The Minneapolis and Kansas City districts rank second and fourth\nin post-recession performance, while employment within the San Francisco Federal Reserve\nDistrict has failed to recover with the same vigor.\nA more revealing divergence is evident when you go back to 1990 and plot employment growth\nof individual states, rather than Federal Reserve districts. For illustrative purposes, and because\nthey bear a disproportionate weight, covering almost 30 percent of the nation’s population and\nover 75 percent of the West’s, I am going to focus on the specifics of the Eleventh and Twelfth\nFederal Reserve districts—the areas covered by the Dallas Fed and the San Francisco Fed.\nThe Eleventh District covers 27 million people living in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern\nNew Mexico. Over 96 percent of the output of the Dallas Federal Reserve District is produced by\nthe 26 million people of one state, Texas. By contrast, California accounts for 61 percent of the\nSan Francisco Fed’s district output and 37 million souls, or roughly 58 percent of the district’s\nestimated population of 64 million. The remainder of the district’s output and population is\nspread across eight states: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and\nWashington (plus three Pacific territories).\nOver the past 22 years, Texas has grown employment at an average annual rate of 2 percent. It\nhas been bettered by Nevada at an average annual growth rate of 2.8 percent, Utah at 2.6 percent,\nArizona at 2.4 percent and Idaho at 2.3 percent. Alaska has compounded job creation at 1.6\npercent, Washington at 1.4 percent and Oregon at 1.2 percent. And California? California has\nexperienced an average annual employment growth of 0.64 percent (zero-point-six-four percent).\nIt has bettered New York, but that is nothing to write home about except as a tale of woe.\n\n6\n\n\fMost recently, from the onset of the recession of 2008 to present, only one state in the Twelfth\nDistrict has returned to prerecession employment levels: Alaska. The only other Western states\nto punch through prerecession employment levels have been North Dakota (in the Minneapolis\nFed’s district) and … Texas. One might quickly deduce that these states all share a common\ncharacteristic: They are all big oil and gas producers. But as we shall see, while this certainly\nhelps, it is only part of the picture as regards Texas.\n\nEmployment Remains Below\nPre-Crisis Peaks in Most Western States\n120\nPercentage of Pre-Recession Peak Employment\n115\nNorth Dakota\n110\n105\nTexas\nAlaska\n\n100\n\nUtah\nWashington\nOregon\n\n95\n\nCalifornia\nArizona\n\n90\n\nNevada\n\n85\n80\nPeak=t t+6 mo.\n\nt+12\n\nt+18\n\nt+24\n\nt+30\n\nt+36\n\nt+42\n\nt+48\n\nt+54\n\nt+60\n\nt+66\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nComparing Texas and California\nI am going to narrow this down a little to focus specifically on Texas and California, the\nmegastates of the West.\n\n7\n\n\fTotal Nonagricultural Employment\nSince 1990\n160\n\nTexas\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n150\n140\n130\n\nU.S.\n120\n\nCalifornia\n\n110\n100\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nI think it fair to say that, as regards job creation, Texas has been “dynamic,” per this conference’s\nflyer. A better descriptive word starting with ‘dy’ for California would be “dysphoric,” an\nadjective derived from dysphoros, classical Greek for “hard to bear” and more commonly\ntranslated into English to describe “a state of feeling unwell or unhappy,” according to Webster’s\nNinth New Collegiate Dictionary.\nA snapshot of the unhappy state of affairs in California is provided by a much discussed metric:\nthe percentages of homes that remain “underwater,” as shown by this graph comparing\nCalifornia with the rest of the U.S. and Texas.\n\n8\n\n\fUnderwater Mortgages\n40\n35\n\n2009 Q4\n\n35.1\n\n2012 Q2\n30\n\n29\n23.8\n\n25\n\n22.3\n\n20\n15\n11.9\n8.8\n\n10\n5\n0\nCalifornia\n\nU.S.\n\nTexas\n\nNOTE: Percent of homes with a balance greater than home value.\nSOURCE: Corelogic.\n\nThere are many other economic indicators that illustrate the dire economic condition of\nCalifornia and the more felicitous economy of Texas. You all know what they are; I won’t dwell\non them for fear of being pelted by bread rolls or worse at this pleasant luncheon.\nThe question is: Why? Why has the Golden State lost its luster and become a place where the\neconomic burdens of its people have become hard to bear, when once it was the very exemplar of\nhappy, hearty dynamism that is the West? How could it be that the hardscrabble Lone Star State\nhas come to replace California as the engine of the West’s economic growth?\nDon’t Blame the Fed…\nThere are many reasons, to be sure. But one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that\nCalifornia’s underperformance has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve. After all, Texas\nworks with the same monetary policy as California and the other states of the union. Texans pay\nthe same interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans; they\nwork under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and\noperate with the same stock market as the rest of the nation.\n…and Don’t Attribute It Just to Oil\nNor can Texas’ relative outperformance be attributed, as it stereotypically is, to oil and gas. To\nbe sure, Texas produces more oil than Norway and more natural gas than Canada. But here is the\ndirty little secret: Like California, Texas has a widely diversified economy. As the following\nchart of where jobs have been created thus far in 2012 demonstrates, Texas is diversified more\nthan most people think. The oil and gas and mining sector accounts for only 2.4 percent of its\nemployment and produces approximately 8 percent of the state’s tax revenue. Utilizing the latest\ntechnology to develop new oil and gas and gas liquid fields, the energy sector has created over\n14,000 jobs in Texas thus far in 2012. But professional and business services have created\n62,100; trade, transportation and utilities—47,800; educational and health services—36,000;\n9\n\n\fleisure and hospitality—33,000; construction—23,000; and even the government has created\nmore than the oil and gas sector, with 14,200 jobs. All in, the non-energy sectors of the economy\nhave created nearly 640,000 jobs since the recovery began in Texas in November 2009.\n\n2012 Employment Growth in Texas\nTotal Number of Jobs Created in 2012 = 264,100\n(YTD growth through September 2012)\n\nThousands of jobs\n70\n\n62.1\n60\n50\n\n47.8\n\n40\n\n35.9\n32.6\n\n30\n22.6\n20\n\n14.9\n\n14.2\n\n14.1\n8.0\n\n10\n\n0.4\n0\nEducational &\nProf. &\nLeisure &\nTrade, Transp Government Health Services\nBusiness\nHospitality\n(16.5%)\n& Utilities\n(13.5%)\nServices (13.1%) (10.0%)\n(20.0%)\n\nOil & Gas\nManufacturing Financial Construction Extraction and Information\nMining Support\nActivities\n(5.4%)\n(1.8%)\n(7.9%)\n(2.4%)\n(6.0%)\n\nNOTE: NAICS Super Sectors, SA by FRB Dallas.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nTrue, Texas lags California and most other states in social services. We are the antithesis of the\nwelfare state. And yet, we are the indisputable leader of job creation in the nation, outpacing the\nUnited States by a factor of more than 2-to-1 over two decades. We draw massive inflows of\nbusiness investment, and we attract significant numbers of immigrants from within the United\nStates, even more so than we draw in from across the border and abroad.\nAll My Exes Live in Texas\nLook at these charts of net migration for California and Texas (I have thrown in New York for\nadded measure):\n\n10\n\n\fCalifornia Net Migration\nNet Migration (in thousands)\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n-200\n-300\n\nDomestic\n\n-400\n\nInternational\n\n-500\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\nNOTE: Data for Census years (2000, 2010) are not available.\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nNew York Net Migration\nNet Migration (in thousands)\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\n-200\nDomestic\n\n-250\n\nInternational\n-300\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\nNOTE: Data for Census years (2000, 2010) are not available.\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n11\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n\fTexas Net Migration\nNet Migration (in thousands)\n400\n350\nDomestic\n300\n\nInternational\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\nNOTE: Data for Census years (2000, 2010) are not available.\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nYes, Texas has a low propensity of social services, and employment growth should not be the\nonly criterion for evaluating a state’s performance. But we must remember that economic growth\nis the foundation for the other goals and aspirations a society may have. You cannot pay for\nsocial services unless you have the tax revenue to do so. You cannot have tax revenue unless you\nhave sources from whom to collect it. And the best revenue source of all is a citizenry that is\nfully employed and an economy that is prosperous. Moreover, we must not forget that a job is\ncritical to a sense of self-worth, dignity and pride.\nAs these previous charts indicate, Texas is a leader in creating jobs. If you believe people vote\nwith their feet, the balance Texas has struck between job creation and social services seems\nappropriate enough to attract the diaspora of the other megastates.\nThe great country western singer George Strait appears to have summed it all up with his iconic\ntune “All My Exes Live in Texas”: ex-businesses, ex-workers and ex-taxpayers seem to be\njoining his many ex-wives in migrating to our part of the West.\nAdam and Eve\nTo be sure, Texas is hardly a paradise. We have plenty of natural beauty, but nothing we have\ncan compare to the magnificence of California’s beaches and ocean vistas, mountains, redwood\nforests, and rich and plentiful ecosystems. We are admittedly miserly with our social welfare\nprograms. We fall short in many other social metrics. And yet for the West—beyond Texas and\nthe job-creating states in the Ninth and Tenth Federal Reserve districts—to remain the source of\ninnovation and growth and economic prosperity that it has been, California will have to achieve\nthe kind of balance between social and environmental responsibility and the capacity to provide\nfor a prosperous economy that is taught at the Graduate School of Business here at Stanford.\n\n12\n\n\fRight now, that balance seems to have been lost. It is costing California jobs and people and is\ndepleting its revenue coffers. We shall see if the new tax increase levied by popular acclaim on\ntop of already highly taxed and heavily regulated business operators will improve or exacerbate\nthat imbalance.\nI have my concerns. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently released a paper titled\n“Assessing State Business Climate Indexes.”4 It confirms what you needn’t have a Stanford\neducation to conclude: “Economies of states ranked high on the tax-and-cost indexes”—meaning\nlower taxes and costs of doing business—“tended to grow faster than the states ranked [poorly]\non these indexes.” Of course, one need only look out the window here to see that a pretty\nattractive quality of life abounds in slow-growing, high-tax and expensive California. But the\nquestion is: How long can a high quality of life be maintained if too few jobs are being created\nand people and businesses, taxpayers all, are fleeing to other states?\nAs much as I respect the San Francisco Fed’s research department, I think the cartoonists at The\nNew Yorker have said it best. This gem appeared in a recent edition and sums it all up:\n\n“I don’t like to complain,” says Adam, “but he should’ve created some jobs, too.”\nSurely, the West would be better off with a strong, job-creating Texas and a strong, job-creating\nCalifornia, just as it has strong, job-creating economies in many if not all of the states of the\nNinth and Tenth Federal Reserve districts and some parts of the Twelfth. I am hoping this\nconference will zero in on how this can be accomplished, for the West can only be as strong as\nour weakest link—and we can ill afford to have California remain so.\n13\n\n\fThank you. Now, in the great tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering\nany questions you might have.\nNotes\n1\nSee www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/rankings.\n2\nSee Ike’s Bluff: President Eisenhower’s Secret Battle to Save the World, by Evan Thomas, New\nYork: Little, Brown and Co., September 2012, p. 4.\n3\nThe organizers of the conference are the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\n(SIEPR) and the Bill Lane Center for the American West.\n4\n“Assessing State Business Climate Indexes,” by David Neumark, Jed Kolko and Marisol\nCuellar Mejia, FRBSF Economic Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Sept. 4, 2012.\n\n14\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 10, 2012\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe United States Is Not Europe and Texas Ain’t France:\nAmerica as the Thoroughbred Economy\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Michael [Tanner].\nYou and your colleagues have had a long day. So far today, you’ve had 21 speakers and panelists\naddressing Europe’s crisis and lessons for the United States. Being the Cato Institute, devoted as\nyou are to advocating for “free, open and civil societies” based on “the principles of limited\ngovernment, free markets, individual liberty and peace,” the conference has done a pretty\nthorough job of highlighting how the financial burden of the American welfare apparatus—\nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other entitlements that encumber our nation’s balance\nsheet—must be resolved if we are to avoid arriving at the same destination as Europe.\nIt would take a strong person to spend an entire day listening to the tales of cautionary woe about\nEurope’s pathology so near to our dysfunctional Capitol and resist the urge to rush home and slit\nhis wrists. I am going to try to end today’s discussion on a more pleasant plane, acknowledging\nour problems here, yet pointing to some factors that give me hope. I will spend little time talking\nabout monetary policy. After I am done with these comments, I’ll be happy to avoid answering\nany questions you might have on that front.\nIt is a sad day when the Financial Times opens its Monday edition with the first sentence of its\nlead article declaring, “The U.S. is the brightest spot in the world economy,” then qualifies the\ncomment by pointing out that we shine only within a global economy that is “on the ropes.”1\nThis was followed yesterday by a Wall Street Journal report from Tokyo under a banner\nheadline—“Global Recession Risk Rises.” The article says, “The IMF upgraded growth\nprospects for only one major nation compared with its July forecast. It projected that the U.S.\nwould grow 2.2 percent this year, 0.1 percentage point”—zero point one—“higher than\npreviously estimated.”2 One is tempted to conclude, as I have remarked on many occasions, that\nwe are but the “best-looking horse in the glue factory” of hapless economies.\nI have a preferred equine analogy for the American economy. It looks like this:\n\n1\n\n\fIt is of the Triple Crown winner, Secretariat, a chestnut thoroughbred with a strong, muscular\nphysique, leading the pack by a record-breaking 31 lengths at the Belmont Stakes for a victory\nthat would shock the world. I am convinced that with proper care and feeding, American\nbusinesses can pace us to win the equivalent of the Triple Crown of the global economy. And I\nbelieve we have laboratories within our own borders, such as Texas, that provide us with\nexamples of how Congress might help businesses do so and help our nation avoid the European\ntrap.\nIf we can liberate the private sector from the shackles of uncertainty about fiscal policy and\noverregulation and take the best from states that have succeeded in attracting job-creating\nbusinesses, I am convinced that, like Secretariat at Belmont, the United States can win the\nlongest of races by an astonishing margin. And in doing so, we can show the way for others.\nHow might this be done? What is holding us back?\nIt helps to retrace a little recent history.\nOn this 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, it is important to remember that we won.\nWe won the Cold War. We spent a generation of blood and treasure to move from the constant\nthreat of mutually assured destruction to mutually assured competition. As we did in the\naftermath of many of our nation’s great struggles—World War I and World War II—we emerged\nfrom a titanic struggle with the Soviet Union as the victor and world leader. We not only\nliberated Eastern Europe when the Berlin Wall came down, but also incentivized the forces of\neconomic reform in China, Vietnam, India and elsewhere. We got exactly what we fought for: A\nworld economy expanded by billions of new consumers and producers of goods and services\nrather than weapons of war.\n\n2\n\n\fWhat followed the fall of the Soviet threat was an opening up of the world economy, aided by\ntrade liberalization championed by two presidents—a Republican named George H.W. Bush, and\na Democrat, Bill Clinton—who together shaped and delivered the Uruguay Round, the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and myriad other arrangements\nto allow for the freer flow of goods, communications and capital. This is worth remembering:\nUnder both Republican and Democratic leadership, we did what was economically sensible.\nThe result was a long-lived expansion. But it ended in tears. Success led to complacency;\ncomplacency led to a tolerance and even encouragement of excess. We spent more than we could\nafford; our government—Republicans and Democrats alike—continued, at an accelerated pace,\ndown the path of promising more in social programs and other spending programs than we could\nsustain. And on the regulatory front, we turned a collective blind eye to economic malpractice,\nresulting in the spectacular failure of Enron and culminating with the collapse of megabanks for\nwhich even a cursory glance at their balance sheets would have revealed, in the words of one of\nmy colleagues, “nothing on the right was right and nothing on the left was left.” What started out\nas a widely heralded period of Great Moderation and seemingly endless growth metastasized into\na cancer of excess and speculation, resulting in a crash from which we are now only slowly—\nvery, very slowly—recovering.\nThe wreckage and its aftermath have been widely discussed and analyzed in countless fora and\npublications. This afternoon, I want to quickly highlight some key outcomes that are often\noverlooked.\nFirst among them is that American businesses have emerged from the crisis revamped and hyperefficient. When producers of goods and services cannot price what goes out the door as richly as\nthe cost of what comes in the door, as was beginning to occur in the summer of 2008, or when\ndemand for one’s product collapses, as happened post-Lehman, and firms can’t grow their top\nline—they batten down the hatches, looking to preserve their margins by cutting costs and\nramping up productivity. Over the past four-plus years, U.S. businesses have cut operating costs\nto the bone. They have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made possible by the\nFederal Reserve to rejigger their balance sheets, exploiting the lower cost of debt and the Feddriven bull market for stocks. American businesses—large and small, public and private—have\ndone this with an alacrity that has dismantled the momentary notion that the European business\nmodel was superior, or that the Chinese adaptation of economic management was somehow\nbetter suited for a globalized economy. The private sector in the United States has adjusted to the\nnew world faster than you can say, “Japan is No. 1.” American business is now more fit to\ncompete than ever before.\nSecond, despite a lot of fire breathing and beating of the breast, our government has for the most\npart preserved the open-trade environment fashioned under our 41st and 42nd presidents.\nProtectionism has been held at bay. Our businesses have the entire world to source from and sell\nto. They also have the option to invest in job-creating ventures in more places than ever before,\nan option necessitating that our government reboot tax policy if it wishes for American\nbusinesses to invest in job creation at home.\nThird, we have more than enough fuel in reserve to finance a prolonged period of job creation\nand economic expansion. The Fed has $1.4 trillion in excess private bank reserves on deposit at\nthe 12 Federal Reserve Banks; there are additional cash resources lying fallow in nondepository\n3\n\n\ffinancial enterprises; there is an additional $2 trillion or so of cash or cash-equivalent assets\nsitting on the sidelines in the coffers of businesses, above and beyond their operating needs and\npresent plans for capital expenditure (capex). The cost of money is nil. Interest rates for\ncreditworthy businesses are the lowest in the history of the republic. Hawks like me worry that\nour central bank has done far more than what was required and are concerned about the\ndifficulties we will encounter when we need to tighten policy and exit from über-easy monetary\npolicy. But this much I know: Presently, American businesses—big and small, public and\nprivate—have money burning a hole in their pockets. They have the financial wherewithal to\nexpand and hire.\nSo here we are: American businesses are muscular and fit, rich and ready to roll. Now, what do\nwe need to induce them to hire and put the American people back to work in order to restore\neconomic growth and prosperity?\nObviously, we need to have demand to sell into. One does not need to read the Financial Times\nor the Wall Street Journal to know that the global economy has slowed and that exports will not\ndrive U.S. final demand for the foreseeable future. At home, our government is drowning in debt\nand is hyper-leveraged. The cost of its debt burden is being mitigated by accommodative\nmonetary policy, but our federal government has reached its limit as a direct source of aggregate\ndemand or investment impetus. Even if we wanted to, we cannot look to government to propel\nthe economy forward. This leaves domestic consumption and investment by the private sector as\nthe best hope for us to remain “the brightest spot in the world economy.”\nBut, as any student of elementary economics knows, you can’t grow consumption unless you\ngrow income. You can’t grow income unless you put the American people back to work. And\nyou can’t put the people back to work unless businesses invest and expand their payrolls. But\nhere is the rub: You can’t expect businesses to expand payrolls or job-creating capex unless they\ndecide to use the abundant cash and cheap credit they have ready access to; they will not invest if\nthey are totally uncertain about the return they might earn on that investment.\nThe first thing an aspiring MBA candidate or any entrepreneur learns is that business is the art of\ndecisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty. Businesses can manage around a reasonable\namount of uncertainty. But under conditions of total uncertainty, they cannot make the kinds of\nstrategic decisions that result in significant expansion.\nAmerican businesses face the uncertainty of the European miasma much discussed here today.\nAnd they are increasingly uncertain about the once “sure thing” of China as a source of\nseemingly endless future demand. The slowing globalized economy—a “world economy on the\nropes”—is without a doubt a great source of uncertainty and a retardant to job creation and\nexpansion. But I would argue that nimble business operators can manage that risk. What they\ncannot manage is the mordant fiscal predicament hanging over their heads. A feckless American\ngovernment—specifically, a Congress that hasn’t created a budget for more than three years—is\npoised to drive us off the so-called fiscal cliff. It has contrived a tax code and regulatory structure\nthat would baffle a financial Houdini, has compounded the uncertainty facing businesses to a\nstifling degree. At present, no business—big or small, public or private—knows what its tax\nrates will be going forward. No business knows the social overhead needed to cover their\nemployees. No business knows the degree to which federal spending programs will be changed\nor truncated, and how that will impact it or its customer base.\n4\n\n\fWithout some certainty about your cost factors or reasonable understanding of the prospects for\ndemand for your products, you go into a defensive crouch. You can’t budget; you can’t plan.\nYou can’t run the risk of hiring and expanding beyond your replacement needs. Uncertainty of\nthe kind I have just described cripples job creation, capital investment and the ability of\nbusinesses to realize their potential.\nHere is a direct quote from the October survey of 691 small and medium-sized businesses by the\nNational Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), released just yesterday:\n“Uncertainty appears to dominate the outlook. … Spending and hiring are on hold … owners are\nin maintenance mode. ... Record numbers of consumers feel that the government is doing a poor\njob [per the University of Michigan survey] and record numbers of small-business owners report\nthe political climate as a reason not to expand.” The text of the release goes on to say, “Only 8\npercent [of those surveyed] complained that they didn’t get all the credit they wanted. Two\npercent say credit is their top business problem compared to 21 percent each citing taxes,\nregulations and red tape, and poor sales.”3\nWith regard to job-creating capital expenditures, two recent studies are worth contemplating. The\nfirst is a survey of CFOs conducted last month—before the last meeting of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee—by Duke University’s Fuqua School. Of the 887 CFOs surveyed, only 14.5\npercent listed “credit markets/interest rates” as among the top three concerns facing their\ncorporations, with 84 percent saying they would not change their investment plans if interest\nrates dropped by 2 percent. In contrast, 43 percent listed consumer demand among their top three\nconcerns, while 41 percent cited federal government policies.4\nThe second was a study conducted earlier in the year by Professors Michael Porter and Jan\nRivkin, surveying nearly 10,000 Harvard Business School alumni, with a special focus on 1,700\nrespondents who were “personally involved in decisions about whether to place business\nactivities and jobs in the U.S. or elsewhere.” Here is a pie chart from the study, summarizing the\nmost commonly mentioned impediments to investing and creating jobs in the U.S.\n\n5\n\n\fNote the slices with asterisks, signifying that uncertainty is a theme within the categories of\ntaxes, macroeconomics, regulations and health care. And note this direct quote from the report:\n“We asked an open-ended question: What are the greatest impediments to investing and creating\njobs in the United States? … In the realm of taxes … respondents were deterred from investing\nin the United States not simply by a high statutory corporate tax rate, but also by the sheer\ncomplexity and uncertain future of the tax code. Similarly, with respect to regulations,\nrespondents identified uncertainty as a barrier nearly as often as they pointed to regulatory\nburden and they highlighted the bureaucratic complexity commonly associated with compliance\nand permitting.”5\nI did not see any direct reference in the text of Porter and Rivkin’s study to monetary policy as\nan inhibitor of investment plans.\nIf 42 percent of the NFIB’s businesses and 41 percent of those surveyed by Duke University cite\nfederal government policies and red tape as their biggest inhibitor to job-creating expansion; if\nPorter and Rivkin’s work makes clear that uncertainty and complexity about taxes and regulation\nare deterrents to investing in the U.S.; if small and medium and large businesses feel they have\nsufficient financial access or wherewithal to conduct their affairs, then I don’t think it takes a\ngenius to conclude what needs fixing if we are to treat the problem of unemployment and anemic\neconomic growth in this country.\nThe fix lies not within the purview of the Federal Reserve. The fix lies solely in the hands of a\ngovernment that has the power to shape taxes and spending programs to incent businesses to go\nout and hire rather than ball up into a defensive crouch, or worse, go elsewhere in the world that\nwe worked so hard to liberate, to create jobs for others rather than for our own people.\n\n6\n\n\fThe private sector and American business community are poised to expand. But they will not do\nso as long as we have a government that cannot resist the temptation to devise a politically\nconvenient patchwork instead of laying out a convincing, reliable, long-term program that job\ncreators and consumers can count on and plan around.\nThis is a point that I believe is widely neglected. Short-term fixes to our fiscal and regulatory\npathology will not solve the problem of unemployment and economic sluggishness. The great\ninhibitor of job creation is the uncertainty over taxes and spending and regulation that plagues\nbusinesses. Even if businesses do not like the rules that govern their behavior, knowing those\nrules with certainty gives them something to plan around and navigate through. Presently, they\nhaven’t the foggiest idea what the rules will be.\nThere are many macroeconomists and politicians who look at the fiscal cliff and, worried that\ninaction will plunge us into recession by both raising taxes and dramatically cutting spending,\nsuggest that one-year or other short-term fixes will stave off recession. That is true from a\nmacroeconomic standpoint; I have no quarrel with this logic. But it will come at a cost: Shortterm fixes only push out the envelope of uncertainty. If the fix is for nine months or one year,\nthen businesses will wait for nine months or a year before making major commitments to hire or\ninvest. We might heave a collective sigh of relief that we did not drive off the cliff, but to job\ncreators, this is just another reason to stall until a long-term, dependable resolution is crafted. A\nfar better outcome will be for fiscal authorities to provide a convincing, long-term solution to our\nfiscal woes. Until then, our economy will perform well below capacity. We may outpace our\nhapless friends in Europe or elsewhere—we may remain the best-looking horse in the glue\nfactory—but we will not realize our thoroughbred potential.\nLuckily, we have some examples of success in the American economic laboratory. I live within\none: Texas. Here is a graph charting 22 years of job creation in Texas versus the other large\nstates and the United States as a whole.\n\n7\n\n\fThink about it: Texas works with the same monetary policy as the other 49 states do. We pay the\nsame interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans; we work\nunder the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and operate\nwith the same stock market as the rest of the nation. To be sure, we have some natural\nadvantages: We produce more oil than Norway and more natural gas than Canada. But here is\nthe dirty little secret: Like the United States, we are a diversified economy. As this chart of\nwhere jobs were created in 2011 demonstrates, Texas is diversified pretty much along the lines\nof the United States. The oil and gas and mining sector accounts for only 2.3 percent of our\nemployment. The sector created over 37,000 jobs in 2011, but the trade, transportation and\nutilities; professional and business services; and educational and health services sectors created\nmore.\n\n8\n\n\fWorking under the same federal fiscal and monetary policy as the rest of the United States,\nTexas has created over 50 percent more jobs than it had in 1990, whereas New York has\nexpanded its nonfarm employment by a paltry 6 percent, Illinois by 8 percent and California by\n14 percent.\nTrue, we lag the other states shown on this chart in social services. We are the antithesis of the\nwelfare state. And yet we are the indisputable leader of job creation in the nation, outpacing the\nUnited States by 2.5 to 1 over two decades. We draw massive inflows of business investment,\nand we attract significant numbers of immigrants from within the United States and from abroad.\nLook at this chart of immigrant flows for Texas.\n\n9\n\n\fAnd now compare it with these charts of flows for California, New York and Illinois.\n\n10\n\n\fYes, we have a low propensity of social services. But we excel at creating the single most\nimportant driver of human dignity and pride: jobs. If you believe people vote with their feet, the\nbalance we have struck between job creation and social services seems appropriate enough to\nattract the diaspora of the other megastates. We must be doing something right in Texas.\n\n11\n\n\fThe 22-year time span of the spaghetti graph I showed earlier covers legislatures that, under both\nDemocratic and Republican leadership and Democratic and Republican governors, have created\na pro-business, pro-growth environment. I would suggest that if you want to see an economy that\nhas avoided the traps of an overburdened social structure like that which you have discussed\ntoday, and if you want to consider a fiscal and regulatory regime that attracts rather than chases\naway business and jobs, you might look to Texas.\nYou might then compare it to California, which has the opposite approach and is paying a price\nfor it.\nA friend of mine from Los Angeles recently encapsulated the difference between California and\nTexas in a short story that you Cato-ites might find amusing:\n“The governor of California is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and\nattacks the governor’s dog, then bites the governor. The governor starts to intervene, but reflects\nupon the movie Bambi and then realizes he should stop because the coyote is only doing what is\nnatural.\n“He calls animal control. Animal control captures the coyote and bills the state $200 for testing it\nfor diseases and $500 for relocating it. He calls a veterinarian. The vet collects the dead dog and\nbills the state $200 for testing it for diseases. The governor goes to the hospital and spends\n$3,500 getting checked for diseases from the coyote and getting his bite wound bandaged.\n“The running trail gets shut down for six months while the California Fish and Game\nDepartment conducts a $100,000 survey to make sure the area is now free of dangerous animals.\nThe governor spends $50,000 in state funds implementing a ‘coyote awareness program’ for\nresidents of the area. The Legislature spends $2 million to study how to better treat rabies and\nhow to permanently eradicate the disease throughout the world.\n“The governor’s security agent is fired for not stopping the attack. The state spends $150,000 to\nhire and train a new agent with additional special training, re: the nature of coyotes. People for\nthe Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protests the coyote’s relocation and files a $5 million\nsuit against the state.\n“The governor of Texas is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and tries\nto attack him and his dog. The governor shoots the coyote with his state-issued pistol and keeps\njogging.\n“The governor spent 50 cents on a .380-caliber, hollow-point cartridge. Buzzards ate the dead\ncoyote.\n“And that, my friends, is why California is broke and Texas is not.”\nWe don’t have to follow the path of California. Or that of Europe. Texas has no monopoly on\ngood government. It is but an example, however imperfect, of what I believe Cato holds dear in\nits vision for an operating economy. And if the United States Congress would look to it and other\nstates that have found the secret to unleashing the best of the animal spirits of the marketplace,\nthere is no question in my mind that America can outshine the rest of the world and lead it back\n12\n\n\fto economic growth and expanding prosperity. To unlock that brighter future, Congress must set\naside its partisan bickering and short-term political myopia and get down to crafting a tax,\nspending and regulatory regime that not only reins in deficit spending and runaway unfunded\nliabilities, but also focuses on incentivizing America’s businesses to create jobs. If they do, we\nwill end up like Secretariat at Belmont, winning the race for prosperity by 31 lengths or more.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\n“U.S. Defies Threat of Global Recession,” by Chris Giles, Financial Times, Oct. 8, 2012.\n“Global Recession Risk Rises,” by Sudeep Reddy and Bob Davis, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 9, 2012.\n3\nSee Small Business Economic Trends survey, National Federation of Independent Business, October 2012,\nwww.nfib.com/research-foundation/surveys/small-business-economic-trends.\n4\nSee Duke University/CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey, Duke University’s Fuqua School of\nBusiness, www.cfosurvey.org.\n5\n“Prosperity at Risk: Findings of Harvard Business School’s Survey on U.S. Competitiveness,” by Michael E.\nPorter and Jan W.

Fisher\nThank you, Nicole [Parent]. And thanks to the Harvard Club of New York for including me in\nyour speaker series. It is quite something to see one’s picture on the cover of the Harvard Club of\nNew York Bulletin wedged between that of Tommy Tune and Nina Khrushcheva, Nikita\nKhrushchev’s great-granddaughter.\nMy wife Nancy and I celebrated our 39th anniversary on Sept. 8. Knowing that she has seen and\nloved everything our fellow Texan Tommy Tune has ever done on the musical stage, and having\ngrown up with the image of Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the\nSoviet Union banging his shoe on the podium of the United Nations and saying, “We will bury\nyou!” I thought I would impress her that evening by showing her the Bulletin. “In your wildest\ndreams,” I asked her, “did you ever think that the skinny, long-haired boy you married 39 years\nago would be headlining a speaker series alongside Tommy Tune and Nikita Khrushchev’s\ngreat-granddaughter?” Her answer was classic: “Richard, we have been married for four decades.\nI hate to disappoint you sweetheart, but you don’t appear in my wildest dreams.”\nA Word About Nicole Parent\nI am here to speak to you about monetary policy. But before I start, I am going to take advantage\nof your undivided attention to announce to all assembled here tonight that the former president of\nthis club and my fellow Harvard Overseer, Nicole Parent, is engaged to be married. Nicole, may\nyour marriage last at least 39 years and may you be blessed with the wildest of dreams and the\nbest of life.\nA Different Perspective\nIn addition to the Algonquin, there are two iconic buildings on this side of West 44th Street. One\nis the New York Yacht Club; the other is the Harvard Club. I mention this because the close\nproximity of these two buildings suggests something of a biographical metaphor. I spent four\nyears at a Naval Academy prep school before becoming a midshipman in 1967 at Annapolis,\nwhere I majored in engineering and learned the craft of seamanship and naval warfare. Then, in\n1969, Harvard kindly recruited me in as a transfer student. Two years later, I graduated with a\ndegree in economics.\nIn thinking through many of the policy issues that confront me as a member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), I tend to combine both backgrounds, as well as an orientation\nframed by having an MBA and spending a significant portion of my career as a banker and\nmarket operator. My perspective is thus framed from the viewpoint of an engineer, an MBA and\na former market operator—not as a PhD economist. For most economic theoreticians, hundreds\nof billions, or even trillions, of dollars are inputs into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium\nmodel and other econometric equations. To a banker, businessperson or market operator, these\nare real dollars that have to be thought of within the framework of a transmission mechanism that\nneeds to get the money from its origin at the Fed into the real economy with maximum efficacy.\nMy focus tends toward the practicable—how to harness theory to devise a workable solution to\n1\n\n\fthe problems that confront a central banker. There are many superb PhD theorists among the 19\nmembers of the FOMC and support staff. There are only a handful of us—four, to be exact—\nwho have worked as bankers or in the financial markets.\nTonight, I am going to provide my take on the FOMC’s most recent decision to embark on a new\nround of quantitative easing focused on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Given my\nbackground, and the fact that the Navy is once again welcome back in Harvard Yard, I’ll ask\nyour forbearance if I use some seafaring references.1\nAs the book kindly cited by Nicole says, I am given to providing the “straight skinny.”2 I am a\nTexan. I speak bluntly and directly. I am not given to circumlocution, and I checked diplomacy\nat the door when I gave up my post as an ambassador and trade negotiator. Please don’t take\noffense and please bear in mind that my comments this evening are mine alone; I do not claim to\nspeak for anybody else in the Federal Reserve System.\nI shall start my remarks with what I argued at last week’s FOMC meeting, then finish with some\ncomments on the outcome of that meeting and what needs to be done next.\nThe Recent FOMC Meeting\nIt will come as no surprise to those who know me that I did not argue in favor of additional\nmonetary accommodation during our meetings last week. I have repeatedly made it clear, in\ninternal FOMC deliberations and in public speeches, that I believe that with each program we\nundertake to venture further in that direction, we are sailing deeper into uncharted waters. We are\nblessed at the Fed with sophisticated econometric models and superb analysts. We can easily\nconjure up plausible theories as to what we will do when it comes to our next tack or eventually\nreversing course. The truth, however, is that nobody on the committee, nor on our staffs at the\nBoard of Governors and the 12 Banks, really knows what is holding back the economy. Nobody\nreally knows what will work to get the economy back on course. And nobody—in fact, no\ncentral bank anywhere on the planet—has the experience of successfully navigating a return\nhome from the place in which we now find ourselves. No central bank—not, at least, the Federal\nReserve—has ever been on this cruise before.\nThis much we do know: Our engine room is already flush with $1.6 trillion in excess private\nbank reserves owned by the banking sector and held by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Trillions\nmore are sitting on the sidelines in corporate coffers. On top of all that, a significant amount of\nunderemployed cash—or fuel for investment—is burning a hole in the pockets of money market\nfunds and other nondepository financial operators. This begs the question: Why would the Fed\nprovision to shovel billions in additional liquidity into the economy’s boiler when so much is\npresently lying fallow?\nGreat battles at sea are fought with modern analytical tools and the most sophisticated IT and\nadvanced weaponry available. Fleet commanders, like central bankers, use every bit of the\nintelligence, technology and theory at their command. But ultimately, just as with great\nengagements at sea, the decisive factor is judgment. In forming their judgments, fleet\ncommanders rely upon briefings from their senior officer corps on the elements, on the\nconditions at hand and on their tactical and strategic recommendations before deciding on the\nproper course of action.\n2\n\n\fAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s mission is mandated by the Congress. It calls for us to\nsteer a monetary course according to a dual mandate—we are charged with maintaining price\nstability while conducting policy so as to best assist in achieving full employment. Most all of\nthe FOMC members—the senior officer corps of the Federal Reserve fleet—have surveyed the\nhorizon from their different watch stations and agree that inflation is not an immediately\nforeseeable threat. Over the past week, however, there has been a noticeable increase in the\nlonger-term inflation expectations inferred from bond yields. These inferences can be volatile\nand are not always reliable, but a sustained increase would suggest incipient doubts about our\ncommitment to the Bernanke Doctrine of sailing on a course consistent with 2 percent long-term\ninflation. I believe that even the slightest deviation from this course could induce some\ndebilitating mal de mer in the markets.\nCharting a Course to Full Employment with Businesses at ‘Sixes and Sevens’\nIn the current tumultuous economic sea, facing strong headwinds common in the aftermath of\nfinancial crises and balance-sheet recessions, our desired port is increased employment. Certain\ntheories and various hypothetical studies and models tell us that flooding the markets with\ncopious amounts of cheap, plentiful liquidity will lift final demand, both through the “wealth\neffect” channel and by directly stimulating businesses to expand and hire. And yet from the\nperspective of my watch station—as I have reported time and again—the very people we wish to\nstoke consumption and final demand by creating jobs and expanding business fixed investment\nare not responding to our policy initiatives as well as theory might suggest.\nSurveys of small and medium-size businesses, the wellsprings of job creation, are telling us that\nnine out of 10 of those businesses are either not interested in borrowing or have no problem\naccessing cheap financing if they want it. The National Federation of Independent Business\n(NFIB), for example, makes clear that monetary policy is not on its members’ radar screen of\nconcerns, except that it raises fear among some of future inflationary consequences; the principal\nconcern of the randomly sampled small businesses surveyed by the NFIB is with regulatory and\nfiscal uncertainty.3 This is not terribly difficult to understand: If you are a small business,\nespecially, and not only if you operate as an S corporation or as a limited liability company, you\nare stymied by not knowing what your tax rate will be in future years, or how you should cost\nout the social overhead of your employees or how you should budget for the proliferation of\nregulations flowing from Washington.\nWith regard to business fixed investment and job-creating capital expenditures (capex), the math\nis pretty straightforward: Big businesses dominate that theater. Most all of these businesses have\nabundant cash reserves or access to money, many at negative real interest rates. I have repeatedly\nreported to the committee that the CEOs I personally survey will simply not be motivated by\nfurther interest rate cuts to invest domestically—beyond their maintenance needs—in jobcreating capex. In preparing for this last FOMC meeting, I specifically asked my corporate\ninterlocutors the following question: “If your costs of borrowing were to decrease by 25 or more\nbasis points, would this induce you to spend more on job-creating expansion?” The answer from\nnine out of 10 was “No.”\nThe responses of those I surveyed are best summarized by the comments of one of the most\nhighly respected CEOs in the country: “We are in ‘stall mode,’ stuck like Velcro, until the fog of\nuncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and the debacle in Europe lifts. In the meantime, anything\nfurther monetary accommodation induces in the form of cheaper capital will go to buying back\n3\n\n\four stock.” This is not an insignificant sounding, coming as it did from the CEO of a company\nthat has the capacity to spend upward of $15 billion on capex.\nTo be sure, buying in stock will have a positive wealth effect on that company’s shareholders,\nbut putting the equivalent amount of money to work in spending on plant and equipment would\nput more people back to work more quickly.\nAnother CEO of a large corporation provided me with an additional source of uncertainty. In this\nCEO’s words, China “may be transitioning toward becoming the caboose of the global economy\nrather than its engine.” This may be a tad bit hyperbolic, but it indicates there is growing\nuncertainty about the great emerging economy that was once considered an eternal fountain of\nfuture demand.\nWith the disaster that our nation’s fiscal policy has become and with uncertainty prevailing over\nthe economic condition of both Europe and China and the prospects for final demand growth\nhere at home, it is no small wonder that businesses are at sixes and sevens in committing to\nexpansion of the kind we need to propel job creation.\nThe Duke University Survey\nMy assessment of the efficacy of further monetary accommodation in encouraging job-creating\ninvestment among operating businesses was recently confirmed by a more rigorous analysis in\nthe Global Business Outlook Survey of chief financial officers by the Fuqua School of Business\nat Duke University—the Harvard of the South—in September.4\nOf the 887 CFOs surveyed, only 129, or 14.5 percent, listed “credit markets/interest rates”\namong the top three concerns facing their corporations. In contrast, 43 percent listed consumer\ndemand and 41 percent cited federal government policies. Ranking third on their list was price\npressures from competitors (thus affirming most hawks’ sense that inflationary pressure is\npresently sedentary); fourth was global financial instability. The analysts at Duke summarized\ntheir findings as follows: “CFOs believe that a monetary action would not be particularly\neffective. Ninety-one percent of firms say that they would not change their investment plans\neven if interest rates dropped by 1 percent, and 84 percent say that they would not change\ninvestment plans if interest rates dropped by 2 percent.”\nCiting the Evidence of the Unsophisticated and the Sophisticates Alike\nCiting these observations, I suggested last week that the committee might consider the efficacy\nof further monetary accommodation. When I raised this point inside the Fed and in public\nspeeches, some suggested that perhaps my corporate contacts were “not sophisticated” in the\nworkings of monetary policy and could not see the whole picture from their vantage point. True.\nBut final demand does not spring from thin air. “Sophisticated” or not, these business operators\nare the target of our policy initiatives: You cannot have consumption and growth in final demand\nwithout income growth; you cannot grow income without job creation; you cannot create jobs\nunless those who have the capacity to hire people—private sector employers—go out and hire.\nIn the period between the August FOMC meeting and the meeting last week, some very\nprominent academic and policy sophisticates also questioned the efficacy of large-scale asset\npurchases. Among them were Michael Woodford of Columbia University—a former colleague\nof Ben Bernanke’s when they were at Princeton—and Bill White of the Organization for\n4\n\n\fEconomic Cooperation and Development and formerly of the Bank for International Settlements,\nand others.\nLike me, Professor Woodford argues that the economy would not benefit from additional\nliquidity. Like me, he argues that large-scale asset purchases and maturity-extension programs\nlike Operation Twist are unlikely to appreciably stimulate private borrowing activity through\nportfolio-balance or term-premium effects.5 And as for Bill White—a globally respected\neconomist who stood up to convention and predicted in 2003 that policies being pursued at the\ntime would engender the financial crisis of 2008–09—here is what he wrote in a particularly\nthought-provoking paper a week before the Fed’s annual symposium last month at Jackson Hole,\nWyo.:6\n“In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the desirability of ultra easy monetary policy by\nweighing up the balance of the desirable short run effects and the undesirable longer run\neffects—the unintended consequences … It is suggested that there are grounds to believe that\nmonetary stimulus operating through traditional (‘flow’) channels might now be less effective in\nstimulating aggregate demand than is commonly asserted … It is further contended that\ncumulative (‘stock’) effects provide negative feedback mechanisms that also weaken growth\nover time … In the face of such ‘stock’ effects, stimulative policies that have worked in the past\neventually lose their effectiveness.\n“It is also argued … that, over time, easy monetary policies threaten the health of financial\ninstitutions and the functioning of financial markets, which are increasingly intertwined. This\nprovides another negative feedback loop to threaten growth. Further, such policies threaten the\n‘independence’ of central banks, and can encourage imprudent behavior on the part of\ngovernments. In effect, easy monetary policies can lead to moral hazard on a grand scale.\nFurther, once on such a path, ‘exit’ becomes extremely difficult. Finally, easy monetary policy\nalso has distributional effects, favoring debtors over creditors and the senior management of\nbanks in particular. None of these ‘unintended consequences’ could be remotely described as\ndesirable.”\nI do not necessarily agree with all of either Woodford’s or White’s arguments, but in light of my\nsoundings of unsophisticates and sophisticates alike, I felt an urge at the meeting last week to tie\nthe chairman to the mast, Odyssean-style, and to stuff wax in the ears of my fellow committee\nmembers, in order to resist the Siren call of further large-scale asset purchases.\nBut I have no such powers. I am only one officer in the loyal crew that sails under the command\nof Admiral Bernanke. My reports were given a fair hearing. But neither they, nor the arguments\nof others who questioned the need to provide further accommodation, carried the day, and a\ndecision was made.\nHaving weighed the various tactical and strategic arguments of his officer corps, our helmsman\ndecided to call down to the engine room and request that more coal be shoveled into the\neconomy’s boilers. It was decided that further accommodation would be required in the form of\nmortgage-backed securities purchases of $40 billion per month and that Operation Twist and the\nreinvestment of principal payments from our current holdings of agency debt and MBS would be\nmaintained: A total of $85 billion a month in additional accommodation would be added to the\nsystem at least through the end of the year. For added measure, the committee announced that if\n5\n\n\fthe outlook for employment does not improve “substantially,” it “will continue its purchases of\nagency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other\npolicy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved.” As it always does, the FOMC\nnoted that it will “take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”7\nA Fair Assessment and a Prayer\nEven though I am skeptical about the efficacy of large-scale asset purchases, I understand the\nlogic of concentrating on MBS. The program could help offset some of the drag from higher\ngovernment-sponsored entities’ fees that have been recently levied, will likely lower the spreads\nbetween MBS and Treasuries and should put further juice behind the housing market—one of\nthree durable-goods sectors that is assisting the recovery and yet is operating well below longrun potential (the other two sectors are aircraft and automobiles). The general effects of inducing\nmore refinancing may aid housing and households in other ways. Lower mortgage rates could\nhelp improve the discretionary spending power of some homeowners. Underwater homeowners\nmight have added incentive to continue meeting mortgage payments, spurring demand and\npreventing underwater mortgages from sinking the emerging housing recovery. Of course, much\ndepends on the transmission mechanism for mortgages, as my colleague Bill Dudley spoke about\nyesterday.\nDespite my doubts about its efficacy, I pray this latest initiative will work. Since the\nannouncement, interest rates on 30-year mortgage commitments have fallen about one-quarter\npercentage point—about what I had expected—so, so far, so good.\nOur Dysfunctional Congress and Drunken Sailors\nI would point out to those who reacted with some invective to the committee’s decision,\nespecially those from political corners, that it was the Congress that gave the Fed its dual\nmandate. That very same Congress is doing nothing to motivate business to expand and put\npeople back to work. Our operating charter calls for us to conduct policy aimed at achieving full\nemployment in addition to preserving price stability. A future Congress might restrict us to a\nsingle mandate—like other central banks in the world operate under—focused solely on price\nstability. But unless or until that is done, we have to deliver on what the American people, as\nconveyed by their elected representatives, expect of us.\nOne of the most important lessons learned during the economic recovery is that there is a limit to\nwhat monetary policy alone can achieve. The responsibility for stimulating economic growth\nmust be shared with fiscal policy. Ironically, and sadly, Congress is doing nothing to incent job\ncreators to use the copious liquidity the Federal Reserve has provided. Indeed, it is doing\neverything to discourage job creation. Small wonder that the respondents to my own inquires\nand the NFIB and Duke University surveys are in “stall” or “Velcro” mode.\nThe FOMC is doing everything it can to encourage the U.S. economy to steam forward. When\nwe meet, we consider views that range from the most cautious perspectives on policy, such as\nmy own, to the more accommodative recommendations of the well-known “doves” on the\ncommittee. We debate our different perspectives in the best tradition of civil discourse. Then,\nhaving vetted all points of view, we make a decision and act. If only the fiscal authorities could\ndo the same! Instead, they fight, bicker and do nothing but sail about aimlessly, debauching the\nnation’s income statement and balance sheet with spending programs they never figure out how\nto finance.\n6\n\n\fI am tempted to draw upon the hackneyed comparison that likens our dissolute Congress to\ndrunken sailors. But patriots among you might take umbrage, noting that a comparison with\nCongress in this case might be deemed an insult to drunken sailors.\nThe Plea of the Navy Hymn and ‘Illegitimum Non Carborundum’\nIf you want to save our nation from financial disaster, may I suggest that rather than blame the\nFed for being hyperactive, you devote your energy to getting our nation’s fiscal authorities to do\ntheir job.\nSince 1879, every chapel service at the Naval Academy concludes with a hymn that contains the\nfollowing plea: “O hear us when we cry for Thee, for those in peril on the sea.” We cry for a\nnation that is in peril on the blustery seas of the economy. Our people are drowning in\nunemployment; our government is drowning in debt. You—the citizens and voters sitting in this\nroom and elsewhere—are ultimately in command of the fleet that sails under the flag of the\nUnited States Congress. Demand that it performs its duty.\nJust recently, in a hearing before the Senate, your senator and my Harvard classmate, Chuck\nSchumer, told Chairman Bernanke, “You are the only game in town.” I thought the chairman\nshowed admirable restraint in his response. I would have immediately answered, “No, senator,\nyou and your colleagues are the only game in town. For you and your colleagues, Democrat and\nRepublican alike, have encumbered our nation with debt, sold our children down the river and\nsorely failed our nation. Sober up. Get your act together. Illegitimum non carborundum; get on\nwith it. Sacrifice your political ambition for the good of our country—for the good of our\nchildren and grandchildren. For unless you do so, all the monetary policy accommodation the\nFederal Reserve can muster will be for naught.”\nBut, then again, I am not Ben Bernanke. And I imagine that after listening to me this evening,\nyou might be grateful I am not.\nNow, in the great tradition of central banking, I will do my utmost to provide you with the\n“straight skinny” and avoid answering any questions you might have.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nOn March 4, 2011, President Drew Faust announced that the Navy Reserve Officers’ Training Corps would return\nto Harvard University after a 40-year absence.

            "content": "Remarks before the\nAustralian American Leadership\nDialogue\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nJuly 9, 2012\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks before the\nAustralian American Leadership Dialogue\nRichard W. Fisher\nHere is a portrait of the Australian I hold in highest regard:\n\nYou may not recognize him, so let me tell you about him.\nHe was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, on Oct. 18, 1904. On the 18th of January, 1910, he\nand his father were arrested for vagrancy in the town of Maryborough. They were taken before\nthe Police Court that day; here is what the court record states:\n“Lengthy evidence was taken from which it appears that the child’s mother had deserted her\nhusband and her [child] and is living in concubinage … The [child] has been in the care of the\nfather for several weeks; and at 4 a.m. on the 18th, the father and child were found sleeping\ntogether under a sort of grated bridge or platform … It was shown that on previous occasions, the\nfather and child have slept in the open in the streets adjoining the Railway Reserve, and under\nthe shelter of verandahs and entrees of shops that were not also used as dwellings.”\nAccording to the arresting officer, acting Sgt. George Forest, “I have seen the [father] frequently\nabout town for the last six months … I have never known him to do any work … I have seen him\n… in hotels, sometimes following drunken men. I could see he was begging … For the past two\nmonths he has almost constantly had the little boy with him day and night. I have heard\ncomplaints about the way the boy was treated … The child was hungry.”\n1\n\n\fThe decision by the court was an odd one. On Jan. 21, the magistrate ruled that, “There [being]\nno allegation of dishonesty against [the father], I discharged him … The little boy I formally\nordered to be committed to the Westbrook Reformatory School for boys for seven years.”\nWestbrook Reformatory was a tough and unforgiving place, especially, as noted by the\nmagistrate, for “a child of tender years,” barely five years old. And so on Feb. 5, Westbrook\nreceived a letter from the undersecretary of Brisbane (Queensland’s) Home Secretary’s Office\nsaying, “His Excellency the Governor … has been pleased to remit the unexpired portion of the\nsentence of detention for seven years … upon [the boy], who was convicted on a charge of being\na neglected child.”\nThe boy was released to the Diamatina Orphanage on the premise that his father would pay for a\nportion of his upkeep—common practice at the time. But on April 12, 1913, the Allora rail\nstation in Toowoomba reported that the father “was constantly in the company of drunkards and\nmen of doubtful character” and was unable to pay the needed sums for his son. “He is a man who\ndoes very little work and is living from hand to mouth,” the Allora station chief reported.\nFrom then on, the child’s destiny takes on a Dickensian arc. He is doled out to a series of foster\nhomes, one so cruel as to tie him by his ankle at night to an outdoor post, waking him in the\npredawn hours to deliver milk by horse-drawn carriage. He becomes an “apprentice”—a\neuphemism for something akin to indenture—in a tool shop, working lathes during the day and\nsleeping on the shop floor at night. At the age of 14, his teeth are so rotten they are replaced by\nfalse ones. Eventually, at the age of 17, he is released to the care of a Mr. and Mrs. Newsome. He\nmarries their daughter. They take him by ship to South Africa, where he becomes a bus driver,\nforms a partnership with a Xhosa, ends up buying the bus and then another—and eventually\nowns more buses than the South African government will tolerate of an Aussie and a black.1\nThey are taken out of the business at an unfair price, but for the first time, he has money. He falls\nin love with the daughter of a widowed Norwegian woman who cooks for a boarding house. He\ndivorces the Newsome girl and marries the woman he truly loves. With savings in hand, they set\nsail for the Promised Land, America, only to discover that his record and lack of documentation\nmake him inadmissible. He retreats to Tijuana, Mexico, where he outsmarts the bookies at the\nhorse track and crisscrosses the border to sell cars for eight years before he is admitted for U.S.\ncitizenship. He then hires out as muscle to collect a payment in Shanghai for the Spazier\nChemical and Soap Co. In Shanghai, his wife becomes pregnant; they leave Shanghai on the\nsecond-to-last ship to sail from China before Mao’s forces close the port. They dock in Los\nAngeles, and he sets about working countless jobs in countless places: He sells tools and silver in\nMexico, airplanes in Indonesia, used cars in Florida, men’s suits in New York and women’s\nundergarments in the Caribbean, retiring at 80 as the self-heralded “bra king of the Caribbean.”\nHe dies in Austin, Texas, three months past his 90th birthday.\nThe son who was conceived in Shanghai and born in Los Angeles ends up at Harvard studying\neconomics; he graduates with honors, goes on to Oxford and earns an MBA from Stanford and\nthen works at the private bank of Brown Brothers Harriman. From there, he builds his own\ninvestment firm in Dallas before becoming an ambassador and deputy minister of trade for the\nUnited States and, ultimately, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n2\n\n\fOf course, that son is me; the little boy found sleeping on the streets in Maryborough and\nbegging for food is my father.\nIn one generation, a great shift occurred: from homeless to Harvard; from a brutal reformatory in\nQueensland to the great banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York; from being\ntied by the ankle at night in the yard behind a foster home to living in the tony neighborhood of\nHighland Park, Texas; from working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night\nto becoming president and CEO of this $114 billion Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee—a group of 19 that decides monetary policy for the world’s\nmost powerful economy.\nIt is a hell of a story—a quintessential American story. It has happened time and again, not just\nto tough, determined, adventurous Aussies like my father escaping his past, but to Irishmen\nescaping famine, Jews escaping tyranny, Mexicans, Haitians, Vietnamese, Chinese and Filipinos,\nall seeking a better life. Just yesterday, I hopped in a cab in New York. The driver was a young\nman from Tibet who had won a lottery slot to immigrate to the U.S. “I am never going back,” he\nsaid. “I am going to build a life for my family right here.” As Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend,\n“Here is American openness—meaning if you are open to it, it will be open to you.”2\nEvery time I lift my fork in this beautiful dining room, I say a silent little prayer of thanks for\nwhat American openness and Australian gumption have given me. Today, I say thanks for being\nasked to host the Australian American Leadership Dialogue—for being able to join my past with\nmy present.\nThank you for being here.\nNotes\n1\n2\n\nThe Xhosa are a people indigenous to the southern portions of what is now South Africa.\n“‘Is That Allowed?’ ‘It Is Here,” by Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal, July 6, 2012.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Ramsey, and Fed and Ginger)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Max [Wells], for that kind introduction.\nWe are on the eve of the Federal Reserve’s 100th anniversary, the third and longest-lasting\ncentral bank in the history of the United States. And this year, we are celebrating the 20th\nanniversary of this wonderful building. Thank you, Ebby Halliday, for joining us. Ebby, you are\ntwo years and nine months older than we are! It is a pleasure to speak history to a woman who\nhas lived it.\nGeorge Dealey: Patron Saint of the Dallas Fed\nThis is probably the only Reserve Bank that owes its location to the local newspaper—in our\ncase, the Dallas Morning News.\nAfter Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in December 1913 and President Wilson signed\nit, cities around the nation immediately started competing to be the home of a Federal Reserve\nBank. The act established a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to select “not less than eight\nnor more than twelve” cities to host a Reserve Bank. The secretary of the treasury, comptroller of\nthe currency and secretary of agriculture were designated to serve on that committee.\nDallas, Fort Worth and Houston all expressed interest in a Reserve Bank, as did New Orleans.\nAcross the nation, more than 40 cities wanted a Federal Reserve Bank.\nAmong Texas cities, Dallas was the odds-on favorite. Fort Worth made a pretty good effort,\ndespite having only 73,312 residents—some 5,000 less than Houston and well short of the\n131,278 of the population of Dallas. However, Fort Worth’s representative may have been\ntripped up by being a tad parochial: He noted that they had 13 rail connections. Asked by a\nmember of the Reserve Bank Organization Committee if one of those connections was to Dallas,\nthe spokesman replied, “Yes, but we seldom use it.”\nBut no Texas city had the inside lead held by New Orleans: At the time, it was the 15th-largest\ncity in America, had a population over three times larger than Dallas and had an active financial\ncommunity centered on Mississippi River commerce. Besides, any official worth his salt would\nhave rather been wined and dined at Galatoire’s or Antoine’s than at any eatery in what was then\nLittle—rather than Big—“D”.\nDallas, however, had something that New Orleans did not have—a force of nature named George\nDealey. Mr. Dealey was the publisher of the Dallas Morning News. In manner and character, he\nwas quite the polar opposite of New Orleans’ “laissez les bon temps rouler” ethic. Dealey lived\nby the dictum that “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”1 When he learned of the\npotential of hosting a Federal Reserve Bank, he enacted a no-holds-barred action plan to secure\nthe franchise for Dallas.\n\n1\n\n\fMuch Ado About McAdoo\nDealey organized a pro-Dallas rally in Washington. He encouraged studies to make the case for\nour city. He lobbied the Reserve Bank Organization Committee. These were the visible parts of\nhis campaign. He applied his most effective techniques sub-rosa: He adroitly harvested his\nfriendship with an influential member of the Wilson administration—Postmaster General Albert\nBurleson—with an eye to ultimately convince the secretary of the treasury, William McAdoo.\nBurleson was a native Texan, with whom Dealey often corresponded through coded telegrams,\nusing names like “Mercury” and “Tacitus”—the Dallas Historical Society has those original\ntelegrams, along with other artifacts relating to our founding, on hand tonight. Thanks to a man\nnamed Otto Prager—the postmaster of Washington and a loyal former Dealey employee—Mr.\nDealey heard that Burleson would be traveling by train from St. Louis to Dallas. So he\ndispatched Dallas Morning News reporter Tom Finty and Dallas Clearing House executive\nHoward Ardrey to St. Louis. There, they boarded the train and “accidentally” ran into Postmaster\nGeneral Burleson. By the time the train arrived in Dallas, Burleson was convinced that our city\ndeserved a Federal Reserve Bank.\nAt Dealey’s urging, Burleson contacted Treasury Secretary McAdoo and argued the merits of\nselecting Dallas, backed up by this document here, pulled together by the Dallas Chamber, the\nDallas Clearing House and the Dallas Cotton Exchange.\n\n“Our argument,” the document summarized in its cover memo, “is particularly developed for the\nCity of Dallas; the largest city west of the Mississippi River, and south of the Missouri, with\nunexcelled railroad facilities and mail service; the telegraph, telephone and express development\nranking with the seven largest cities in the United States. We present for your distinguished\nconsideration a city now the acknowledged market of the Southwest, the distributing and\nfinancial center of the most progressive and rapidly developing section of the United States.”2\n2\n\n\fPerusing this document, one gets a glimpse into Texas bravado and the art of promotion: As I\nmentioned, there were only 131,278 people residing in Dallas versus 339,075 in New Orleans.3\nBut, the document noted, Dallas had grown by 116 percent between 1900 and 1910 and by 41.7\npercent in just the four years from 1904 to 1909—versus a measly growth rate of 18 percent for\nNew Orleans in the decade and a decline of 3.6 percent during the same four-year period.\n“Within 100 miles of Dallas,” the document claimed, “there are 1,486,041 people which is\n24,582 more than there are within 100 miles of Kansas City.”4 Kansas City and St. Louis were\nboth considered shoo-ins for hosting Federal Reserve Banks, so the document went on to note\nthat “Dallas has the largest telephone development per capita of any city in the United States”\nand “leads the world in the manufacture of cotton gin machinery and in the manufacture of\nharness and saddlery” and “sells more goods … than either St. Louis or Kansas City, and\nparticularly surpasses them … in automobiles, cement, drugs and groceries … hats and caps,\nmachinery, paper, petroleum products [and] paints and oils.”5\nOur own Bob Strauss could not have contrived a more aggressive sales pitch. Ebby Halliday\ncould not have packaged it and sold it more skillfully. And even Lyndon Johnson couldn’t have\nmore adroitly harbored and then played the trump card that Dealey and Burleson held deep in\ntheir pockets: Treasury Secretary McAdoo. They knew his preferences and style and honed their\nmessage to him, so much so that when the hearings were over, McAdoo remarked privately that,\n“Whoever prepared this brief did a damn good job and knew what the word ‘brief’ means.”\nSecretary McAdoo was not only a key player on the Reserve Bank Organization Committee, he\nwas married to Woodrow Wilson’s daughter. He decided for Dallas and, voilà, we were selected\nas the headquarters for the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve Districts.\nGeorge Dealey had secured his legacy as patron saint of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nLittle did he know at the time what a big “dealey” that would be.\n“Buy a Few Chairs and Pine-Top Tables”\nThe Dallas Fed received its “certificate of organization” on May 18, 1914. The initial\ninstructions from Secretary McAdoo to each Federal Reserve Bank were also brief: “Buy a few\nchairs and pine-top tables. Hire some clerks and stenographers, paint ‘Federal Reserve Bank’ on\nyour office door and open up. The way to begin is to begin. When you make a start, everything\nwill be smoothed out by practice.”6\nI think of McAdoo every time I wrestle with the 2,000 pages, 16 titles, 38 subtitles and 541\nsections of Dodd–Frank. Were the mandates we receive from Washington these days so simple\nand clear!\nThe Dallas Fed bought a few chairs and tables, hired a staff of 27 at an average pay of $30 a\nmonth, and on Nov. 16, 1914, opened for business in a space rented at 1309 Main St.—\npresumably painting “Federal Reserve Bank” above its office door. The Bank did not have its\nown vault, so it borrowed one about the size of a phone booth from a local bank. Today our vault\nis the size of a five-story building and occupies 571,590 cubic feet.\nThe Dallas Fed’s 27 employees worked hard to make loans to member banks and began\nimplementing a system to process checks totally from scratch. They also began putting Federal\nReserve Bank notes and Federal Reserve notes into circulation, eventually replacing National\n3\n\n\fBank notes, which was the currency of the day. Here is an example of a National Bank note\nissued by Frost National Bank of San Antonio; we dug it out of our vaults just last Friday, and it\nis similar to other bank notes that will be on exhibit in our foyer. It is signed in Indian ink by the\nFrost Bank cashier and its president, Joe Frost, the uncle of Tom Frost, who served on our board\nof directors from 1988 to 1993. Today, Frost Bank is the third-largest commercial bank\nheadquartered in the region, and its stock has consistently outperformed an index of publicly\ntraded banks nationwide; it is supervised by the Dallas Fed.\n\n4\n\n\fHere is one of the first Federal Reserve Bank notes put into circulation following the Federal\nReserve Act.\n\nYou will notice the “11-K” that is printed on its face. The letter “K” is the 11th letter in the\nEnglish alphabet; hence, this is a “Dallas” or “Eleventh District dollar.” To this day, dollar bills\nordered and circulated by the Dallas Fed feature prominently the letter “K” on their face,\nsurrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and\nthe inner circle says “Bank of” and Dallas.”\n\n5\n\n\fWorld War I, the 1920s and Ramsey’s Leap\nAs World War I heated up, the Dallas Fed worked with the Treasury Department to help fund the\nwar by selling Liberty Loan Bonds. That required the Bank to expand its vault space, construct\nadditional teller cages and lease temporary offices in nearby buildings. By all accounts, the war\nbond effort was successful as the proceeds of sales filled the existing vault to capacity.\nWhen our El Paso, Houston and San Antonio branches were established, employees moved from\nDallas to those cities so those branches could serve customers as soon as their doors opened.\nHaving a Federal Reserve office contributed greatly to the industrial growth of El Paso, Houston\nand San Antonio.\nThe El Paso Branch was the first to open, on June 17, 1918. There wasn’t much between Dallas\nand Los Angeles, and a Federal Reserve office was needed to distribute cash to commercial\nbanks in the southwest. Our El Paso Branch still serves as a cash distribution center—along with\na cash depot in Phoenix.\nAfter a six-year stay at a second home on Commerce Street, the Dallas Fed constructed its own\nbuilding at 400 S. Akard St. in 1921.\n\nThis solid, ornate building would be our home for 71 years, until the building we are in tonight\nopened in 1992. The Akard Street office had the distinction of being one of the first—if not the\nfirst—building west of the Mississippi to have air conditioning. I suspect that perk made the\nDallas Fed a popular place to work. And its architecture made for an imposing structure. The city\nof Dallas has designated that building a historical landmark. It sold just last week to San\nFrancisco-based Digital Realty Trust Inc., which cited its “large floor-plates, high ceilings, and\nrobust floor loading making it an attractive alternative for customers in the Dallas area looking\n6\n\n\ffor high quality data center space.”7 No one can say that the Federal Reserve doesn’t build things\nof lasting value.\nIn 1920–21, the nation experienced a brief depression. One of my favorite stories of the period\noccurred in May 1921 at the Security National Bank, not too far from where we are dining this\nevening. A rumor spread that the bank was in trouble, and it suddenly was being overrun by\npanicked customers withdrawing their money. They called the Dallas Fed for help. Just in the\nnick of time, the chairman of the Dallas Fed, W.F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with\nguards and hauled a quarter-million dollars into the lobby where everyone could see it. Ramsey\njumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that there was $30 million more sitting\nin the Fed’s vault down the street, so they could quit panicking. That ended the bank run.\nI tell that story to our current chairman, Herb Kelleher, and his eyes sparkle. I can just see him\ndoing the same thing, except he would more likely have declared that there were 30 million\nbottles of Wild Turkey down the street, so they should quit fretting and join him for a drink!\nIn a sense, what Ramsey did at that bank in 1921 is pretty much what the Federal Reserve did in\n2008–09 to prevent a collapse of the financial system. Rather than having Ben Bernanke or me\nand my counterparts in the 11 other Fed banks running in to banks and jumping up on desks, the\nFed created lending facilities such as the term auction facility, the primary dealer credit facility\nand the term securities lending facility, to stem the fear and panic that threatened global\neconomic collapse. Those actions were a little more sophisticated than what W.F. Ramsey did in\n1921, but the concept is pretty much the same. Money and banking, in the end, is a confidence\ngame, and our job at the Federal Reserve is to preserve confidence.\nUltimately, the 1920s turned out to be a prosperous decade for the Eleventh District and its\nbanks. In 1927, deposits in the district reached $1 billion, up from $312 million in 1914.\nFed and Ginger\nOver time, the Dallas Fed developed a reputation for providing reliable, high-quality services to\nits member banks, acting primarily as a supplier of currency and coin, and providing centralized\ncheck-clearing operations. A bundle of checks would arrive at the Bank, and employees would\nspend the night sorting them by hand. Check clearing was particularly monotonous work, so the\nemployees in the check department would make their own entertainment: Back in the 1920s,\nnight check employees would sing while doing their jobs. One employee was such a good singer\nthat his coworkers encouraged him to hit the stage. So this fellow, a man named Jack Culpepper,\nworked up an act and hit the vaudeville circuit under the stage name of “Jack Pepper.” Soon, he\nwas joined by another vaudevillian, a dancer named Ginger. They got married and performed as\n“Ginger and Pepper.” Unfortunately, the marriage didn’t last long, and Ginger found another\ndance partner. His name was Fred Astaire. Her name, of course, was Ginger Rogers. Poor Jack\nCulpepper’s career never recovered—neither at the Dallas Fed nor on the dance stage. But in his\nhonor, here at the Bank we refer to the most famous of dance duos as “Fed and Ginger,” for if it\nhadn’t been for our own Jack Culpepper, Ms. Rogers would never have found Mr. Astaire.\nThe Great Depression: Plus ça change …\n\n7\n\n\fDuring the Great Depression, our employees rallied and did their part to serve the Eleventh\nDistrict and the nation. Here is what my predecessor from the period, R.R. Gilbert, wrote in his\nmemoirs:\n“During the early months [of 1933], northern and eastern states had experienced widespread\nbanking difficulties with deposits declining sharply, increased hoarding of currency and gold …\nand many bank failures. This condition became progressively worse and on March 6, [President\nRoosevelt] issued a proclamation directing all banking institutions in the country to observe a\n‘bank holiday.’ ... On March 13, the reserve banks and all licensed member banks in the 12\nFederal Reserve districts were authorized to reopen. … 574 member banks out of a membership\nof 588 applied to this bank to re-open. 515 were licensed then and by the middle of April, 16\nadditional banks were licensed. The 43 remaining banks were not licensed to reopen. … During\nsucceeding weeks … reserve bank officials made every possible effort to help those institutions\nget their affairs in order to permit their reopening. Some of the banks were placed in the hands of\n‘conservators’ [and] some were consolidated with other institutions. … The Banking Act of 1933\nwas passed shortly and … the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was set up which\nmaterially assisted in restoring public confidence in the banking system.”8\nDuring this time, Congress also authorized the Federal Reserve to lend to individuals, firms and\ncorporations to promote economic activity under exigent circumstances. Plus ça change, plus\nc’est la même chose. The Fed used this same authority during the 2008–09 financial crisis to help\nprevent another Great Depression. And Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Act to restore public\nconfidence in the banking system. We shall only know with the passage of time if Dodd–Frank,\nand the implementation of its dictates by regulators such as the Federal Reserve, will do the trick.\nThe “Keepers of the Bank”\nIt is important to bear in mind that after a financial crisis of grand proportions, it takes time for\nthe economy to heal. The Depression worsened after the Banking Act of 1933 and the\nestablishment of the FDIC. The worsening economy affected the Dallas Fed’s culture, sometimes\nin ways that would be unimaginable today. For example, as the national unemployment rate rose\nto 25 percent, the bank instituted a policy to expand job opportunities for married men who were\nsupporting families. That policy mandated that no married woman was allowed to work for the\nBank or its branches. A similar policy today would most definitely be frowned upon by my first\nvice president and chief operating officer, Helen Holcomb; by my chief financial officer,\nMeredith Black; the head of supervision and regulation, Ann Worthy; and Joanna Kolson, the\nsenior vice president who oversees our vaults and facilities. And I am certain it would become\nthe subject of immediate litigation by our in-house attorney, Sharon Sweeney. Not long ago, the\nDallas Morning News wrote a fine piece on “The Keepers of the Bank,” highlighting the fact that\nwe have more women in senior leadership positions at the Dallas Fed than just about any other\nmajor business in Dallas.9 I am very proud of the remarkable women, and men, who are my\npartners in operating this Bank.\nWorld War II to Date\nAs the night is long, I will not go much further down memory lane, except to point out that\nduring World War II, 270 Dallas Fed employees served in the military, including the chairman of\nthe board, Jay Taylor, who served as a major in the U.S. Army. Employees entering military\nservice were guaranteed reemployment, restoration of retirement benefits and one month’s salary\nupon return. In the years following the war, the Bank instituted health benefits, a formal vacation\n8\n\n\fpolicy and a 40-hour workweek. We have always been a community and nationally minded\ninstitution and have been at the vanguard of many progressive changes in personnel policies.\nGeorge Dealey’s Dream Realized\nTo wrap up, I’ll skip ahead to the present. When the Dallas Fed opened, there were 27\nemployees; today we have 1,350. The Bank had $21.8 million in assets after its first year in\nbusiness; we closed last year with a $113 billion balance sheet. In the last census taken before the\nFed’s founding, Dallas was the 58th-largest city in America and Houston was the 68th. Today,\nHouston proper is the fourth-largest American city and Dallas, the ninth—and we do have an\nactive railroad connection with our dear friends and collaborators in Fort Worth. Texas is now\nthe second-largest state with over 25 million residents.\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District has outpaced the other Federal Reserve districts in\nemployment growth and growth of output.\n\nTexas—which accounts for about 96 percent of the Eleventh District’s economic output—is by\nfar the leading exporting state and has the nation’s second-largest manufacturing base. Our state\nproduces more oil than Norway and almost as much natural gas as Canada despite having only 2\npercent of our workforce employed in energy production and mining and related services. That 2\npercent, plus the other 98 percent of our state’s workforce, has experienced growth that has far\noutpaced the rest of the nation for the past two decades and longer.\n\n9\n\n\fWe’ve even outpaced the major global economies in job growth, as well as the great resourceintensive countries of Canada and Australia.\n\nWe’ve come a long way from just leading the world in the manufacture of cotton gin machinery\nand of harness and saddlery, and selling more hats and caps than Kansas City or St. Louis. If\nanything, George Dealey’s chutzpah and the hyperbolic presentation made by the Dallas\n10\n\n\fChamber, the Clearing House Association and the Cotton Exchange to Secretary McAdoo and\nthe Reserve Bank Organizers of 1913 was understated. Texas has become one of the most\npowerful pistons in the economic engine of 21st century America. It took great vision to imagine\nthat 100 years ago.\nAs history buffs, you are all familiar with T.R. Fehrenbach, who wrote the classic Lone Star: A\nHistory of Texas and the Texans. Let me quote from that great book: “The Texan ethic and Texas\nsociety rewarded enterprise. … Work was the real virtue. We chose this land; we took it; we\nmade it bear fruit.”10 George Dealey and his friends chose this city, took the Federal Reserve\nfranchise and made it bear fruit. I couldn’t be more blessed than having the privilege nearly a\ncentury later to lead this enterprising Bank and represent the hard-working, virtuous citizens of\nthe Eleventh Federal Reserve District in the policy forums of the Federal Reserve System.\nThank you all.\nNotes\nSee Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans, by T.R.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nLa Jolla, California\nJune 7, 2012\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fImplications of Renminbi Internationalization for the U.S.\nand the Global Economy\n(With Reference to Wu Yi, Being Manufactured in China, Yang Rui,\nDeng Xiaoping and Avoiding the Middle-Income Trap)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am honored to speak at this conference on the internationalization of the renminbi. It is a very\ntimely topic, particularly since China has recently accelerated the pace of currency reform.\nBefore I delve into these weighty matters, however, I’d like to mention my embryonic\nconnection to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\n‘Manufactured in China’\nIn 1948, my father, accompanied by my mother, was sent to Shanghai to collect a dollar payment\nowed to the U.S.-based Spazier Chemical and Soap Co. They left the Peace Hotel and Shanghai\nright before the People’s Liberation Army closed the port, my father with payment in hand and\nmy mother with child; I was born in Los Angeles five months later. It is thus no exaggeration to\nsay that I have literally had an interest in China my entire life, something that my Chinese\ninterlocutors have wryly noted. When I was deputy U.S. trade representative helping Charlene\nBarshefsky negotiate China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Madam Wu\nYi—the tough-as-nails “Iron Lady” of China—used to say, “I like Ambassador Fisher because\nhe was manufactured in China.”\nSusan [Shirk], I am grateful for your invitation to let a lifetime China watcher speak here today.\nThis afternoon, I will discuss the prospects for the internationalization of the renminbi and\nconclude with some thoughts on the implications for the United States going forward. For those\nof you who are up-to-the-minute in touch with all matters Chinese, I trust nothing I say will\nmake its way into Yang Rui’s microblog or feed the suspicions of the editors of the People’s\nDaily (and please note that I am from Texas, not Oklahoma!).1, 2 I seek neither to “demonize” nor\nimpose a “colonial” view on China, nor do I wish to fawn over her. My comments today merely\ndraw upon the facts, from lessons learned as a student of economics and from my personal\nexperiences in China.\nMost of you are aware that China announced a series of foreign exchange policy measures in the\npast couple of months. The renminbi’s daily trading band around the U.S. dollar has widened\nfrom 0.5 percent to 1 percent. In addition, HSBC recently placed 2-billion-yuan bonds in\nLondon, the first renminbi bond issue outside mainland China and Hong Kong.3 China now\nallows some domestic banks to hold overnight long positions of renminbi. In other words, these\nbanks can short foreign currencies, such as the dollar, if they wish. All of these policy changes\ndemonstrate China’s determination to reform its exchange-rate policy and, I believe, its ultimate\nambition to transform the renminbi into a leading global currency.\nIn the long run, a fully convertible currency and flexible exchange-rate regime are good for both\nChina and the world economy. These recent reforms, then, are welcomed as a step in the right\ndirection. However, overhauling a country’s exchange-rate regime and inspiring confidence from\n1\n\n\finternational investors are lengthy processes, and Chinese policymakers must bear in mind the\nrisks associated with capital account liberalization. Before discussing some of these risks, I\nwould like to first offer my take on the Chinese economy from a broader perspective.\nCrossing the River by Touching the Stones\nChina has undergone two crucial stages of transformation that have seen its economy progress\nfrom a closed and centrally planned system to one more open and fueled by the private sector.\nThe first stage occurred in the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping shifted the country’s attention\nfrom extreme political ideology to economic development. Following his famous arguments that\n“poverty is not socialism” and “to be rich is glorious,” China’s domestic production became\nmore responsive to dictates from the market than from the political power structure.\nThe second stage arrived in 2001, when China joined the WTO and became more actively\nengaged in global production activities. China’s international trade exploded, and the country\nquickly ascended to become the world’s largest supplier of manufactured goods.\nI am grateful to have played roles, however minor, in both of these remarkable transformations.\nAs mentioned, I served as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration from\n1997 to 2001 and was a member of the team that negotiated the bilateral accords for China's\naccession to the WTO. In the late 1970s, I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of\npolicy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, helping to normalize\nthe China–U.S. trade relationship.\nOn Feb. 23, 1979, Secretary Blumenthal and his team—which included me as his faithful chef de\ncabinet—flew to Beijing to meet with Deng Xiaoping and other senior government officials. The\nmission of the trip was to settle the counterclaims between the U.S. and China stemming from\nthe communist takeover in 1949. Soon after that change, the PRC seized railroad stock and other\nU.S. assets invested in Chiang Kai-shek’s government. In retaliation, the U.S. froze the assets of\nChinese account-holders in U.S. banks. Obviously, normal trade was impossible without\nresolving this dispute. After arduous negotiations with Deng and Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu,\nwe sealed a preliminary deal to settle these counterclaims on March 1, 1979, and on that very\nday, reopened the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\nHere are two of my favorite mementos from that negotiation. The first is our joint negotiating\n“team” picture. The young fellow towering over Deng Xiaoping is me, if, indeed, anybody could\n“tower over” what some historians consider the leading transformational figure of the 20th\ncentury.4\n\n2\n\n\fThe second is the cover photo on the March 3 issue of the People’s Daily. This picture depicts\nChairman Hua Guofeng, Mao Zedong’s placeholder successor, escorting Secretary Blumenthal\n(left), Undersecretary Tony Solomon (who later became president of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York) and, behind them, me and the rest of our delegation into the Great Hall of the\nPeople.\n\n3\n\n\fChina has experienced tremendous change since those photos were taken 33 years ago. During\nour trip to Beijing in 1979, we barely saw any cars on the street other than our own motorcade.\nThe best data we have estimates that China produced only 5,000 cars in 1980, most all for\nofficialdom. In 2009, China surpassed the United States in the annual volume of auto output and\nsales for the first time. In 2010, more than 9.5 million passenger cars were manufactured in\nChina, while auto sales reached 18.5 million units in 2011.\nDeng’s economic reforms have fueled the rapid expansion of China’s economy. During our\nsettlement-of-claims discussions, Deng said during an informal session what he later repeated\npublicly in Guangdong: “It doesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.”\nWell, China has caught plenty of mice—gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2011 is\nmore than 14 times greater than what it was in 1980.5 China is now the second-largest economy\nin the world.\nAlong with these remarkable achievements, what has impressed me deeply about the Chinese has\nbeen their willingness to adopt and adapt. China started down the road to economic reform in the\nearly 1980s by allowing private production in rural areas. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union and economic liberalization in India in the 1980s and 1990s, it\nbecame clear that the centrally planned economic model was unsustainable. As a response, the\npace of reform in China accelerated in the 1990s. The PRC removed its state-owned enterprises\nfrom many sectors to foster private activity and removed migration restrictions to encourage\nlabor mobility across regions, especially to coastal areas and, most recently, inland.\nWhile the people of China are eager for economic reform, policymakers are usually more\ncautious. This emphasis on balance and patience is captured by Deng’s famous dictum to “cross\nthe river by touching the stones.” Such gradual changes have thus far worked very well for\nChina, compared with many countries that attempted a quick switch from a centrally planned\neconomy to a market-based system. In the last 20 years, China hasn’t fallen prone to bouts of\ncrises that plagued many of its emerging-economy counterparts. Its GDP growth rate has\nremained at 8 percent or above for most of the past three decades.\nInflection Point: Avoiding the ‘Middle-Income Trap’\nChina, however, now finds itself at another inflection point. Many emerging markets experience\nrapid economic growth when they first open to the global economy. The reallocation of labor and\nother resources in these countries toward the sectors in which they have comparative advantages\nresults in rapid productivity gains. An inflow of new technologies and the capital to finance their\nadoption also moves the country’s production to higher frontiers and often brings about\nexplosive economic growth. Except for a few notable exceptions, such as Japan and South\nKorea, many emerging economies have been unable to sustain this pace of expansion, slowing\nsharply long before their per-capita income approaches levels seen in advanced economies such\nas the U.S.—enveloping them in what some economists call the “middle-income trap.”6\nIn the last few months, many business operators and economists have shared with me their\nconcerns regarding rising labor costs in China. Several provincial governments have dictated\nsome dramatic mandatory minimum-wage increases—in 2011, Chongqing mandated an increase\nof 32 percent, Shandong 26 percent and Beijing 20 percent. According to a recent report from the\nBoston Consulting Group, by 2015 the total labor cost savings of manufacturing in China will\nonly be about 10 to 15 percent when labor productivity is taken into account.7 After factoring in\n4\n\n\ftransportation costs and operational efficiencies, it has become more economical for some\nmanufacturing companies to shift production to other low-cost countries, such as Vietnam and\nMexico and, in some cases, even to the United States. Indeed, with increasing frequency, I’ve\nnoticed news articles documenting tire, steel, appliance and even television manufacturers\nshifting production back to the U.S.8 These increasing labor costs indicate that the pool of\ncompetitively priced labor in China may be close to drying up and that economic growth\nsustained by simply reallocating labor to the sectors where China enjoys a comparative\nadvantage is nearing an end.\nConsequently, China will likely have to rely on increasing economic efficiency to maintain rapid\ngrowth because an economic growth model based primarily on investment for export is\npresumed unsustainable in the long run. This begs the question: How can Chinese policymakers\nfacilitate increases in economic efficiency and change the growth model? Prudent first steps lie\nin harnessing creative destruction and promoting competition to boost efficiency in\noverregulated sectors dominated by state-owned enterprises.\nReforming the Financial Sector\nTo that end, reforming China’s financial sector is a critical step in providing long-run growth\nsustainability. Lessons and warnings from other emerging economies, whose lack of financial\nsector efficiency and transparency keeps them mired in the middle-income trap, are well known.\nChina’s economic miracle may face the same pitfall if it does not reform its financial sector.\nThis process of liberalization was codified in China’s accession to the WTO. Upon entrance,\nChina agreed to liberalize its financial sector, and timetables and deadlines were negotiated on\nwhen pre-WTO restrictions on foreign ownership and access to foreign and local-currency\nmarkets would expire. China agreed that within five years of WTO accession, foreign financial\ninstitutions would be permitted to provide services to all Chinese clients and geographic\nrestrictions on where these institutions could conduct business were to be lifted. China has fallen\nbehind on this schedule; many of the hurdles foreign firms faced before China’s accession to the\nWTO remain.\nChina’s recent foreign exchange policy reforms, such as the announcement of the People’s Bank\nof China (PBOC) authorizing direct renminbi–yen trading, are small steps in the right direction,\nand I expect China to continue crossing this river, albeit by feeling the stones along the way.\nAfter all, it is hard to imagine that the world’s second-largest economy will maintain a fixed\nexchange rate and a tightly controlled capital account forever.\nInternationalizing the Renminbi\nI have two convictions regarding the internationalization of the renminbi and China’s capital\naccount liberalization. First, I believe China should accelerate changes to improve the quality of\ndomestic financial institutions before relaxing many of its capital account restrictions. Second, I\nexpect China will adopt a posture of gradualism when internationalizing its currency.\nUnlike trade liberalization, the consequences from capital account reforms are more nuanced.\nCapital account liberalization increases the efficiency of the global economy by allowing\ninternational capital to flow to the country that needs it most. However, rapid cross-border\ncapital flows may also deal a severe blow to an individual country’s capital account, unleashing a\ndynamic that can end in tears—predicating a financial crisis followed by a prolonged and painful\n5\n\n\frecession. Examples of the danger of unsustainable international capital flows to emerging\neconomies abound— in much of Latin America throughout the 1980s and in the downturns in\nMexico and some Asian countries in the 1990s. As the recent financial crisis demonstrated, even\nso-called advanced economies are not immune. The last thing we want to see is a similar crisis in\nan economy the size of China’s.\nHistory teaches that the benefit of capital account liberalization depends on the maturity of the\ndomestic financial sector, with more developed, well-regulated structures yielding greater\nrewards from greater capital account openness. When a country has relatively deep financial\nmarkets to handle the ebbs and flows of rapid capital movements, it is less vulnerable to financial\ncrises, especially if those markets are properly regulated. High-quality, prudently regulated\nfinancial institutions also help direct capital inflows to those sectors with the highest\nproductivity. However, if institutions are weak and structurally unsound and regulation is\nprecarious, liberalization can be a bane rather than a boon to economic growth. We have\nexperienced this even in the deepest and most advanced marketplace in the world—the United\nStates.\nIs China Ready to Proceed?\nWe know the conditions under which capital account liberalization turns out well for emerging\neconomies, but the trillion-dollar question remains: Is China ready to face the full implications of\nthese reforms?\nChina has made moderate progress upgrading its financial sector over the past 20 years.\nHowever, several concerns remain, making the outcome of liberalization unclear. Right now, the\nmost important price in the Chinese financial marketplace—the interest rate on bank loans—is\nnot yet fully determined by the market. Just yesterday, the PBOC gave banks some leeway for\nlending rates, announcing that they will be allowed to lend at as much as 20 percent, from 10\npercent, below the official rate. But, essentially, the PBOC still dictates both interest rates\ncharged and the amount of loans commercial banks can make.\nMoreover, China’s securities markets, especially for bonds, are less developed than other major\nfinancial markets. In 2011, the outstanding stock of debt securities issued domestically amounted\nto $26.3 trillion in the U.S., compared with just $3.3 trillion in China. Bond liquidity remains\nvery low in China; in fact, most debt securities are held until maturity and never traded. China’s\nequity market is also relatively small and shallow. The capitalization of the Shanghai and\nShenzhen stock exchanges is about 80 percent lower than the combined market capitalization of\nthe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. Indeed, in many areas of financial\nmarket depth and breadth—foreign exchange turnover, exchange-traded derivative contracts,\nfunds management assets, hedge fund assets and private equity—China trails not only the United\nStates, but also Britain, Japan, France, Germany and Singapore.\nIt should be acknowledged that China has undertaken significant steps to reform its banks. Some,\nespecially those that are publicly listed, operate similarly to their western counterparts. However,\nmany loans are still dictated by administrative policy orders rather than by economic efficiency.\nState-owned enterprises usually have easier access to credit and more favorable loan terms than\nprivate enterprises receiving loans from state-owned banks. To increase banking sector\nefficiency, China should remove entry barriers to allow domestic private banks to enter and\nequally compete with state-owned banks. The “big four” state-owned banks dominate the\n6\n\n\fChinese banking industry, and their too-big-to-fail status and explicit government support\nundermine market discipline, just as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the too-big-to-fail banks do\nhere in the United States.\nAllowing more domestic competitors in the banking sector can help alleviate this issue. In the\ncase of China, policymakers will need to operate state-owned banks based on a robust,\nprudentially regulated but profit-seeking model to fully embrace market reforms and the\ncompetition from domestic and foreign private banks that such reforms entail. On May 26, the\nChina Banking Regulatory Commission relaxed some restrictions for private investors to\nparticipate in the banking sector. I was pleased to see such changes and hope China’s\npolicymakers follow up with additional reforms to encourage transparency and fair competition\nin the banking sector.\nIn addition to China’s present domestic financial market infrastructure, the current domestic and\ninternational economic landscape is hardly hospitable to rapid capital account liberalization in\nChina.\nFollowing the global financial crisis in 2008, the Chinese government stimulated its economy\nwith a 4-trillion-yuan package, or about $585 billion, an intervention far more aggressive than\nthat chosen by any other major economy, especially relative to China’s GDP. The stimulus\npackage cushioned the country’s economy from the collapse of international demand for Chinese\nexports, but it also created unpleasant effects that policymakers must now confront. Inflationary\npressures have eased following the PBOC’s tightening monetary policy in the last two years.\nHowever, asset bubbles in the real estate market and mounting local government debt remain\nserious threats to China’s financial outlook.\nLurking in the Shadows…\nDuring the recent credit boom fueled by the 4-trillion-yuan fiscal stimulus, off-balance-sheet\nlending by banks and private loans by nonbanks exploded. This shadow-banking lending activity\naccounted for an estimated 20 percent of China’s total loans in 2011. With the cooling of the real\nestate market and with slower economic growth likely in the near term, a large share of these\nloans could turn bad. And because these loans took place outside the view of regulators, the\neffect of a sudden disruption in repayment is virtually impossible to predict.\nOn the international front, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone has resulted in much\nuncertainty and volatility in global financial markets. Should there be, say, a sudden and messy\nchange in the participants in the economic and monetary union, a chain reaction might ensue that\ncould result in some unpleasant responses. Just two weekends ago, for example, the Swiss\nNational Bank warned that it is considering capital controls on foreign deposits if Greece leaves\nthe euro zone. Clearly, any policy shifts affecting China’s capital account must recognize the\ncurrent fragility of global financial markets.\nImplications for the United States\nI would like to conclude my remarks with a few thoughts on the implications for the United\nStates of an internationally traded renminbi.\nMy erudite friend, Barry Eichengreen, will speak to you tomorrow morning. I will leave in-depth\nanalysis for the future prospects of the U.S. dollar in his capable hands. Suffice it to say that for\n7\n\n\fnow, the U.S. dollar enjoys an “exorbitant privilege” as the dominant international currency.\nDespite the best efforts of the Congress of the United States to fritter away that privilege through\nreckless fiscal policy, I do not expect the supremacy of the dollar to face an immediate challenge.\nIt takes time for a major global currency to emerge and even more time for it to become\ndominant. Until recently, the dollar had no serious competitors for that status. But the creation of\nthe euro—despite its current pathology—and the rise of new, ambitious economies like China\nthreaten to challenge the dollar’s dominant role, and the privileges that come with that\ndominance, at some point.\nYet, it is important to remember that dominant global currencies benefit from inertia, and old\nhabits die hard. Standard practices and norms evolve only gradually when people use a currency\nin international transactions over a long period, and it takes time to convince businesses and\ncentral banks that a new currency is worth holding in significant magnitudes. The liquidity and\nthe stability of the currency, and the government behind that currency, are kept under close\nwatch to see if it will pass the muster as an effective store of value and medium of exchange on a\nglobal scale. However, once a currency is chosen as the global currency, it inherits a major\nincumbency advantage. For example, the U.S. economy overtook the U.K. economy in the\n1870s, but the U.S. dollar required at least another 50 years to replace sterling as the most\nimportant global currency. Today, more than 80 percent of all global commercial foreignexchange trades involve the dollar on at least one side of a transaction.\nI do not claim that it will necessarily take more than 50 years for the renminbi to arise as a major\nglobal currency; things move more rapidly in the modern world. However, I think it safe to say\nthat such a change will not happen overnight or even within the next decade. Besides, there is no\nreason for the Chinese to rush their ambition. Doing things right almost always turns out to be\nbetter than doing them quickly.\nPresently, the only viable alternative to the U.S. dollar in terms of deep, liquid markets is the\neuro. But unless you’re from the planet Mars, you know that the euro zone has its own\ndifficulties. Despite the fiscal misfeasance in Washington, dollar-denominated government debt\nhas remained what I have called on several occasions the “best-looking horse in the glue\nfactory.” But relative performance is hardly comforting. And it is noteworthy that eurodenominated German bunds trade at a yield below that of U.S. Treasuries. We shouldn’t\nunderestimate the political will among Europe’s leaders to put in place measures that will ensure\nthat the euro comes through its present crisis, or the determination of Chinese authorities to\npromote the renminbi to the status of a global currency. Ultimately, we face a very real risk of\nhaving formidable competitors to the dollar in the sweepstakes for sovereign investment.\nIn the past 30 years, China’s economy has radically transformed from a closed and centrally\nplanned system to a more-open and dynamic powerhouse that relies increasingly on marketbased principles. Progress was made by accumulating single small steps in economic reforms,\nand China’s consistent and robust GDP growth lends credence to this policy of gradualism.\nNow China’s economy is at another crossroads. I expect that China will continue to take\nmeasured steps to liberalize its capital account and internationalize its currency. To reap the\nbenefits of a more-open capital account, the most pressing challenge confronting China is\nreforming its domestic financial sector by permitting competition from the private sector and\n8\n\n\fallowing the market to determine asset prices such as interest rates. Such changes can help China\navoid falling into the middle-income trap and enhance sustainable economic growth.\nThe seemingly inexorable rise of China and the sheer size of its economy imply that the renminbi\nmay someday play a role similar to that of the dollar. At present, it plays a very limited role on\nthe international stage. But that role has gradually grown over time and will increase further as\nChina’s already-large presence in the global economy expands. As Chinese policymakers lay the\ngroundwork for the continued internationalization of the renminbi, our nation’s fiscal authorities\nmust bear in mind that there may one day be viable alternatives to the dollar and U.S. Treasury\ndebt as primus inter pares. The status of Treasury debt as the safest, most liquid and most\ndesirable of all sovereign debt should not be treated as a foregone conclusion.\nThe privileges that status affords us will only be preserved if our fiscal authorities learn to budget\nresponsibly. They must do so in a manner that provides our engine of economic prosperity—the\nprivate sector—with incentives to adapt and expand our economy, which in turn, anchors global\nconfidence in America. Taking fiscal responsibility—and operating our central bank in a manner\nthat maintains the purchasing power of the dollar—are key to defending and extending the\nunique position in global financial markets that the United States enjoys, and can continue to\nenjoy, even if China continues successfully crossing the river by touching all the right stones,\ncatching still more of the globe’s economic mice and becoming “gloriously” richer.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nYang Rui is host of China Central Television’s show “Dialogue.” He writes a microblog that reportedly has more\nthan 800,000 followers.\n2\nSee “Before China’s Transition, a Wave of Nationalism,” by Andrew Jacobs, New York Times, May 25, 2012.\n3\nThe renminbi is the official name for the Chinese currency; yuan is the unit of currency. The relationship is similar\nto that of the sterling/pound.

Fisher\nThank you, Professor Sutherland. I am delighted to be here at St. Andrews and very much\nappreciate your organization of this meeting today. To be at the site where John Knox preached\nan epic sermon about Christ’s cleansing of the temple and overthrowing the money changers’\ntables, which was so powerful that it led to riots against the establishment of the time, the\npapacy, is daunting—nearly as much so as playing the Old Course on yesterday’s bank holiday\nwith Professor Andy Mackenzie, the university’s great scratch golfer and noted physics\nprofessor.\nIn a setting as august as this one—on the eve of the 600th anniversary of this great academy—\nand speaking on the day marking the 129th anniversary of the birth of John Maynard Keynes and\nthe 289th anniversary of the baptism of Adam Smith in nearby Kirkcaldy—I should disclose up\nfront that I am the least formally trained among the mostly academic economists who sit at the\ntable where we make monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, the 19-person forum known as the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. I have an MBA, not a PhD. I am an autodidact\nwhen it comes to monetary theory. On the other hand, I am the only participant in our policy\ndeliberations who has been both a banker and a professional money manager—the only one who\nhas been a market operator. What the credentialing gods denied me, the practitioner angels\nkindly granted me: another skill set that provides a complementary perspective to those of my\nmore learned colleagues. I shall speak today, as I always do, only from my perspective; nothing I\nsay represents the thinking or proclivities of other members of the FOMC. And most of what I\nwill say will confront theory with my interpretation of the rude reality of the marketplace.\nA Quick Primer on the Federal Reserve’s Structure\nFor those of you who do not know well our central bank’s structure, a quick primer. The Federal\nReserve is the third central bank in American history. We were created during Woodrow\nWilson’s presidency, in the aftermath of the Financial Panic of 1907. Congress passed the\nFederal Reserve Act in 1913; like St. Andrews, we will mark a centennial next year, but it will\nbe our first, while you celebrate your sixth.\nThe Federal Reserve Act established 12 Federal Reserve Banks, together with a Board of\nGovernors. The members of the Board, of which Ben Bernanke is Chairman, are appointed by\nthe president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 Bank presidents are not:\nThey serve at the pleasure of nine-member boards of directors composed of private bankers and\ncitizens from their respective districts. They are distinctly nonpolitical, immune from partisan\ninfluence; they represent Main Street, not the Washington power elite or the New York money\nchangers, just as President Wilson and the Federal Reserve founders envisioned. These are\nprofit-making banks that perform services for the private banks in their districts: warehousing\nand distributing currency; operating discount windows from which banks borrow to assist in\ntheir operating funding needs; functioning as the depository for the $1.5 trillion or so in excess\n1\n\n\freserves presently piled up and going unused in our private banking system. The Banks also\nhouse and manage staff that supervise and regulate banks in the districts (under policy guidance\nfrom the Board of Governors), and perform other services, the most widely observed and\ncommented upon of which is the operating of the open-market operations conducted by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of all 12 Banks at the instruction of the FOMC.\nAll 12 Bank presidents serve on the FOMC together with the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors. This is where monetary policy for the United States is determined by collective\ndecision. The operating procedure of the FOMC is for each of the governors to have a vote on\npolicy; the bankers rotate their votes, with the New York Fed having a constant vote. However,\nall 19 members—the seven governors and the 12 bankers—participate fully in every FOMC\nmeeting and actively contribute to policy discussions.\nThe FOMC has traditionally decided the federal funds rate, the overnight rate for interbank\nlending that anchors the yield curve. In recent years, in reaction to the Financial Panic of 2008\nand 2009 and its aftermath, the FOMC has instructed the New York desk to buy mortgagebacked securities and Treasury notes and bonds—eschewing Treasury bills. Presently, the Fed\nholds more than $850 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and over $1.6 trillion in\nTreasuries. This expansion of our portfolio and extension of maturities held therein is known as\n“quantitative easing,” or QE. After cutting the base rate for overnight lending—the fed funds\nrate—to zero, the majority of the committee decided to expand the money supply by purchasing\nMBS, notes and bonds. When we buy something in the marketplace, we pay for it, and this has\nresulted in significant liquidity floating about the U.S. economy, much of it going unused. As\nmentioned earlier, $1.5 trillion of excess reserves from private banks is on deposit in the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks, where it earns a paltry 0.25 percent, rather than being lent to job-creating\nbusinesses at rates bankers would prefer. Additionally, some $2 trillion of excess cash is parked\non corporate balance sheets—above and beyond the operating cash flow needs of the business\nsector—and copious amounts of cash are lying fallow in the pockets of nondepository financial\ninstitutions, such as private equity and other investment funds.\nA running discussion in the marketplace centers around whether the FOMC will decide to\nengage in further quantitative easing, especially given the most recent economic weakness in the\nU.S., against the backdrop of the well-known problems in Europe and slower growth in China\nand other “emerging” economies. I shall turn to that in a few moments. First, I want to go back to\nthe 12 Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n2\n\n\fDifferent Growth Patterns in the 12 Federal Reserve Districts\n\nHere is a map of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank districts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is\nresponsible for the Fed’s activity in the light green area—the Eleventh District—home to 27\nmillion people in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Roughly 96 percent of\nthe district’s output comes from Texas.\n\n3\n\n\fHere is a chart showing the disparate behavior of the economies in the 12 Federal Reserve\nDistricts, as measured by employment growth. You will see that going back to 1990—some 22\nyears—the Eleventh Federal Reserve District has outperformed the other Federal Reserve\nDistricts in job creation.\n\nIn terms of employment, the Dallas Fed’s district went into the recession last and was one of the\nfirst to come out. We have since punched through previous peak employment levels.\n\n4\n\n\fHere is the job creation record of the so-called mega-states within the United States since 1990.\nAnd last, and just for fun, here is the record of Texas’ job creation over the past two decades\nversus resource-rich countries, such as Australia and Canada, as well as versus the major\ncountries of Europe, the U.S. and Japan.\n\n5\n\n\fIndulge me for a minute here. I share these with you not to engage in stereotypical “Texas brag”\nor because St. Andrews has become a popular destination for recent generations of\nundergraduate scholars from Texas. I do so to illustrate a point, specifically the influence of\nfiscal policy on the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy and the Importance of Fiscal Policy\nHere is the rub. As mentioned, the FOMC sets monetary policy for the nation, for all 50 states—\nits influence is uniform across America. The same rate of interest is charged on bank loans to\nbusinesses and individuals in Texas as is charged New Yorkers or the good people of Illinois or\nCalifornians; Texans pay the same rates on mortgages and so on. Why is it that the Texas\neconomy has radically outperformed the rest of the states? A cheap answer is to revert to the\nhackneyed argument that Texas has oil and gas. It is true that we produce as much oil as Norway\nand almost as much natural gas as Canada. And we have some 60 percent of the refineries of the\nUnited States. But remember that the numbers I showed you are employment numbers. Only 2\npercent of employment in Texas is directly generated by oil and gas and mining and related\nservices. We are grateful that we are energy rich. But we are a diversified economy not unlike\nthe United States, where business and financial services, health care, travel and leisure activities\nand education account for similar portions of our workforce. Why, then, do we outperform the\nrest of the United States?\nTo me, the answer is obvious: We have state and local governments whose tax, spending and\nregulatory policies are oriented toward job creation. We have the same monetary policy as all the\nrest; our income is taxed at the same federal tax rate; and we are equally impacted by\nWashington’s tax, spending and regulatory policies. But we have better fiscal policy at the state\nlevel. We have no state income tax; we are a right-to-work state; we have state and local\ngovernments that, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, have for decades\nassiduously courted job creators—so much so that we have even outperformed the job creation\nof most every other major industrialized economy worldwide, as shown by the previous slide.\nWhither Monetary Policy?\nNow, back to the hue and cry of financial markets, and the question of further monetary\naccommodation. Interest rates are at record lows. Trillions of dollars are sitting on the sidelines,\nnot being used for job creation. We know that in areas of the country where fiscal and regulatory\npolicy incents businesses to expand—Texas is the most prominent of those places—easy money\nis more likely to be put to work than in places where government policy retards job creation.\nDuring the next few weeks as I contemplate the future course of monetary policy, I will be\nasking myself what good would it do to buy more mortgage-backed securities or more Treasuries\nwhen we have so much money sitting on the sidelines and yet have no sense of direction for the\nfuture of the federal government’s tax and spending policy. And with the president’s health care\nlegislation awaiting resolution in the Supreme Court, we also know that no business can budget\nits personnel costs until that case is decided. If job-creating businesses have no idea what their\ntaxes will be, are clueless about how federal spending will impact their customers or their own\nbusinesses and cannot budget personnel costs—all on top of concerns about the risk to final\ndemand posed by the imbroglio in Europe and slowing growth in emerging-market countries—\nhow could additional monetary policy be stimulative?\nA good theoretical macroeconomist can acknowledge that a great deal of liquidity is, indeed,\ngoing unused at present. They might likely argue that further monetary accommodation would\n6\n\n\fraise inflationary expectations by magnifying the fear that the Fed and other monetary authorities\nare hell-bent on expanding their balance sheets and, consequently, the money supply so\ndramatically that inflation will inevitably follow. The result, the good macroeconomist would\ndeduce, would be salutary: It would scare money out of businesses’ pockets and into job\nexpansion and would lead individuals to conclude they better spend their money today rather\nthan have it depreciated by inflation tomorrow, thus pumping up consumption and final demand.\nI beg to differ. I would argue that this would represent a form of piling on the already enormous\nuncertainty and angst that businesses face with our reckless fiscal policy. To me, that would be\nthe road to perdition for the Federal Reserve. There is in the marketplace a lingering fear that the\nFed has already expanded its balance sheet to its stretching point and that an exit strategy, though\narticulated, remains theoretical and untested in practice. And there is a growing sense that we are\nunwittingly, or worse, deliberately, monetizing the wayward ways of Congress. I believe that\nwere we to go down the path to further accommodation at this juncture, we would not simply be\npushing on a string but would be viewed as an accomplice to the mischief that has become\nsynonymous with Washington.\nRaeburn versus Munch\nThere is no question that these are worrisome times: The world economy is slowing, joblessness\nis rampant in many countries, and in the United States, growth is anemic and unemployment\nremains unacceptably high. To me, this means that the Fed, and all central banks, must keep their\nheads about them and not give in to the convenient recommendations of those who are given to\nsolving all problems with monetary policy.\nIf only for your visual pleasure, I have chosen two paintings anybody in the vicinity of St.\nAndrews and Edinburgh would know, in order to illustrate alternative approaches to central\nbanking at this juncture.\nThe first is an icon of Scottish culture: Sir Henry Raeburn’s depiction of The Reverend Robert\nWalker Skating on Duddingston Loch, a seminal work in the permanent collection of the Scottish\nNational Gallery and a favorite of mine since I first saw it some 30 years ago.\n\n7\n\n\fTo me, Raeburn’s work provides a fitting visual metaphor for the ideal countenance of a central\nbanker: The Reverend Walker skating forward confidently and with grace upon a notably\nuneven, rocky surface on an icy, dark, blustery day.\nAn alternative depiction is Edvard Munch’s The Scream from Norway’s Gunderson Collection,\nnow on temporary exhibit at the National Gallery. (There are four versions of this pastel, one of\nwhich recently sold for $119.9 million at auction at Sotheby’s. If you haven’t been into\nEdinburgh to see the Gunderson version, I am sure you read about Sotheby’s record-setting\nauction.)\n\n8\n\n\fIn sharp contrast to Raeburn’s painting of composure, The Scream depicts a panicked form. In an\nautobiographical epigraph, Munch wrote that he conceived of the painting after a period of\nexhaustion and despair: “I stopped and leaned against the balustrade, almost dead with fatigue.\nAbove the blue-black fjord hung the clouds, red as blood and tongues of fire. My friends had left\nme, and alone, trembling with anguish, I became aware of the vast, infinite cry of nature.”1\n\n9\n\n\fI am going to conclude by suggesting that the image that best behooves central bankers as\nguardians of financial stability and agents of economic potential is that of Henry Raeburn’s\nReverend Walker. To be sure, central bankers everywhere are fatigued and exhausted and\nincreasingly friendless. But when the landscape is dark and threatening, those charged with\nmaking monetary policy must comport themselves with a grace that reassures markets and the\npublic that they are calmly in control of the sacred charge with which they have been entrusted.\nThey must keep their “cool” even when the vast, infinite cry of the money changers reaches a\nfevered pitch, the economic seas are blue-black and the clouds in the financial markets are red as\nblood and tongues of fire. Presenting an image comparable to that of the visage depicted by\nEdvard Munch—of policymakers trembling with anguish at the daunting demands of their\nprofession—would provide scant comfort to those who depend upon them to maintain their\ncomposure and skate ably across a cold and foreboding economic landscape, seeking to guide the\neconomy to a better place.\nCentral banks are just one vehicle for influencing overall macroeconomic behavior, in addition to\ninfluencing through regulation the microeconomic agents that transmit that influence to the\nmarkets—banks of deposit and other financial institutions. We work alongside another potent\nmacroeconomic lever: fiscal authorities—governments that have the power to tax the people’s\nmoney, spend it in ways they deem appropriate, and create laws and regulations that influence\nmicroeconomic behavior.\nUnless fiscal authorities can structure their affairs to incent the private sector into putting the\ncheap and ample money the Fed has provided to the economy to work in job creation, monetary\npolicy will prove impotent. And we will likely barely survive our first centennial, let alone have\nconfidence that we will reach our sixth.\nThank you.\n\n10\n\n\fNOTE\n1 “Painting and Sculpture in Europe 1880 to 1940,” by George Heard Hamilton, Baltimore, Md.:\nPenguin Books, 1967, p. 75.

            "content": "Adios “Texas Ratio”\n(With an Unauthorized Rewrite of George Strait’s\nMost Memorable Song and a Tribute to Bob Hankins)\nRemarks at the Texas Bankers Association’s 128th Annual\nConvention & Exposition\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nFort Worth, Texas\nMay 11, 2012\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAdios “Texas Ratio”\n(With an Unauthorized Rewrite of George Strait’s\nMost Memorable Song and a Tribute to Bob Hankins)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nIn many of my recent speeches, I have noted that the Texas economy is outperforming the\nnation. Here are three slides I have used to illustrate the point: We were the first large state to\npunch through prerecession peak employment levels; we have led the nation and the other\n“power” states in job growth over the past 21 years; we have even outperformed the resourcerich countries of Australia and Canada, and core European countries, England and Japan—the\nso-called advanced economies.\n\n1\n\n\f“All My Exes Live in Texas”\nLast week, I was on a panel titled “Jobs for America” at the Milken Institute’s 2012 Global\nConference in Los Angeles with John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, who now runs\nthe Business Roundtable.1 Unprompted by me, the governor led off the discussion by saying that\nhis home state of Michigan and his host state of California—indeed, the whole country—need to\nbecome more like Texas. I thanked him, and with prototypical Texas humility, suggested that we\n2\n\n\fwere simply rewriting the words to George Strait’s song, “All My Exes Live in Texas.”2 It’s not\njust ex-wives, but ex-businesses, ex-employers, ex-taxpayers and ex-voters of Michigan and\nCalifornia (and New York and other areas of the country) who are pulling up stakes and coming\nto live a new life and thrive in Texas.\nTexas Banks Continue to Outperform the Nation\nJust as we have outpaced others in job creation, our banking industry has outperformed the\nnation. For example, last year, Texas-based banks earned a return on assets (ROA) of 1.1\npercent; banks nationwide earned an ROA of 0.9 percent.\n\nThis is a pretty good performance, considering what the industry recently went through. But\nwhat’s most notable is that this marks the fifth consecutive year that Texas banks have done\nbetter than their counterparts nationwide in terms of profitability. In fact, at the height of the\ncrisis, in 2009, Texas banks earned a profit of $1.4 billion while the entire U.S. banking industry\nlost $11.5 billion.\n\n3\n\n\fThese slides tell the Texas banking story in high definition—you all are the pride of the nation’s\nbanking community.\n“Twice as Good; Half as Bad”\nMost of you remember the legendary Bob Hankins, who recently retired after 20 years as head of\nsupervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Bob had a saying that Texas banks were\n“twice as good and half as bad” as banks nationwide. That remains the case, though banks\naround the U.S. are slowly catching up with Texas. For example, in Texas last year, the\nnoncurrent loan rate was down to 2.4 percent (from 3.1 percent in 2010). At banks across the\nU.S., the noncurrent loan rate was 4.1 percent (from 4.9 percent in 2010). Charge-offs were 0.7\npercent of all loans in Texas in 2011, compared with 1.6 percent nationwide.\n\n4\n\n\fAdios Texas Ratio\nMaybe the best summary of what’s going on with Texas banks when compared with the rest of\nthe nation can be found in the so-called Texas ratio. Those of us of a certain age will remember\nthe Texas ratio, which is technically defined as noncurrent loans plus OREO (other real estate\nowned) expressed as a percentage of tangible equity capital plus loan loss reserves.3 Given that\ndefinition, no banker of any distinction would want the Texas ratio to exceed 100 percent.\n5\n\n\fWe earned that moniker in the late 1980s when 20 percent of our banks had a Texas ratio\nexceeding 100 percent. However, in 2011 only 0.9 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio\ngreater than 100 percent, compared with 4.6 percent nationwide—and that nationwide number is\ndown from a 5.7 percent peak in 2010. That’s why, for the past 10 years or so, old Bob Hankins\ninsisted on calling it the “anywhere-but-Texas ratio” and suggested it be replaced, perhaps, by\nthe “Georgia ratio.” Last year, 24 percent of banks based in Georgia recorded a Texas ratio\ngreater than 100 percent. And the peak in Georgia was even worse than the peak in Texas in the\n1980s. In 2010, a remarkable 32 percent of Georgia banks recorded a Texas ratio exceeding 100\npercent.\n\nConclusion\nWhile we pray for our banking brethren in Georgia and other areas of the country, let’s\nremember to say grace over what we have here at home. Texas is home to the nation’s best-run\nbanks. And the best-performing economy in the country.\nIn his classic tome, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans, historian T.R. Fehrenbach\nwrote: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise … work was the real virtue. We\nchose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people for whom “the cult of\ncourage was obvious.”4 This remains the case for the working men and women of this great state\nand for its business operators and bankers. It is why we thrive when others wither. It is why even\na Michigan governor sings our praises. I am counting on the Texas Bankers Association to keep\nit that way.\nGood luck and Godspeed.\n\n6\n\n\fNotes\n1\nA video of this panel can be found on the Milken Institute’s website:\nwww.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=detail&eventid=gc12&EvID=3211.\n2\n“All My Exes Live in Texas,” by Sanger D.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 5, 2012\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\f“Not to Be Used Externally, but Also Harmful if Swallowed”:\nProjecting the Future of the Economy and Lessons Learned\nfrom Texas and Mexico\nRichard W. Fisher\nI have been asked to speak about the economy. I am going to take a different approach than is\ntypical for a Federal Reserve speech. I’ll eschew making the prototypical forecast, except to note\nthat from my perch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I presently see that: a.) On balance,\nthe data indicate improving growth and prospects for job creation in 2012. However, the outlook\nis hardly “robust” and remains constrained by the fiscal and regulatory misfeasance of Congress\nand the executive branch and is subject to a now well-known, and likely well-discounted, list of\npossible exogenous shocks—the so-called “tail risks”—posed by possible developments of\ndifferent sorts in the Middle East, Europe, China and elsewhere. And b.) While price stability is\nbeing challenged by the recent run-up in gasoline prices—which has yet to be reflected in the\npersonal consumption expenditure and consumer price indexes but may well make for worrisome\nheadlines when February data are released—the underlying trend has been converging toward\nthe 2 percent long-term goal formally adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nat its last meeting.1\nAs to the outlook envisioned by the entire FOMC, you might wish to consult the forecasts of all\n17 members, which include those of yours truly, that were made public after the January\nmeeting—though I think a puckish footnote appended to the internal document laying out a\ncomponent of the December 1966 FOMC forecast might still apply: “Not to be used externally,\nbut also harmful if swallowed.”2\nSpeaking of harmful if swallowed, I might add that I am personally perplexed by the continued\npreoccupation, bordering upon fetish, that Wall Street exhibits regarding the potential for further\nmonetary accommodation—the so-called QE3, or third round of quantitative easing. The Federal\nReserve has over $1.6 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and almost $848 billion in mortgagebacked securities on its balance sheet. When we purchased those securities, we injected money\ninto the system. Most of that money and more has accumulated on the sidelines: More than $1.5\ntrillion in excess reserves sit on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve banks, including the Dallas\nFed, for which we pay private banks a measly 25 basis points in interest. A copious amount is\nbeing harbored by nondepository financial institutions, and another $2 trillion is sitting in the\ncash coffers of nonfinancial businesses.\nTrillions of dollars are lying fallow, not being employed in the real economy. Yet financial\nmarket operators keep looking and hoping for more. Why? I think it may be because they have\nbecome hooked on the monetary morphine we provided when we performed massive\nreconstructive surgery, rescuing the economy from the Financial Panic of 2008–09, and then\nkept the medication in the financial bloodstream to ensure recovery. I personally see no need to\nadminister additional doses unless the patient goes into postoperative decline. I would suggest to\nyou that, if the data continue to improve, however gradually, the markets should begin preparing\nthemselves for the good Dr. Fed to wean them from their dependency rather than administer\nfurther dosage.\n1\n\n\fI am well aware of the salutary effect of accommodative monetary policy on the equity and\nfixed-income markets—remember, I am the only member of the FOMC who used to be on the\nother side. My firms’ record of substantially outperforming the equity and fixed-income indexes\nover a prolonged period before I hung up my investment business and entered public service in\n1997 was achieved by focusing on the long-term fundamentals of the real economy and the\nunderlying value of the securities we purchased or sold—not by depending on central bank\nlargesse. Counting on the Fed to perpetually float returns is a mug’s game.\nFrom my present perspective on the side of the angels, as a member of the policymaking team on\nthe FOMC, I believe adding to the accommodative doses we have applied rather than beginning\nto wean the patient might be the equivalent of medical malpractice. Having never before pursued\nthis course of healing, we run the risk of painting ourselves further into a corner from which we\ndo not know the costs of exiting. It is my opinion that we should run that risk only in the most\ndire of circumstances, and I presently do not see those circumstances obtaining.\nSo much for forecasting and monetary policy. Let me now walk you through an overview of the\nTexas economy to set the stage for a broader discussion of what I believe continues to bedevil a\nlasting recovery and more efficient job creation in the United States.\nI will use some slides to illustrate key points.\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of when recessions begin and end, dates\nthe onset of the Great Recession as December 2007. The economic performance of Texas since\nDecember 2007 can be summarized with the chart projected on the screen. It depicts\nemployment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts. In the Eleventh Federal Reserve\nDistrict―or the Dallas Fed’s district—96 percent of economic production comes from the 25.7\nmillion people of Texas. As you can see by the red line, we now have more people at work than\nwe had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession. All told in 2011, Texas alone created\n212,000 jobs.3\n\n2\n\n\fEmployment by Federal Reserve District\nSince the Beginning of the Recession\nJob Growth Index, 100 = December 2007\n\nDallas\n\n101\n\n99\n\nMinneapolis\nNew York\nBoston\nPhiladelphia\nKansas City\nRichmond\nU.S.\nCleveland\nSt. Louis\nChicago\n\n97\n\n95\n\nSan Francisco\n\n93\n\nAtlanta\n\n91\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and\nNorth Dakota.\nReaders of this speech abroad―say, in Washington or New York―might think our growth last\nyear came only from the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as\nburgeoning: 30,000 jobs were added in oil and gas and the related support sector last year. Texas\nnow produces 2.1 million barrels of oil per day, the same amount as Norway; we produce 6.7\ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, only slightly less than Canada.4\nWith 25 percent of U.S. refinery capacity and 60 percent of the nation’s petrochemical\nproduction located in Texas, we most definitely benefit from both upstream and downstream\nenergy production.\nAnd yet other sectors gained more jobs than the oil and gas sector and its support functions in\n2011: 58,000 jobs were added in professional and business services, nearly 46,000 in education\nand health services and more than 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. Manufacturing―which\naccounts for approximately 8 percent of total Texas employment―added over 27,000 jobs.\nAll told, the private sector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs in 2011, while the public sector\ncontracted by 54,800, due primarily to layoffs of schoolteachers. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2\npercent, significantly above the national rate of 1.3 percent.\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this graph of nonagricultural\nemployment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the Eleventh\nDistrict has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the slope of the\ntop line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with each of the other\n\n3\n\n\fdistricts and, importantly, relative to employment growth for the U.S. as a whole―denoted by\nthe black line, the seventh one down.\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment by\nFederal Reserve District Since 1990\n150\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n\nDallas\n\n140\n\nKansas City\nMinneapolis\nAtlanta\nSan Francisco\nRichmond\nU.S.\nSt. Louis\n\n130\n\n120\n\nPhiladelphia\nChicago\nCleveland\nBoston\nNew York\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nAs was pointed out in high relief by the media when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the\nhunt for his party’s presidential nomination, we do have some serious deficiencies in the Lone\nStar State. We have a very large number of people earning minimum wage; we have an\nunemployment rate that, while trending downward, is still too high, abetted by continued inflows\nof job seekers from less-promising sections of the country. But I’ll bet you that those who\nconstantly enumerate our deficiencies and are given to habitual Texas-bashing would give their\nright—or should I say, left—arms to have Texas’ record of robust long-term job creation instead\nof the anemic employment growth of other megastates such as California and New York. Or\neven the job formation record of many other countries! The following chart shows that over the\npast two decades, the rate of employment growth in Texas has exceeded that of the euro zone\nand its two anchors, Germany and France, as well as that of two natural-resource-intensive\ncountries with populations comparable to Texas’, Canada and Australia.\n\n4\n\n\fJob Growth Around the Globe\nTexas\n150\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n\nAustralia\n\n(except euro area, where 100 = July 1990)\n140\n\nCanada\n130\n\nU.S.\n120\n\nEuro area\nFrance\nGermany\nU.K.\n\n110\n\nJapan\n\n100\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\nA t li\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nNow, is all this just prototypical Texas brag, or are there lessons the nation can learn from the\nsuccess that is enjoyed here? Texans are hardly given to modesty, but I believe there are some\nundeniable lessons being imparted here.\nOne lesson I draw from comparative state data is that monetary policy is a necessary but\ninsufficient tonic for economic recovery. The Fed has made money cheap and abundant for the\nentire country. The citizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate under the\nsame monetary policy as do our fellow Americans. We have the same mortgage rates and pay the\nsame rates of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and our businesses borrow at the same\ninterest rates as their brethren elsewhere in the country. Which raises an important question: If\nmonetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the United States, why does Texas\noutperform the other states?\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that Texas is blessed with a comparatively great\namount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and what some claim are\nother “unfair” advantages.\nBut many of these “unfair” advantages are man-made: They derive from a deliberate approach\nby state and local authorities to enact business-friendly regulations and fiscal policy. For\nexample, if you examine the differences between Texas and two states that have been\nunderperforming for a prolonged period—California and New York—you will note that these\nformer power states have less-flexible labor rules. Due to local taxes, differences in zoning\npractices and myriad other factors, the cost of housing and the overall cost of living in California\nand New York are significantly higher than they are here. And due to differences in policies\ngoverning education, the scores measuring middle-school students’ proficiency in math are lower\nin both California and New York than they are in Texas, and in reading, are lower in California\nand only slightly higher in New York.5\n5\n\n\fTaken together, these factors, alongside whatever natural advantages we may enjoy (though it is\nhard to compete with the physical beauty of California and the Great Lakes region or the cultural\nsplendor of New York), affect where firms choose to locate and hire and where people choose to\nraise their families and seek jobs.\nI would argue that an additional factor favors Texas: We have a Legislature that under both\nDemocratic and Republican governors has over time deliberately crafted laws and regulations,\nand tax and spending regimes, encouraging business formation and job creation.\nJust last month, Fairfield, Calif.-based vehicle reseller Copart Inc. announced that it will move its\nheadquarters to Texas, citing “greater operational efficiencies.”6 The CEO for the owner of\nHardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants, Andy Puzder, claims it takes six months to two years to\nsecure permits in California to build a new Carl’s Jr., whereas in Texas, it takes six weeks. These\ntwo anecdotes from California alone clearly illustrate that firms and jobs will go to where it is\neasiest to do business—not where it is less convenient and more costly.\nBoth state and federal authorities need to bear this in mind as they plot changes in the fiscal and\nregulatory policy needed to restore the job-creating engine of America. As an official of the\nFederal Reserve charged with making monetary policy for the country as a whole, I am\nconstantly mindful that investment and job-creating capital is free to roam not only within the\nUnited States, but to any place on earth where it will earn the best risk-adjusted return. If other\ncountries with stable governments offer more attractive tax and regulatory environments, capital\nthat would otherwise go to creating jobs in the U.S.A. will migrate abroad, just as intra-U.S.\ninvestment is migrating to Texas.\nThus, even if one were to somehow have 100 percent certainty about the future course of Federal\nReserve policy and be completely comfortable with it, without greater clarity about the future\ncourse of fiscal and regulatory policy and whether that policy will be competitive in a globalized\nworld, job-creating investment in the U.S. will remain restrained and our great economic\npotential will remain unrealized.\nI pull no punches here: We have been thrown way off course by congresses populated by\ngenerations of Democrats and Republicans who failed the nation by not budgeting ways to cover\nthe costs of their munificent spending with adequate revenue streams. The thrust of the political\ndebate is now—and must continue to be—how to right the listing fiscal ship and put it back on a\ncourse that encourages job formation and gets the economy steaming again toward ever-greater\nprosperity. No amount of monetary accommodation can substitute for the need for responsible\nhands to take ahold of the fiscal helm. Indeed, if we at the Fed were to abandon our wits and seek\nto do so by inflating away the debts and unfunded liabilities of Congress, we would only become\naccomplices to scuttling the economy.\nI was in Mexico last week. Mexico has many problems, not the least of which is declining oil\nproduction, low school graduation rates and drug-induced violence. But on the fiscal front, the\ncountry is outperforming the United States. Mexico’s government has developed and\nimplemented better macroeconomic policy than has the U.S. government.\n\n6\n\n\fMexico’s economy contracted sharply during the global downturn, with real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) plummeting 6.2 percent in 2009. But growth roared back, up 5.5 percent in 2010\nand 3.9 percent in 2011, with output reaching its prerecession peak after 12 quarters—three\nquarters sooner than in the U.S. Mexico’s industrial production passed its prerecession peak at\nthe end of 2010; ours has yet to do so.\nNow hold on to your seats: Mexico actually has a federal budget! We haven’t had one for almost\nthree years. Furthermore, the Mexican Congress has imposed a balanced-budget rule and the\ndiscipline to go with it, so that even with the deviation from balance allowed under emergencies,\nMexico ran a budget deficit of only 2.5 percent in 2011, compared with 8.7 percent in the U.S.\nMexico’s national debt totals 27 percent of GDP; in the U.S., the debt-to-GDP ratio computed on\na comparable basis was 99 percent in 2011 and is projected to be 106 percent in 2012. Imagine\nthat: The country that many Americans look down upon and consider “undeveloped” is now\nmore fiscally responsible and is growing faster than the United States. What does that say about\nthe fiscal rectitude of the U.S. Congress?\nHere is the point: As demonstrated by the relative and continued, inexorable outperformance by\nTexas—which is affected by the same monetary policy as are all of the other 49 states—the key\nto harnessing the monetary accommodation provided by the Fed lies in the hands of our fiscal\nand regulatory authorities, the Congress working with the executive branch. As demonstrated by\nthe fiscal posture of Mexico, a nation can effect budgetary discipline and still have growth.\nOne might draw two lessons here.\nThe first comes from Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, who from my perspective\nwas spot on when he said, “If you want more private demand, you have to take people’s angst\naway” by having responsible and disciplined fiscal and regulatory policy.7 Clearly, there is less\nangst involved in conducting business in Texas.\nThe second is a broader, macroeconomic truism: that fiscal and regulatory policy either\ncomplements monetary policy or retards its utility as a propellant for job creation. Mexico is\nproof positive that good fiscal policy enhances the effectiveness of thoughtfully conducted\nmonetary policy, which is what the Banco de México—whose independence, incidentally, was\nenshrined by a constitutional amendment in 1994—has delivered under its single mandate of\ninflation control and by applying the tool of inflation targeting.\nI should be injecting some levity into the event, though it is hard to do so when one talks about\nour feckless fiscal authorities. But there are witty people who have found a way to do so. Take a\nlook at this parody of Congress that my staff found on YouTube:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\nThere you have the prevailing modus operandi of our fiscal authorities: pass the bill rather than\nthe American dream to our children. What a sad tale!\nYou asked me to talk about the economy. In a nutshell, my answer is this: Monetary policy\nprovides the fuel for the economic engine that is the United States. We have filled the gas tank\nand then some. And yet businesses will not use that fuel to a degree necessary to realize our jobcreating potential and create a better world for the successor generation of Americans until\n7\n\n\fCongress, working with the executive branch, does the responsible thing and pulls together a tax,\nspending and regulatory program that will induce businesses to step on the accelerator and\nengage the transmission mechanism of job creation so they and the consumers they create\nthrough employment can drive our economy forward.\nNotes\n1\n\nGasoline prices were not a major factor in January’s headline index, at least relative to the normally wild swings\nwe see in the price of gasoline. On a seasonally adjusted basis, gasoline prices increased 0.9 percent in January (not\nannualized) and contributed roughly 0.3 annualized percentage points to the headline rate. Based on weekly data\ncollected by the Department of Energy, the price of gasoline in February is on pace for an increase of 6.3 percent\nover January. Given that the typical seasonal pattern has gasoline’s price falling 1.1 percent in February, we should\nsee a roughly 7.4 percent seasonally adjusted increase when personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data for\nFebruary come out at the end of March. Gasoline alone may end up contributing about 3 annualized percentage\npoints to February’s headline PCE rate. A more thorough discussion can be found here:\nwww.dallasfed.org/data/pce/2012/pce1201.cfm.\n2\nFOMC Greenbook forecast, December 1966.\n3\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the nation went into recession in December 2007 and\ncame out in June 2009. According to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business-Cycle Index, Texas went into the recession in\nAugust 2008 and came out in December 2009.\n4\nTexas compares with some international producers of oil and gas as follows:\n\nWorld\nUnited States\nCanada\nTexas\nNorway\nMexico\n\nCrude +\nnatural gas\nliquids\n(mb/d)\n\nNatural gas\n(trillion cu ft, annual)\n\n84.60\n8.58\n3.38\n2.13\n2.13\n2.95\n\n119.39\n22.47\n6.91\n6.71\n3.85\n1.72\n\nSOURCE: Energy Information Administration.\n5\n\nSee The Nation’s Report Card, http://nationsreportcard.gov.\n“California Auto Parts Company Moving to Texas,” by Steve Brown, Dallas Morning News, Feb. 4, 2012.\n7\n“Q&A: German Finance Minister Takes On Critics,” by Marcus Walker, William Boston and Andreas Kissler,\nWall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 2012.\n6\n\n8\n\n\f"

Fisher\nGracias, Luis [Téllez], por tu amable presentación. Luis y yo hemos sido buenos amigos por\nmuchos años. Es una amistad que valoro profundamente.\nEstoy en México fomentando la estrecha relación y la tradición de consulta e intercambio que el\nBanco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas ha mantenido y disfrutado durante muchos años con el\nBanco de México. En este sentido, estoy muy agradecido con el Gobernador Agustín Carstens\npor la hospitalidad que me ha brindado esta semana. Durante los años de su juventud, Agustín\npasó algún tiempo en el Banco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas, y nosotros sentimos cierto\norgullo en haber contribuído en una pequeña parte a su magnífica carrera. Por muchos años,\nnuestra sucursal de El Paso ha llevado a cabo reuniones binacionales de Juntas de Consejo e\nintercambios informativos con las oficinas regionales del Banco de México. Nuestros\neconomistas han colaborado con sus contrapartes del Banco y han compartido su conocimiento y\nexperiencia sobre indicadores económicos regionales, como la construcción de índices\ncoincidentes estatales. Además, Guillermo Ortíz, predecesor del Gobernador Carstens, es\nmiembro del Consejo de Asesores de nuestro Instituto de Globalización y Política Monetaria.\nPodemos por lo tanto decir que el Banco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas y el Banco de México\ndisfrutan de una relación única y mutuamente beneficiosa. Esa relación se ha enriquecido en los\núltimos días con el intercambio realizado entre el personal de mi equipo y el equipo de Agustín.\nComo Luis y Agustín saben muy bien, existe una dimensión personal en la relación que la\nReserva Federal de Dallas mantiene con el Banco de México. En la década de los años 50 yo me\ncrié aquí en la Ciudad de México y asistí a la escuela primaria en un lugar no muy lejos de aquí.\nEl español fue mi primer idioma en la escuela. Todavía tengo muchos amigos en El Norte\nquienes dicen que hablo el español mejor que el inglés. Pero yo siempre los corrijo diciéndoles,\n“No, no hablo español; ¡hablo puro mexicano!” Así que esta mañana, haré todo lo posible para\nhablarles en “español mexicano” y no en “inglés tejano.”\nAlgo de nostalgia\nDurante la década de 1950, la Ciudad de México era un sitio ideal donde crecer. La ciudad era\nsegura y sus cielos claros; Cantinflas inspiraba las carcajadas en el cine, y Marcelino Pan y Vino,\nnos maravillaba y hacía llorar. La economía mexicana tenía como promedio tasas de crecimiento\nde más del 6 por ciento anual en su producto interno bruto (PIB). El crecimiento anual de la\npoblación superaba el 3 por ciento. Parecíamos vivir una época de oro. El único temor que\nrecuerdo de mi niñez era la disciplina de mis maestros en la escuela quienes, a la menor\ninfracción, me castigaban con reglazos en los nudillos y en las palmas de mis manos.\nEn ese entonces, uno podía transitar por un peso a todo lo largo del Paseo de la Reforma, a\nmenos que escogiera la opción más económica preferida por mis hermanos mayores, Roberto y\nMiguel, de viajar en bicicleta agarrados con una mano de un autobus o un camión, dejándose\n1\n\n\fremolcar a toda velocidad. En aquellos años, un kilo de frijol negro costaba un peso; y un litro de\ngasolina 30 centavos. Hoy día, un kilo de frijoles cuesta 25 pesos y un litro de gasolina 10 pesos.\nAl observar esto, le comenté a mi equipo que me estaba haciendo viejo, o que había habido una\ngran inflación. Ellos me aseguraron que ¡ambas cosas eran ciertas!\nTurbulencia y lecciones aprendidas\nMéxico estaba en buenas condiciones cuando mi familia salió del país en 1959, y continuó así\npor muchos años, hasta que llegaron los turbulentos años setenta.\nEntre 1975 y el año 2000, hubo una crisis tras otra: en 1976, 1982, entre 1985 y 1988 y en 1994.\nLa mayoría de esas crisis coincidían con elecciones presidenciales; los sexenios eran\nnormalmente recibidos con devaluaciones del peso del 40 por ciento o más. El peso se convirtió\nen el síntoma de una macroeconomía enferma y disfuncional.\nEn 1982, México ya no pudo pagar su deuda externa, lo cual ocasionó una fuga de capitales,\ndevaluaciones recurrentes y una inflación elevada. Cada crisis dió como resultado un paquete de\nreformas prometidas, las cuales terminaron todas en fracaso, excepto una. En 1986, México\ningresó al Acuerdo General sobre Aranceles y Comercio (GATT, conocido hoy como la\nOrganización Mundial del Comercio o WTO). Más adelante, los esfuerzos por reformar al país\ntomaron impulso bajo la administración del Presidente Salinas, quien inició su presidencia en\n1988. Se privatizaron empresas públicas, se aceleró la desregulación de la industria y se\npromulgaron reformas bancarias. A pesar de ello, esta época terminaría también con una crisis, la\nllamada “crisis del tequila”. Ahora, en retrospectiva, sabemos que los cimientos que se colocaron\nen esa época, y que se desarrollaron durante la administración del Presidente Zedillo y en\nadministraciones subsecuentes, llegarían a transformar las estructuras macroeconómicas de\nMéxico de una manera impresionante.\nEn 1993, después de décadas de tasas de inflación de dos dígitos, fue necesario sustituir el peso\noriginal por uno más nuevo, eliminando tres ceros. El nuevo peso era más delgado y elegante,\npero no tardó en sufrir la misma suerte que el viejo peso. A fin de cuentas, el problema no era el\npeso. El problema consistía en que México tenía un banco central, al cual las autoridades fiscales\nmantenían cautivo. A México lo empobrecía la complicidad del banco central con la mala\nadministración fiscal del gobierno.\nSin un banco central independiente, volvió a surgir el mismo problema crónico: la monetización\nde la deuda gubernamental o, para decirlo en lenguaje más claro, la utilización de la “maquinita\nde imprimir billetes” para pagar deudas. La monetización y el derroche fiscal resultaron en un\nfuerte golpe a los mexicanos. La inflación anual fue en promedio del 15 por ciento en la década\nde los setenta y del 70 por ciento en la de los 80, antes de descender al nivel todavía inaceptable\ndel 20 por ciento en la década de los 90. Los niveles de vida se estancaron y el crecimiento real\nper cápita del producto interno bruto (PIB) se redujo a sólo el 0.7 por ciento anual entre 1981 y el\naño 2000. Éstas fueron, como lo han observado otros, décadas perdidas.\nEso era antes. Esto es ahora: La necesidad de actualizar percepciones\nComo resultado de estas crisis del pasado, hay personas que han desarrollado percepciones\nnegativas de México. Y, como ustedes saben, los estereotipos negativos tardan mucho en\ncambiar. Yo considero que ha llegado el momento de cambiar nuestra perspectiva sobre México.\nHay reformas instituídas y codificadas en la Constitución mexicana, tanto en el frente fiscal\n2\n\n\fcomo en el monetario, que colocan a México en un lugar ejemplar. México ha mejorado mucho\nsu entorno macroeconómico, más que lo que los estereotipos falsos nos quieren hacer creer. La\nrealidad es que en muchas áreas macroeconómicas México se encuentra en una posición superior\na los Estados Unidos.\nEsto puede incomodarle a aquellos estadounidenses acostumbrados a mirar a México a través del\nlente de la inmigración y del tráfico de drogas, o a quienes su percepción benigna de México\nproviene de disfrutar una margarita en sus hermosas playas, como Punta Mita. Como menionaré\nmás adelante, la situación macroeconómica de México es sólida y el país va por el sendero\napropiado para resolver los engorrosos problemas microeconómicos que todavía obstruyen su\nprogreso. En los Estados Unidos ocurre lo opuesto. Desde una perspectiva macroeconómica el\nfuturo de México es prometedor; su potencial continúa mejorando. Desafortunadamente, por los\nproblemas fiscales en mi país, no podemos decir lo mismo de la trayectoria macroeconómica de\nlos Estados Unidos.\nLos tejanos comprenden\nAntes de continuar, quiero mencionar que los tejanos tenemos un alto grado de empatía hacia\nMéxico, no solamente porque tenemos una frontera en común y compartimos una historia única;\no porque los hispanos forman el 35 por ciento de nuestra fuerza laboral y ellos, y sus familias,\nhan impulsado nuestra economía y han enriquecido nuestra cultura; sino porque Texas también\nsufre de estereotipos anticuados a pesar de nuestros logros macroeconómicos. Durante más de\ndos décadas, Texas ha crecido a un ritmo dos veces mayor que el resto de los Estados Unidos,\ncon un crecimiento promedio de empleo del 2 por ciento anual, mientras que el producto interno\nbruto (PIB) nominal per cápita ha superado al del resto de la nación. De hecho, Texas no sólo ha\nestado a la vanguardia en la creación de empleo desde 1990, sino tambien ha superado a muchos\nde los países “avanzados”, desde Alemania, Francia e Reino Unido hasta Australia y Canadá.\nSin embargo con mucha frecuencia (y particularmente durante el breve período en que cierto\nGobernador de Texas aspiraba a la presidencia), muchos de los que se aferran a los viejos\nestereotipos describen a Texas como un estado disfuncional. La realidad refuta esta ficción tanto\nen Texas como en México.\nLa realidad de México\nAsí que, ¿cuál es la verdad acerca de la economía mexicana? Para contestar esta interrogante\npodríamos comenzar por examinar ciertos criterios comparativos en México y los Estados\nUnidos.\nPor ejemplo, vale la pena observar que México se recuperó con mayor rapidez de la Gran\nRecesión y de la crisis financiera global. La actividad económica de México se contrajo de\nmanera brusca y profunda en 2009 con una caída del 6.2 por ciento en términos reales. Pero su\nproducto interno bruto real se recuperó con gran rapidez, creciendo en un 5.5 por ciento en el\n2010 y un 3.9 por ciento en el 2011, para alcanzar su pico previo a la recesión después de 12\ntrimestres. En los Estados Unidos la recuperación demoró 15 trimestres, o sea casi un año más,\nantes de que su producto interno bruto retornara a los niveles previos a la recesión.\nLa producción industrial de los Estados Unidos no ha alcanzado todavía los niveles previos a la\nrecesión, mientras que la producción industrial de México sobrepasó su pico anterior a la\nrecesión a fines del 2010.\n3\n\n\fPolítica fiscal\nEn el ámbito fiscal, podría ser sorprendente para las autoridades fiscales de mi país que ¡México\ncuenta realmente con un presupuesto federal! Y a ustedes les puede sorprender que el gobierno\nde los Estados Unidos no haya podido aprobar un presupuesto durante tres años consecutivos.1\nEs más, en 2011, México tuvo un déficit presupuestario equivalente a 2.5 por ciento del producto\ninterno bruto, comparado con un déficit del 8.7 por ciento en los Estados Unidos. La deuda\nnacional de México es pequeña, alrededor del 27 por ciento de su producto interno bruto; en el\n2011, la razón deuda-producto interno bruto de los Estados Unidos fue el 99 por ciento y está\nproyectada que será del 106 por ciento en el 2012, cuando la deuda nacional excederá los $16\nbillones de dólares.2\nMéxico posee una herramienta que obliga al gobierno a adherirse a una disciplina fiscal. Desde\nel 2006, ustedes han adoptado la regla de un presupuesto equilibrado. Fue parte de las reformas\nde la Ley Federal de Presupuesto y Responsabilidad Hacendaria, aprobada por el Congreso de la\nUnión. Las desviaciones de la regla se permiten sólo en emergencias. Por consiguiente, aún al\nocurrir la situación de emergencia que provocó una desviación de la regla durante la Gran\nRecesión y la crisis financiera global, el déficit del presupuesto de México, como porcentaje de\nsu producto interno bruto, fue menos de la cuarta parte del déficit fiscal de los Estados Unidos.\nEsto es un hecho: Su gobierno ha puesto en marcha una disciplina fiscal mucho mejor que la de\nmi gobierno, y lo ha hecho de tal forma que no ha obstruído la recuperación económica.\nAl comenzar mis comentarios, mencioné a Cantinflas. Era el maestro del chiste—ya sea que se\ntratara de una pirueta cómica o de un juego de palabras, con frecuencia dirigido en contra del\ngobierno. Las reformas fiscales del gobierno mexicano no tienen nada de humorístico; por el\ncontrario, han sido reformas serias con un impacto significativo. En contraste, los politicos y los\nforjadores de las políticas norteamericanas han demostrado su incapacidad para llevar a cabo una\nreforma fiscal. Las autoridades fiscales de los Estados Unidos no han logrado determinar la\nmanera de estructurar y poner en práctica un presupuesto que restaure la confianza, que controle\nlos déficits nacionales a largo plazo y las obligaciones contrapartidas de ingresos para fomentar\nal mismo tiempo la inversión, la creación de empleo y la toma de riesgo. El Congreso de los\nEstados Unidos, y los aspirantes a la presidencia en el 2012, podrían beneficiarse con una visión\nmás amplia de México. En vez de enfocarse exclusivamente en la inmigración ilegal y el tráfico\nde drogas y de armas ―no obstante la importancia de estos temas― deberían pedirle prestado a\nMéxico su manual de disciplina fiscal.\nAsuntos monetarios\nAl abordar el tema de los asuntos monetarios, es necesario mencionar que en años recientes el\npeso ha sido muy volátil, respondiendo a las fuerzas de mercado que actúan sobre una moneda\nque ahora flota libremente. Antes de la crisis financiera, el tipo de cambio promedio era de\naproximadamente 11 pesos por dólar; desde el 2009, el promedio ha sido más o menos de 13\npesos por dólar. El año pasado sólo entre los meses de julio a diciembre el peso se depreció en un\n15 por ciento, pero desde entonces ha vuelto a apreciarse ligeramente frente al dólar. Es notable,\nsin embargo, que la relación entre la fluctuación del peso y la inflación ha sido débil y temporal.\nLa inflación fue del 3.6 por ciento en el 2009, aumentó al 4.4 por ciento en el 2010, y se redujo\nluego al 3.8 por ciento en el 2011. Esto está dentro de los parámetros de objetivos de inflación\n4\n\n\festablecidos por el Banco de México y es comparable al ritmo de inflación del 3.0 por ciento en\nlos Estados Unidos el año pasado, de acuerdo al índice de precios al consumidor (CPI).\nYo atribuyo el control de la inflación a la reforma de 1993 que convirtió al Banco de México en\nun banco central independiente y a la adopción en el 2001 de un régimen de inflación objetivo.\nAntes de la creación de un banco central independiente, la inflación de México tenía una tasa\nanual promedio de 43 por ciento; después de esta reforma, la inflación cayó al 11 por ciento; y\ndesde el establecimiento del régimen de inflación objetivo, la tasa promedio de la inflación\ndescendió al 4.4 por ciento anual.\nEs importante observar que a medida que gana experiencia y la credibilidad en la\nimplementación de un régimen de inflación objetivo, un banco central puede influir sobre las\nexpectativas de inflación. El Banco de México parece haber logrado esto con éxito, como lo\ndemuestra que la tasa de inflación objetivo pasó de ser 6.5 por ciento en el 2001 a sólo 3 por\nciento en la actualidad.\nComo resultado de estos cambios importantes, el peso es ahora un repositorio de valor y ya no es\nrechazado como una divisa enfermiza. La dedicación del banco central a una tasa de inflación\nbaja a corto y a largo plazo ha contribuído, con el tiempo, al desarrollo de un mercado de bonos\ndenominado en pesos y al descenso de las tasas de interés de la deuda pública.\nAntes de 1995, la curva de rendimiento mexicana se extendía a… ¡27 días! Los Certificados de\nla Tesorería de la Federación, los CETES, eran el único tipo de emisión existente. En 1995, el\ngobierno mexicano comenzó a desarrollar progresivamente una mejor curva de rendimiento. En\nese año emitió notas bancarias con una madurez de hasta un año; en el año 2000 esta madurez se\nextendió a cinco años; en el 2004 la emisión de bonos alcanzó 20 años y en el 2006 fue de 30\naños. Las tasas de interés han caído con cada emisión subsecuente. Tan sólo en enero de este\naño, México emitió $2,000 millones en bonos a 10 años denominados en pesos, con un\nrendimiento del 3.7 por ciento anual y una relación oferta-demanda de dos y medio a uno. Ésta\nha sido la tasa más baja que el gobierno ha obtenido en este plazo, cuyo inventario es de $247\nmil millones de pesos.\nOtra nota sobre la deuda mexicana: el indicador de mercado que mide el riesgo de crédito de\nMéxico (CDS) se ha mantenido en niveles bajos y recientemente se encuentra por debajo del de\nFrancia (¡al final, revancha contra Maximiliano!).\nLa realidad es que las reformas de la política monetaria de México han comenzado a rendir\nfrutos respecto a la inflación y el costo de la deuda.\nEn cuanto al ámbito monetario, considero que es justo decir que la comparación con México es\nmás favorable para los Estados Unidos que en el ámbito fiscal. En la última reunión del Comité\nFederal de Mercado Abierto celebrada en enero, la Reserva Federal adoptó formalmente un\nobjetivo de inflación a largo plazo del 2 por ciento. Declaramos al mismo tiempo que aunque\nnosotros tenemos un doble mandato, a diferencia del Banco de México, no estábamos en\ncondiciones de ofrecer un objetivo numérico de empleo porque factores “no monetarios” tienen\ntanta o más influencia sobre la dinámica del empleo que la política monetaria. Personalmente,\nconsidero que ésta es una señal importante para que nuestras autoridades fiscales comprendan\n5\n\n\fque no pueden esperar que la inflación las absuelva de la obligación que tienen de instituir las\nreformas fiscales y regulatorias necesarias para restaurar un crecimiento sostenible del empleo.\nEsta vez no fue México…\nApuesto que cada uno de ustedes recuerda la puntada de Guillermo Ortiz durante la reunión en\nDavos de 2008: “Esta vez no fuimos nosotros”. No fueron ustedes en gran parte debido a la\ninversión hecha por el gobierno mexicano en reformas fiscales y monetarias. Estas reformas no\nhan sido perfectas. Todavía hay mucho por hacer. Pero México ha logrado grandes avances.\nUstedes han avanzado bastante en la apertura comercial después de ingresar al Acuerdo General\nsobre Aranceles Aduaneros y Comercio (GATT) en 1986. Ratificaron el Tratado de Libre\nComercio de América del Norte (TLCAN) en 1994. Desde entonces, hasta donde yo tengo\nconocimiento, el gobierno mexicano ha implementado por lo menos 13 acuerdos de comercio\ncon 45 naciones y está negociando en la actualidad acuerdos adicionales con Corea del Sur y\nBrasil.\nLa apertura del comercio ha beneficiado al pueblo mexicano. Los aranceles promedio han bajado\ndesde el 27 por ciento en 1982 al 1.3 por ciento en el 2001, beneficiando a los consumidores y a\nlos productores mexicanos. Y tanto el volumen como la composición del comercio exterior\nmexicano se han transformado de manera significativa. En 1980, el comercio, como porcentaje\ndel producto interno bruto, era de sólo el 17.5 por ciento; hoy las exportaciones e importaciones\nmexicanas equivalen al 62 por ciento de la producción económica del país. En 1980, el petróleo\nrepresentaba el 58 por ciento de las exportaciones de México; hoy día representa solamente el 16\npor ciento. Gracias a la evolución de una industria manufacturera de clase mundial,\naproximadamente el 80 por ciento de las exportaciones de México son productos\nmanufacturados.\n… Pero queda todavía más por hacer\nEn cuanto al desarrollo de la economía interna, el país ha progresado pero todavía queda mucho\npor hacer. Yo espero que ustedes le permitan a un vecino amigable señalar algunas de sus\ninquietudes.\nLa buena noticia es que a fines de la década de los 80 y comienzos de la década de los 90, más\nde 1,000 empresas públicas de México fueron privatizadas. Pero el éxito de la privatización ha\nsido mixto. La privatización bancaria originó inicialmente una crisis financiera y un costoso\nrescate, aunque ahora el sistema bancario mexicano opera sobre cimientos más firmes. Los\nbancos mexicanos demostraron su capacidad y fortaleza de recuperación durante la reciente\ncrisis financiera global. La mayoría de los bancos mexicanos han puesto en práctica las normas\nde capital de Basel 3. Al otro extremo del espectro, la desregulación de la industria telefónica, no\nha sido exitosa. Ha dado como resultado un monopolio de los medios de telecomunicación que\ncontinúa hasta ahora siendo un impedimento estructural significativo para el desarrollo de la\neconomía mexicana. En un informe reciente, la Organización para la Cooperación y el\nDesarrollo Económico (OECD) estima que la falta de competencia en el sector de las\ncomunicaciones produjo pérdidas de bienestar de $129.2 mil millones de dólares entre los años\n2005 y 2009, una pérdida equivalente al 1.8 por ciento del producto interno bruto de México.3\nMe preocupa también la capacidad futura del gobierno mexicano para financiar sus necesidades\nen una era de producción petrolera en declive. Como es del conocimiento de ustedes, los\n6\n\n\fingresos petroleros representan el 34 por ciento de los ingresos públicos, mientras que la\nproducción del petróleo crudo ha caído un 25 por ciento desde su nivel pico del año 2004, hasta\nun nuevo mínimo de sólo 2.5 millones de barriles diarios. Mientras tanto, sin el petróleo, los\nimpuestos como parte del producto interno bruto se encuentran entre los niveles más bajos de\nAmérica Latina, a pesar de los mejores esfuerzos del gobierno actual por aumentar los ingresos\nfiscales. Es importante que se puedan encontrar nuevas maneras de mantener un presupuesto\nnacional equilibrado como lo exige el Congreso, y poder lograrlo sin asfixiar el crecimiento\neconómico.\nUna inquietud que tengo acerca del potencial del crecimiento de la economía mexicana a largo\nplazo es que en las estadísticas compiladas por la Organización para la Cooperación y el\nDesarrollo Económico (OECD) México aparece penúltimo en tasas de graduación de la escuela\npreparatoria. Sólo el 45 por ciento de los estudiantes mexicanos que se matriculan en la escuela\npreparatoria o su equivalente se gradúan. Mientras tanto, un cuarto de todos los mexicanos entre\nlas edades de 15 y 29 años no asisten a la escuela y no participan en la fuerza laboral. Cuando la\ngente joven no va a la escuela ni trabaja, existe con mucha frecuencia la posibilidad de\ninestabilidad social y actividad criminal.\nMe parte el alma ver que la violencia continúa siendo una plaga en esta gran nación. La mayoría\nde las empresas en el corazón industrial del norte de México informan que han sido afectadas\ndirectamente por el crimen organizado. Esto pone a prueba la determinación de inversionistas\npotenciales e induce a ciertas familias prominentes mexicanas a trasladar sus familias y sus\nnegocios a Texas y a otros estados de los Estados Unidos. Es una situación que drena el capital\nintelectual y la productividad de México, algo que el país no puede darse el lujo de perder.\nTodos estos factores y otros, como las prácticas monopolísticas en el sector de las\ntelecomunicaciones, restringen el progreso y la productividad que deben surgir de los grandes\navances macroeconómicos logrados por México.\nAl puntualizar esta problemática no es mi propósito ofender a mis compadres mexicanos. Estoy\nsimplemente señalando que la reforma macroeconómica es una condición necesaria pero\ninsuficiente para el progreso económico. Es imprescindible hacer valer las leyes, crear un\nsistema educativo mejor y eliminar las barreras que obstaculizan la plena utilización del capital\nhumano, físico y financiero del país para que el triunfo de las reformas macroeconómicas haga\ncristalizar un bienestar y un futuro mejor para la nación mexicana.\nConclusión\nAunque la tarea de mejorar la vida del pueblo mexicano está muy lejos de haberse completado,\nha llegado el momento de descartar los viejos estereotipos y dar a las autoridades fiscales y\nmonetarias de México el crédito que se merecen. A quienes dudaron de la capacidad de México\npara adoptar reformas, abandonar métodos obsoletos y adoptar métodos nuevos, yo quisiera\nsugerir que el desempeño de la economía mexicana durante y desde la reciente crisis financiera\ndebe ser suficiente para aplacar sus temores. La rápida recuperación de México en todas las áreas\nde sus sectores macroeconómicos y financieros es una prueba positiva de que los sacrificios de la\nreforma valieron la pena. Me aventuro a decir que hay lecciones que aprender de esta\nexperiencia, lecciones para los Estados Unidos e inclusive para Europa. Los logros de México se\nhan alcanzado a través de reformas monetarias y fiscales. Estas reformas han trabajado en\n7\n\n\farmonía para crear el modelo de una macroeconomía estable y vigorosa. Para los mexicanos esto\ndebe ser motivo de orgullo. Y para otras naciones, inclusive la mía, motivo de inspiración.\nNotas\n1\nAunque no ha habido una resolución presupuestaria durante tres años, las agencias\ngubernamentales han recibido financiamiento a través de comités de apropiaciones.\n2\nLas cifras de la deuda federal de los Estados Unidos aquí citadas se refieren a la “Deuda\nFederal Bruta”, que incluye prácticamente toda la deuda emitida por el gobierno de ese país.\nIncluye tanto deuda en manos de agencias gubernamentales, tales como bonos del Tesoro en la\ncartera de inversiones del Sistema de Seguridad Social (Social Security Trust Fund), como deuda\nen manos del sector privado. Esta medida es comparable, por lo tanto, a la deuda federal bruta de\nMéxico.\n3\nOECD (2012), OECD Review of Telecommunication Policy and Regulation in Mexico, OECD\nPublishing.

Fisher\nThank you, Luis [Téllez], for that kind introduction. Luis and I have been good friends for many\nyears, and I delight in our friendship.\nI am in Mexico fostering the close relationship and tradition of consultation and exchange that\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has enjoyed over the years with the Banco de México. In this\nregard, I am especially grateful to Governor Agustín Carstens for his hospitality this week.\nAgustín spent some time at the Dallas Fed when he was a young man, and we take pride in this\nbeing a small part of his accomplished career. For many years, the Dallas Fed’s El Paso Branch\nhas held joint board meetings and informational exchanges with the regional offices of the Banco\nde México. Our economists have worked with their counterparts at the Banco to share expertise\non regional economic indicators, such as the construction of state coincident indexes. And\nGovernor Carstens’ predecessor, Guillermo Ortiz, is an Advisory Board member of the Dallas\nFed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. So it is fair to say that the Federal Reserve\nBank of Dallas and the Banco de México enjoy a unique and mutually beneficial relationship.\nThat relationship has been enriched by the last few days’ exchange between my team and\nAgustín’s.\nAs Luis and Agustín well know, there is a personal dimension to the Dallas Fed’s relationship\nwith the Banco de México. I grew up here in Mexico City in the 1950s and attended an\nelementary school not far from this very spot. Spanish was my first language in school; to this\nday, I have many friends in El Norte who say I speak better Spanish than I do English. But I\nalways correct their assertion by saying, “No, no hablo Español; hablo puro Mexicano!” So this\nmorning, I will do my level best to speak to you in “Español Mexicano” rather than in “Ingles\nTexano.”\nA Bit of Nostalgia\nIn the 1950s, Mexico City was an ideal place to grow up. The city was safe; the skies were clear;\nCantinflas inspired laughter for every moviegoer and Marcelino Pan y Vino, wonderment and\ntears. The Mexican economy was averaging GDP growth rates over 6 percent a year, and the\npopulation was growing over 3 percent per year. It seemed a golden era. The only fear I can\nrecall as a child was of the stern teachers at school who would take a ruler to my knuckles or the\npalms of my hands at the slightest infraction.\nBack then, you could transit the entire length of “Avenida Reforma” in a taxi for one peso,\nunless you took the cheaper option preferred by my older brothers―Bob and Mike―of riding a\nbicycle alongside a speeding bus or truck, latching on to it with one hand and having it tow you\nalong, at breakneck speed. Then, a kilo of black beans cost one peso; a liter of gasoline, 30\ncentavos. Today, you pay 25 pesos for a kilo of beans and 10 pesos for a liter of gas. Noting this,\n\n1\n\n\fI suggested to my staff that either I am getting old or there has been a great deal of inflation in\nthe interim. They responded that I was correct on both fronts!\nTurbulence and Lessons Learned\nMexico was in good shape when my family left in 1959 and would continue to do well for many\nmore years, until the turbulent 1970s.\nBetween 1975 and 2000, there was one crisis after another: in 1976, 1982, 1985–88 and 1994.\nMost of those crises corresponded with national elections; presidential sexenios (six-year terms)\nwere routinely welcomed with peso devaluations of 40 percent or more. The peso became the\nsymptom of the diseased and dysfunctional macroeconomy.\nIn 1982, Mexico defaulted on its external debt, resulting in capital flight, continuing devaluations\nand soaring inflation. Each crisis resulted in a package of promised reforms, but they all ended in\nfailure—except one. In 1986, Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT—now the World Trade Organization, or WTO). Reform efforts then accelerated under\nPresident Salinas, who took office in 1988. Privatization of public firms and industry\nderegulation picked up pace, and banking reforms were enacted. Notwithstanding, this era would\nalso end with a crisis―the Tequila Crisis. But now, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that\nthe foundations then being laid―and built upon by President Zedillo’s and subsequent\nadministrations―would transform Mexico’s macroeconomic structures in a most impressive\nway.\nIn 1993, after decades of double-digit inflation, the old peso had to be replaced with a younger\nmodel with three fewer zeros. The new peso was slimmer and trimmer, but it soon suffered the\nsame fate as the old peso. After all, it wasn’t the peso that was the problem. The problem was\nthat Mexico had a central bank that was held captive by the fiscal authorities. Mexico was\nimpoverished by the central bank’s complicity with the government’s fiscal mismanagement.\nWithout an independent central bank, there arose the age-old problem―the monetization of the\ngovernment’s debt, or, in plain language, running the printing press to pay the bills. Monetization\nof fiscal profligacy struck Mexicans hard. Annual inflation averaged 15 percent in the 1970s and\n70 percent in the 1980s, before descending to a still punishing level of 20 percent in the 1990s.\nLiving standards stagnated as growth in real GDP per capita slowed to just 0.7 percent per\nannum between 1981 and 2000. These were, as others have noted, lost decades.\nThat Was Then. This Is Now: Time to Update Perceptions\nAs a result of these past crises, some people have negative perceptions of Mexico. And negative\nstereotypes take a long time to change. I believe it is time to change our perspective on Mexico.\nReforms have been instituted and codified in your constitution that, on both the fiscal and\nmonetary front, place Mexico on an exemplary plane. Not only is Mexico doing better,\nmacroeconomically speaking, than the false stereotypes would have us think, Mexico is actually\ndoing better than the United States in many macroeconomic areas.\nThis may come as a shock to those Americans who tend to look at Mexico solely through the\nlens of immigration or drug trafficking, or whose most benign perception of Mexico is gleaned\nfrom lying on a beautiful beach sipping a margarita in Punta Mita. As I will note in a moment,\nMexico is macroeconomically sound and is moving in the right direction to address the vexing\n2\n\n\fmicroeconomic problems that still hold your country back. In the United States, the opposite is\nthe case. From a macroeconomic standpoint, Mexico’s future is bright; its prospects keep\nimproving. Sadly, one cannot say the same about the present macroeconomic trajectory of El\nNorte.\nLos Tejanos Comprenden\nBefore proceeding, I might mention that Texans have a great deal of empathy for Mexico, not\njust because we share a common border and a unique, shared history. Or because Hispanics are\n35 percent of our labor force and they and their families have energized our economy and\nenriched our culture. It is because Texas also suffers from outdated stereotypes despite our\nmacroeconomic record. For over two decades, Texas has grown about twice as fast as the rest of\nthe United States, with job growth averaging 2 percent per year, while nominal GDP per capita\nhas caught up with and surpassed that of the nation. Indeed, Texas not only has led the nation in\nemployment growth since 1990, but also has outpaced many of the “advanced”\ncountries―ranging from Germany, France and the United Kingdom to Australia and Canada.\nYet more often than not (and especially during the brief period when a certain Texas governor\naspired to be president), many who cling to old stereotypes depict Texas in terms befitting a\ndysfunctional state. The truth about Texas belies that fiction, just as it does with Mexico.\nThe Facts About Mexico\nSo what is the truth about the Mexican economy? We might start by examining some\ncomparative metrics between Mexico and the United States.\nFor example, it is noteworthy that Mexico has recovered more rapidly from the Great Recession\nand the global financial crisis. To be sure, Mexico’s real output contracted sharply and deeply\nwith GDP plummeting 6.2 percent in 2009. But real GDP roared back, growing 5.5 percent in\n2010 and then 3.9 percent in 2011, and reaching its prerecession peak after 12 quarters. It took\nthe U.S. 15 quarters, or almost an additional year, before GDP was back to its prerecession level.\nU.S. industrial production is still not back to prerecession levels, but Mexico’s industrial\nproduction passed its prerecession peak at the end of 2010.\nFiscal Policy\nOn the fiscal front, it might surprise fiscal authorities in El Norte that Mexico actually has a\nfederal budget! And it might surprise you to know that the U.S. government has not agreed on a\nbudget for three years running.1 Furthermore, Mexico ran a budget deficit of 2.5 percent in 2011,\ncompared with the U.S. figure of 8.7 percent. Mexico’s national debt is small, at 27 percent of\nGDP; in 2011, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 99 percent and is projected to be 106 percent in\n2012 as the national debt passes $16 trillion.2\nMexico has a tool that forces the government to hew to fiscal discipline. Since 2006, you have\nhad a balanced budget rule, passed into law by your Congress. Deviations are only allowed in\nemergencies. Thus, even with the emergency situation that triggered a deviation from balance\nduring the Great Recession and global financial crisis, Mexico’s budget deficit as a percentage of\nGDP was less than one-quarter that of the United States.\n\n3\n\n\fThis is a fact: Your government has implemented greater fiscal discipline than mine and has\ndone so in a way that has not hampered economic recovery.\nI started this speech mentioning Cantinflas. He was the master of the chiste—the joke, be it a\nsight gag or a funny line, often directed at the government. The Mexican government’s fiscal\nreforms have been anything but jokes; they have been serious reforms with a significant impact.\nIn contrast, American politicians and policymakers have proven incapable of fiscal reform. U.S.\nfiscal authorities have not gotten their act together to figure out how to construct and implement\na budget that restores confidence by reeling in the nation’s long-term deficits and unfunded\nliabilities while encouraging investment, job creation and risk taking. The Congress of the\nUnited States, and those who aspire to the presidency in 2012, might well benefit by broadening\ntheir perspective on Mexico from focusing solely on illegal immigration and drug and gun\ntrafficking―important as those issues are―and take a chapter from Mexico’s book about\nimplementing real fiscal reform.\nMonetary Matters\nTurning to monetary matters, it must be noted that the peso has been volatile in recent years,\nresponsive to market forces acting on a currency which now freely floats. Before the financial\ncrisis, it averaged about 11 pesos to the dollar; since 2009, it has averaged about 13 pesos to the\ndollar. Last year, it depreciated by 15 percent from July to December alone, but has since\nappreciated slightly against the dollar. What is striking, however, is that the pass-through of the\npeso’s weakness into inflation has been muted and temporary. Inflation was 3.6 percent in 2009,\nrose to 4.4 percent in 2010 then retreated to 3.8 percent in 2011. This is within the bands of the\nBanco de México’s inflation target. By comparison, the pace of inflation realized in the United\nStates last year was 3.0 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nI attribute this muting of inflation to the reform that made the Banco de México an independent\ncentral bank in 1993 and to the adoption of explicit inflation targeting in 2001.\nPre-central bank independence, Mexico’s inflation averaged a 43 percent annual rate; postindependence, this fell to 11 percent; since inflation targeting was implemented, the average\ninflation rate has fallen further to 4.4 percent per year.\nIt is important to note that as experience and credibility are gathered in the exercise of inflation\nrate targeting, a central bank can influence inflation expectations. The Banco de México appears\nto have done this successfully. The inflation target has been ratcheted downward: It was 6.5\npercent in 2001; now it is 3 percent.\nAs a result of these important changes, the peso is now a store of value and not shunned as the\nfinancial leper it once was. The central bank’s short- and long-run commitments to low inflation\nhave, over time, led to the development of a peso-denominated bond market and falling interest\nrates on government debt.\nPrevious to 1995, the Mexican yield curve ran all the way out to … 27 days! Cetes were the only\nform of issuance. In 1995, the Mexican government began to progressively build a yield curve.\nThat year it issued notes up to one year in maturity; in 2000, notes up to five years; in 2004,\nbonds up to 20 years; and in 2006, 30-year bonds. Interest rates have fallen on each successive\nissue. In January, Mexico issued $2 billion in peso denominated 10-year bonds, yielding 3.7\n4\n\n\fpercent and a bid-to-coverage ratio of 2½ to 1. This was the lowest rate the government has\nobtained for this maturity for which there is now 247 billion Mexican pesos outstanding.\nAnother note on Mexico’s debt: the market indicator that measures Mexico’s country risk (CDS\nspreads) has remained at low levels and, as of October 2011, fell below that of France (finally,\nrevenge on Maximiliano!).\nThe point is that with regard to both inflation and cost of debt, Mexico’s monetary policy\nreforms are beginning to pay off.3\nOn the monetary front, I believe it is fair to say that the United States compares more favorably\nthan on the fiscal front. At the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in January,\nthe Federal Reserve formally adopted a long-term inflation target of 2 percent. Simultaneously,\nwe stated that though we have a dual mandate, unlike the Banco de México, we could not\nprovide a numerical target for employment because “nonmonetary” factors have as much or\nmore influence on employment dynamics as does monetary policy. I personally consider this an\nimportant signal to our fiscal authorities that they cannot expect inflation to absolve them of their\nduty―the need to institute fiscal and regulatory reforms necessary to restore sustainable\nemployment growth.\nThis Time It Wasn’t Mexico…\nI’ll bet that everyone in this room can recall Guillermo Ortiz’s quip in Davos in 2008: “This time\nit wasn’t us.” It wasn’t you in significant part because of your government’s investment in fiscal\nand monetary reform. These reforms have not been perfect. Much work remains to be done. But\nMexico has come far.\nYou have gone laudably far with trade liberalization since joining GATT in 1986. You ratified\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. Your government has since\nimplemented at least 13 trade agreements with 45 nations that I am aware of and is currently\nnegotiating additional trade agreements with South Korea and Brazil.\nTrade liberalization has benefited the Mexican people. Average tariffs fell from 27 percent in\n1982 to 1.3 percent in 2001, benefiting Mexican consumers and manufacturers. And the volume\nand composition of Mexican trade has changed significantly. In 1980, trade as a percentage of\nGDP was only 17.5 percent; today exports and imports are equivalent to 62 percent of economic\noutput. In 1980, oil accounted for 58 percent of Mexico’s exports; today it accounts for only 16\npercent. Thanks to the evolution of Mexico’s world class manufacturing industry, some 80\npercent of Mexico’s exports are now manufactured goods.\n… Yet There Is More to Do\nAs to the opening up of the domestic economy, some progress has been made but much remains\nto be done. I hope you will allow a friendly neighbor to point out some concerns.\nThe good news is that around 1,000 plus Mexican public companies were deregulated in the late\n1980s and early 1990s. Yet deregulation has been a mixed success. Banking privatization\nresulted initially in a banking crisis and expensive bailout, though now the Mexican banking\nsystem is on firmer footing. Mexican banks proved resilient during the recent global financial\ncrisis. The majority of Mexican banks have capital levels that allow them to fully comply with\n5\n\n\fBasel III capital regulation. Telephone deregulation, on the other end of the spectrum, has not\nbeen a success. It has resulted in a telecom monopoly that to this day remains a significant\nstructural impediment to Mexican economic development. In a recent report, the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that lack of competition in the\ncommunication sector led to welfare losses of $129.2 billion from 2005 to 2009, a loss\nequivalent to 1.8 percent of Mexico GDP.4\nI also worry about the future ability of the Mexican government to fund itself in an era of\ndeclining oil production. As you know, oil revenues have accounted for 34 percent of public\nrevenue, while crude oil production has declined 25 percent from its 2004 peak to new lows of\njust 2.5 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, without oil, taxes as a share of GDP are still among the\nlowest in Latin America, despite the current government’s bold efforts to increase tax revenue.\nNew ways may have to be found to maintain the balanced budget your Congress demands and to\ndo so without choking off economic growth.\nOne concern that I have about Mexico’s long-term growth prospects is that Mexico ranks second\nto last in the OECD in high school completion rates; only 45 percent of Mexican students who\nenroll in upper secondary school graduate. Meanwhile, fully one-quarter of all Mexicans aged 15\nto 29 are neither in school nor in the labor force. When young people are not in school or at\nwork, more often than not there exists a potential for social instability and criminal activity to\nensue.\nIt breaks my heart that violence continues to plague this great nation. The majority of companies\nin your industrial heartland in Northern Mexico report they have been directly affected by\norganized crime. This is testing the resolve of would-be investors, and inducing some prominent\nMexicans to move their families and their businesses to Texas and elsewhere up north. This is a\nbrain and productivity drain Mexico can hardly afford.\nAll of this and more, such as the monopolistic practices in the communications sector, restrain\nMexican progress and productivity that should ensue from the great macroeconomic strides that\nyou have made.\nI do not wish to offend mis compadres Mexicanos by pointing to these problematic issues. I am\nsimply making the point that macroeconomic reform is a necessary but insufficient condition for\neconomic progress. The rule of law, making for practicable education and removing\nimpediments to a fulsome deployment of human, physical and financial capital are necessary to\nmake hard-won macroeconomic reforms result in the improved welfare of the Mexican nation.\nConclusion\nWhile the work of improving the lot of the Mexican people is far from complete, it is time to\ndiscard old stereotypes of Mexico and give the fiscal and monetary authorities here credit where\ncredit is due. To those who doubted Mexico’s ability to reform, to cast off the old and embrace\nthe new, I would like to suggest that the performance of the Mexican economy during and since\nthe recent financial crisis should be enough to allay their fears. Mexico’s rapid recovery in all\ndimensions of its macroeconomy and financial sector is proof positive that the gain from reform\nis worth the pain. I would go so far as to say there are lessons to be learned here, lessons for the\nU.S. and even lessons for Europe. Mexico’s achievements have come through both monetary and\nfiscal reforms. They have worked in concert to provide the blueprint for a stable, strong\n6\n\n\fmacroeconomy. For this, Mexicans should be proud. And other nations, including my own,\nshould be inspired.\n\nNotes\n1\nWhile there has been no budget resolution for three years, agencies have been funded through\nappropriations committees.\n2\nThe U.S. debt figures cited here refer to “gross federal debt,” which includes virtually all debt\nissued by the U.S. government. It includes intragovernmental debt, such as debt the General\nTreasury owes to the Social Security Trust Fund, as well as publicly held debt. This measure is\nroughly comparable to the Mexican measure of gross federal government debt.\n3\nSee “The Conquest of Mexican Inflation,” by Mark Wynne and Edward C.

Fisher\nThank you, Lee [Graham] for that kind introduction.\nThis morning I would like to provide an overview of the Texas economy as we see it from the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and then draw some inferences for the nation as a whole.\nTexas Redux\nIn a nutshell, Texas continues on a path it has been on for over two decades, outperforming the\nnation in economic growth and job expansion. We have fully recovered the jobs lost during the\nGreat Recession and have punched through previous peak employment levels.\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of when recessions begin and end, dates\nthe onset of the Great Recession as December 2007. The economic performance of Texas since\nDecember 2007 can be summarized with the chart being projected on the screen. It depicts\nemployment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts. In the Eleventh Federal Reserve\nDistrict―or the Dallas Fed’s district—96 percent of the economic production comes from the\n25.7 million people of Texas. As you can see by the red line, we now have more people at work\nthan we had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession. All told, in 2011, Texas created\n212,000 jobs.1\n\nEmployment by Federal Reserve District\nSince the Beginning of the Recession\nJob Growth Index, 100 = December 2007\n\nDallas\n\n101\n\n99\n\nMinneapolis\nNew York\nBoston\nPhiladelphia\nKansas City\nRichmond\nU.S.\nCleveland\nSt. Louis\nChicago\n\n97\n\n95\n\nSan Francisco\n\n93\n\nAtlanta\n\n91\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n1\n\n\fOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and\nNorth Dakota. I do not wish to denigrate the good people of Alaska and North Dakota, but note\nthat their combined population roughly equals that of Travis County.\nReaders of this speech abroad―say, in Washington―might think our growth last year came only\nfrom the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as burgeoning: 30,000\njobs were added in the oil and gas and related support sector last year. And it is correct that with\n25 percent of U.S. refinery capacity and 60 percent of the nation’s petrochemical production\nlocated in Texas, we benefit from both upstream and downstream energy production. But other\nsectors outperformed oil and gas in the number of jobs created in Texas in 2011: 58,000 jobs\nwere added in the professional and business services areas, nearly 46,000 in education and health\nservices, and over 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. Manufacturing―which accounts for\napproximately 8 percent of total Texas employment―added over 27,000 jobs. All told, the\nprivate sector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs in 2011, while the public sector contracted by\n54,800 jobs, due primarily to layoffs of schoolteachers. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2 percent,\nsignificantly above the national rate of 1.3 percent.\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this second graph of\nnonagricultural employment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the\nEleventh District has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the\nslope of the top line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with all the rest\nand, importantly, relative to the employment growth rate for the U.S. as a whole,―denoted by\nthe black line, the seventh one down.\n\nTotal Nonagricultural Employment by\nFederal Reserve District Since 1990\n150\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n\nDallas\n\n140\n\nKansas City\nMinneapolis\nAtlanta\nSan Francisco\nRichmond\nU.S.\nSt. Louis\n\n130\n\n120\n\nPhiladelphia\nChicago\nCleveland\nBoston\nNew York\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nAs was pointed out in high relief when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the hunt for his\nparty’s nomination for the presidency, we do have some serious deficiencies in the Lone Star\nState: We have a very large number of people earning minimum wage; we have an\n2\n\n\funemployment rate that, while trending downward, is still too high―largely stemming from the\nfact that our population of workers, including those who are migrating from other states, is\ngrowing faster than our ability to create jobs―and many other drawbacks. But I’ll bet you that\nthose who harp on our deficiencies and are given to habitual Texas-bashing would give their\nright―or should I say, left―arms to have Texas’ record of robust long-term job creation, instead\nof the anemic employment growth of other mega-states, such as California and New York. Or\neven compared to other countries! This is a fun chart that will titillate the real Texas chauvinists\nin the room. It shows that over the past two decades the rate of employment growth in Texas has\nexceeded that of the euro zone and its two anchors Germany and France, as well as the growth\nrate of two natural-resource-intensive countries with populations comparable to Texas, Canada\nand Australia.\n\nJob Growth Around the Globe\nTexas\n150\n\nJob Growth Index, 100 = January 1990\n(except Euro Area, where 100 = July 1990)\n\nAustralia\n\n140\n\nCanada\n130\n\nU.S.\nEuro Area\n\n120\n\nFrance\nGermany\nU.K.\n\n110\n\nJapan\n\n100\n\n90\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\nAustralia\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .\n\nLooking Forward\nLooking forward, there is good reason to expect continued robust job growth in Texas. The\nbudgetary constraints originally assumed for the state government have proven less severe than\noriginally thought. Due to stronger-than-anticipated tax receipts, it is unlikely employment for\nschools and other state and local institutions will be cut back as sharply as it was last year. And\nthe Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys for January indicate that the prospect for job\nexpansion looks promising.2\nTo track the state’s manufacturing industry―which accounts for about 10 percent of the nation’s\nmanufacturing output―the Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey\n(TMOS). International Strategy & Investment (ISI), a prominent source that tracks, among other\nthings, the various indexes put out by the Federal Reserve, reports that since 2004, the Dallas\nFed’s TMOS business activity index has the highest correlation of all Federal Reserve bank\nsurveys with the Institute of Supply Management’s “PMI”―a leading national index of\n\n3\n\n\fmanufacturing activity and sentiment.3 According to the latest Dallas Fed survey, expectations\nregarding future business conditions are at an almost 12-month high.\nWhile we have good reason to be proud of our manufacturing prowess, the main driver of the\nTexas economy is the service sector. It accounts for over 65 percent of private-sector output and\nemploys more than 7 million Texans. To understand trends in the service sector, the Dallas Fed\nconducts the Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey. According to the most recent survey, the\nemployment index in this survey also signaled an increase in employment levels and in hours\nworked.\nI should add that we are always looking for ways to improve the accuracy of these surveys. As\nsuch, if any of you would be interested in participating in our Texas Manufacturing Outlook\nSurvey, please contact me or my staff.\nIn summary, barring some unforeseeable shock, I would expect Texas to continue leading the\nnation in job creation.\nAn Inconvenient Truth\nOur record of job growth and the fact that people and companies have been voting with their feet\nand relocating to Texas from other states illustrate what for some is an inconvenient truth. The\ncitizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate under the same monetary\npolicy as do the rest of our fellow Americans. We have the same mortgage rates, pay the same\nrates of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and our businesses borrow at the same\ninterest rates as our brethren in the rest of the country. Which raises an important question: If\nmonetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the United States, why does Texas\noutperform the rest?\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that we are blessed with a comparatively great\namount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and other “unfair”\nadvantages.\nFor example, if you examine the differences among New York and California and Texas, you\nwill note that these former power states have less flexible labor rules: We are a right-to-work\nstate; they are not. They have higher population densities: The “Golden State” is 2.3 times as\ndensely populated as Texas; the “Empire State” is four times more densely populated. The cost\nof housing and the cost of living in both states significantly exceed the cost of living here. Scores\nmeasuring the proficiency of middle school students in math are lower in both California and\nNew York than they are in Texas, and in reading, are lower in California and only slightly higher\nin New York.4\nOur senior economist and policy advisor Keith Phillips argues that taken together, these are\namong the important factors affecting where firms choose to locate and hire; these factors also\naffect where people choose to raise their families and seek jobs.\nFiscal and Regulatory Matters Matter\nI would argue that an additional factor favors Texas: We have a Legislature that under both\nDemocratic and Republican governors has over time crafted laws and regulations encouraging\nbusiness expansion and job creation.\n4\n\n\fConsider the example of Hardee’s Restaurants. Hardee’s CEO, Andy Puzder, claims it takes six\nmonths to two years to secure permits in California to build a new Carl’s Jr. eatery, whereas in\nTexas it takes six weeks. This is testimony to the fact that the Texas Legislature and local\ncommunities are mindful that, as Keith Phillips says, “Government regulations are like\nprescription drugs: They can improve the quality of life, but in administering them, one must be\nmindful of their dosage, side effects and interactions.” If the dosage of regulation has the effect\nof chasing employers away, it is clearly counterproductive to job creation and economic growth.\nThis is not to say that there is no role for prudent regulation. For example, in 1997, Texas\nlawmakers passed legislation liberalizing home equity lending but limiting homeowner\nborrowing to no more than 80 percent of their home’s equity. This was no doubt a significant\nfactor in our avoiding the boom and bust of the housing sector, as seen in this chart of the\nrelative performance of home prices since 2000, where Texas is again depicted in the smooth red\nline.\n\nRelative Home Prices Since 2000\n260\n\nHouse Price Index, 2000=100\n\n240\n220\n200\n180\n160\n\nCalifornia\n\n140\n\nTexas\nFlorida\nU.S.\n\n120\n\nNevada\n\n100\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nSOURCES: FHFA House Price Index.\n\nAs a result, at present, we have a relatively low percentage of homes that are “underwater,” as\nshown by this bar chart. Our homeowners are, thus, less burdened with their housing\npredicament and better positioned as consumers. Indeed, by not allowing our people to use their\nlegally protected homesteads as ATMs, our laws prevented housing from fueling the consumer\nspending booms and busts seen in the other U.S. states.\n\n5\n\n\fPercent of Mortgages “Underwater”\n70\n\n60\n\nPercent of Mortgages with Balance > Home Value, 2011 Q3\n58\n47\n\n50\n\n44\n40\n\n35\n30\n\n30\n\n22\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\nNevada\n\nArizona\n\nFlorida\n\nMichigan\n\nCalifornia\n\nTexas\n\nU.S.\n\nSOURCE: Core Logic\n\nI think it is fair to say that the Texas Legislature has conducted the state’s fiscal and regulatory\naffairs so as to maintain confidence in the future.\nLessons Imparted\nOne might draw two lessons here.\nThe first is that Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, is right when he says, “If you\nwant more private demand, you have to take people’s angst away” by having responsible and\ndisciplined fiscal and regulatory policy. Clearly there is less angst involved in conducting\nbusiness in Texas.5\nThe second is a broader, macroeconomic truism: That fiscal and regulatory policy either\ncomplements monetary policy or retards its effectiveness as a propellant for job creation.\nI have noted that under the same monetary policy regime that equally affects all 50 states, Texas\nhas managed to return more quickly to peak employment. I attribute this to several factors but\nunderscore that prudent fiscal and regulatory policy has facilitated our recovery from the Great\nRecession and for at least two decades, under both Democratic and Republican governorships\nand legislatures, has helped make Texas a leader in job creation and economic growth.\nMonetary Accommodation Is Necessary But Insufficient\nMonetary policy provides the fuel for the economic engine that is the United States: As the\nnation’s monetary authority, the Federal Reserve has made money abundant and cheap for\nTexans and all Americans. And yet, businesses will not use that abundant and cheap fuel to an\noptimal degree until they have a clear understanding of how taxes and regulatory and other cost\nfactors will affect their operations going forward. In Texas, they have greater certainty than\nelsewhere that state and local laws and regulations will encourage investment, business\n6\n\n\fformation and job creation, and this gives us an advantage over many other states. But it is only a\nmarginal advantage, which while important, is insufficient for us to reach our full potential in\ncreating jobs. Federal taxes, spending patterns and regulation weigh heavily on the confidence\nand capacity of businesses in Texas, as they do elsewhere in the U.S. Ultimately, the key to\nharnessing the monetary accommodation that has been provided by the Fed lies in the hands of\nour fiscal and regulatory authorities, the Congress working with the executive branch.\nNo business operating in Texas or anywhere else in America can properly budget future costs or\nplan for payroll expansion and capital investment until it knows what its federal taxes will be or\nhow federal spending and regulatory patterns will affect it, its suppliers or its customers. And no\none―business operator, worker or consumer―can plan for the long term with confidence until\nthe federal government removes the angst that is associated with runaway deficits and unfunded\nliabilities that threaten to drown our economy in debt.\nIn a world driven by rapid technological change and globalization, job-creating capital will flow\nnot only to countries that conduct sound monetary policy but to places with the most welcoming,\ncompetitive tax and regulatory systems. This was underscored in a recent Harvard Business\nSchool (HBS) survey authored by Jan Rivkin and Michael Porter, two widely admired scholars\non national competitiveness and economic development. Their survey of HBS alumni found that\nthe greatest impediments to investing in and creating jobs in the U.S. are the current tax code and\nregulatory burden and uncertainty, as well as lagging workforce skills. Absent changes on these\nfronts, the Rivkin/Porter study found that more than 70 percent of respondents expect U.S.\ncompetitiveness to decline over the next three years, and along with it, job-creating investment.6\nNo amount of monetary accommodation will change the pathology described by professors\nRivkin and Porter. Indeed, excessive monetary accommodation might only add a further dosage\nof angst, fueling fears of future inflation. Two weeks ago, following the meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), we formally announced that the Federal Reserve has\ncommitted to targeting a maximum rate of 2 percent inflation over time. We also announced that\nwe could not be bound by a formal numeric target for employment because “non-monetary”\nfactors determine employment levels, in addition to monetary policy. For me, the message was\nclear: If we are to heal the plight of the American worker, our fiscal authorities cannot count on\nthe Federal Reserve to do the job only those authorities can do; they must get their act together,\nset aside their partisan and personal ambitions and act to right their listing fiscal and regulatory\nship.\nMy staff has found a wonderful sketch on YouTube that mimics the action the fiscal authorities\nhave taken thus far. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\nThat sketch says it all. Whereas before, we used to pass the American dream to our children, we\nnow pass the buck.\nMiles To Go Before We Sleep\nNow, it is true that businesses that have driven their cost structure to maximum efficiency are\nbeginning again to hire workers with the help of cheap and widely available money made\npossible by the Fed; the national unemployment rate is beginning to ebb. But too many\nAmericans remain out of work and for too long. We have miles to go before we sleep in the\ncomfort of knowing that the American dream of ever-growing prosperity has been restored.\n7\n\n\fI would submit that until the fiscal authorities―the Congress and the executive—stop their\nposturing and their bickering, job creators will sleep only fitfully until they know how decisions\nabout fiscal policy and regulation―if and when they are made―will affect their operations and\nfinal demand for their products. And until a credible long-term plan is crafted to bring perpetual\ndeficits and debt accumulation under control, they will be haunted by the nightmare that our\nelected leaders are simply passing the bill to our children and our children’s children. This is a\npredicament the Fed is powerless to change.\nOn that happy note, Mr. Graham, I end. Now, in the best tradition of central bankers, I will do\nmy best to avoid answering any questions you might have.\nNotes\n1\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the nation went into recession in December 2007 and\ncame out in June 2009.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAustin, Texas\nFebruary 2, 2012\n\n1\n\n\fA Report on the Texas Economy and a Hawk(s)eye View on Recent\nFed Pronouncements: What Does It All Mean?\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Patti [Ohlendorf]. I am flattered that such a great group of Austinites has turned out\ntonight. I am especially pleased that Alejandro and Rosa Laura Junco are here.\nAlejandro is CEO of the print media company Grupo Reforma. He has earned a sterling\nreputation for journalistic independence in a part of the world where independence is a rare and\nsometimes dangerous thing. Columbia University, the University of Missouri and Michigan State\nUniversity have honored him for his journalistic accomplishments, and the University of Texas\nat Austin has named him a Distinguished Alumnus.\nAlejandro’s company and its flagship paper in Mexico City take their name from La Reforma, a\nperiod of liberalizing reforms that transformed Mexico into a nation state in the mid-19th\ncentury, beginning with the overthrow of the man Texans know best and like least―Santa\nAnna―and ending with the ascension to power of a good general gone bad, Porfirio Diaz. As a\nchild growing up in Mexico City, I was taught about La Reforma in school. To this day, I can\nprobably tell you as much about Benito Juarez, journalist-turned-jurist-turned-president Jose\nMaria Iglesias and other Reformistas as I can about Houston or Lamar or Washington or\nLincoln.1 Alejandro and Rosa Laura, seeing you tonight has revived school-day memories of\nsome 53 years ago! It is a delight and honor to be with you.\nI will do two things tonight. First, I will give you an update on the performance of the Texas\neconomy and what lies ahead. Second, I will give you my personal view of what the Federal\nReserve’s Open Market Committee―the FOMC―announced after our meeting last week. Then,\ntime permitting, I will be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\nAn Update on the Texas Economy\nThe economic performance of Texas since December 2007―the beginning of the U.S. recession,\naccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research―can be summarized with the chart\nbeing projected on the screen denoting employment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso\nadminister the business of the Eleventh District (depicted by the red line), which includes Texas,\nnorthern Louisiana and southern New Mexico; 96 percent of the economic production of my\ndistrict comes from the 25.7 million people of Texas. In 2011, Texas created 211,600 jobs. We\nnow have more people at work than we had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession in\nthe United States. We have now surpassed our previous peak employment levels.\n\n2\n\n\fOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and\nNorth Dakota. I do not wish to denigrate the good people of Alaska and North Dakota, but note\nthat their combined population roughly equals that of Travis County.\nReaders of this speech abroad―say, in New York―might think our growth last year came only\nfrom the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as burgeoning: 30,000\njobs were added in the oil and gas and related support sector last year, an increase of 15 percent.\nBut other sectors outperformed oil and gas in the number of jobs created in Texas in 2011:\n58,000 jobs were added in the professional and business services areas, nearly 46,000 in\neducation and health services and over 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. All told, the private\nsector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs, while the public sector, driven primarily by fewer\nschoolteachers, contracted by 54,800 jobs. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2 percent, significantly\nabove the national rate of 1.3 percent.\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this second graph of\nemployment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the Eleventh\nDistrict has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the slope of the\ntop line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with all the rest and,\nimportantly, relative to the black line―the seventh one down―the employment growth rate for\nthe country as a whole.\n\n3\n\n\fHere is the point: Judging solely by the employment data, Texas went into recession seven\nmonths after the nation, in September 2008, and came out three months earlier, in December\n2009.2 We have now recovered fully from the Great Recession and are back on pace in leading\nthe nation in job growth. Yes, we have a very large number of people earning minimum wage, a\nstill-too-high unemployment rate of 7.8 percent and many other deficiencies, all of which were\npointed out in high relief when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the hunt for his party’s\nnomination for the presidency. But I’ll bet you, those who love to point these things out and are\ngiven generally to Texas-bashing would give their right―or should I say, left―arms to have the\nrecord of job growth of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District that is documented by these charts.\nSo good citizens of Austin and of Texas, you have much to be proud of.\nAs to projections, there is no reason to not expect continued job growth at the same pace in\nTexas. The budgetary constraints originally assumed for the state government have proven less\nsevere than originally thought: Due to stronger-than-anticipated tax receipts, cutbacks in\nemployment for schools and other state and local institutions may end up being less drastic. And\nif the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys for January, released this past Monday and\nTuesday, are reviewed, job expansion looks promising and expectations regarding future\nbusiness conditions are at the highest level in almost 12 months. Our most recent employment\nindexes in those surveys signaled an increase in both employment levels and in hours worked.3\nThus, barring some unforeseeable shock, I would expect Texas to continue leading the nation in\njob creation.\nAn Inconvenient Truth\nIncidentally, our record of job growth and the fact that people and companies have been voting\nwith their feet and relocating to Texas from other states illustrate what for some is an\n4\n\n\finconvenient truth. The citizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate\nunder the same monetary policy as do the rest of our fellow Americans. We have the same\nmortgage rates, pay the same rate of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and earn\nreturns and borrow at the same interest rates as do our brethren in the rest of the country. Which\nraises an important question: If monetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the\nUnited States, why does Texas outperform the rest?\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that we are blessed with a comparatively great\namount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and other “unfair”\nadvantages. But one cannot avoid the conclusion that one of those “unfair” advantages is that we\nhave a Legislature, based here in Austin, that under both Democrat and Republican governors\nhas over time crafted laws and regulations that encourage business expansion and job creation.\nThey have conducted the fiscal affairs of the state so as to maintain confidence in the future. One\nmight draw two lessons here: first, that Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, is right\nwhen he says, “If you want more private demand, you have to take people’s angst away” by\nhaving responsible and disciplined fiscal policy;4 and second, that fiscal policy either\ncomplements monetary policy or retards its effectiveness as a propellant for job creation.\nHerein lies the tale of the recent long-term policy and strategy statement issued by the FOMC at\nthe conclusion of its meetings last week.\nThe Recent Pronouncements of the FOMC\nMany of you may have read that the FOMC did three things after its two-day meeting Tuesday\nand Wednesday a week ago.\nFirst, the committee issued the usual policy statement, stating that it “currently anticipates that\neconomic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at\nleast through late 2014.”5\nThere are presently 17 participants in FOMC meetings: the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents\nand the five current governors. Ten out of the 17 people get to vote in any given year, with the\ngovernors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York always having a vote. I voted last year,\nand you may recall that together with Mr. [Charles] Plosser of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia and Mr. [Narayana] Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed, I resisted the notion of a\nneed for a statement indicating that monetary accommodation be tied to a specific date, be it in\nmid-2013, late 2014 or any other. Instead, I feel that the key should be to calibrate monetary\npolicy according to the state or condition of the economy.\nWhile most all of my colleagues value the state-contingent argument, at last week’s meeting the\nmajority of this year’s voters felt that a combination of factors—including an expectation that\n“economic growth over coming quarters [will] be modest and … the unemployment rate will\ndecline only gradually”; that the housing sector “remains depressed”; and that a “slowing in\nglobal growth” and other factors, combined with an anticipation “that over coming quarters,\ninflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate”—\nwarranted a need for the committee to indicate it would likely maintain a significantly\naccommodative monetary stance for another three years.\n\n5\n\n\fSecond, the statement was accompanied by a first-ever release of the individual economic and\ninterest-rate forecasts of all the policy meeting’s 17 participants. Mind you, these are not binding\ncommitments. They are based on the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy” and are,\ndespite the best of intentions, largely guesswork, especially looking out over a multiyear period.\nMy predecessor at the helm of the Dallas Fed, Bob McTeer, used to say, “The first rule of\nforecasting should be ‘don’t do it.’” The second rule, he would add is, “If you give a number,\ndon’t give a date.” But given the assignment to venture a vision as to where the fed funds rate\nwould be in each of the next three years and over “the longer run” to the nearest one-quarter of\none percent, the 17 intrepid souls of the FOMC, including yours truly, did so. Only three\nenvisioned that the fed funds rate might rise from current levels by year-end 2012; six saw it\ndoing so by year-end 2013; and 11 by year-end 2014. Over the longer term, the 17 members\nenvisioned a funds rate of between 3¾ and 4½ percent.\nBob McTeer’s admonishment clearly does not resonate with the FOMC. And yet I would\ncaution, again, that at best, the economic forecasts and interest-rate projections of the FOMC are\nultimately pure guesses. I have yet to find a single economist on this planet who consistently\nforecasts the economy accurately, let alone projects with any precision the interest rate on\novernight funds one year out or far into the future. If you examine the record of the Blue Chip\neconomists or even of our superb Federal Reserve staff, you will find confirmation of a paucity\nof reliable economic forecasts.\nI note that even publicly traded companies that wrestle with the relatively easy task of providing\nforward guidance on revenue and earnings find that exercise especially vexing; most won’t\nventure beyond forecasting the upcoming quarter―and that is after they already have a month’s\nworth of the quarter’s data in hand! In this morning's Financial Times, Charles Goodhart,\nprofessor emeritus at the London School of Economics and former member of the Bank of\nEngland’s Monetary Policy Committee, claims to have examined the record of three central\nbanks that have most prominently engaged in the practice of providing multiyear rate forecasts.\nHe concludes: “The record for central banks in New Zealand, Sweden and Norway is not\nencouraging. In the short run, over the next three months and to a lesser extent over the\nsubsequent quarter, these central banks do have additional (inside) information about their own\nfuture actions. Beyond this, however, the extra informational content of those central bank\nforecasts is zero. Moreover, the market knows that central bankers have no superhuman\nforecasting ability and will tend to view the supposed longer-term forecasts as a version of\njawboning, attempts to persuade the market to change its mind for immediate policy purposes.\nAgain, there is little empirical evidence that the market responds to such jawboning, and why\nshould it when the central bank is as ignorant of the longer-term future as they are?”6\nI don’t in any way consider my learned colleagues on the FOMC to be ignorant. But I draw upon\nmy own experience in the corporate world and upon the insights offered by Goodhart to suggest\nthat you simply take all this forward guidance and forecasting a year or more out with a big grain\nof salt, bearing in mind that the policy statements and forecasts issued by the FOMC are tactical\njudgments of the moment, made within a broader strategic context.\nThe Most Important Announcement\nWhich leads me to what I consider the third and most important announcement we made last\nweek: the statement of our longer-range goals and strategy. For the first time, the entire 176\n\n\fmember committee stated that, given inflation over the longer term is primarily determined by\nmonetary policy, we are able to specify that an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with our mandate. At the same\ntime, we stated that we cannot specify an exact goal for employment because “the maximum\nlevel of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market” and that “change over time and may not be directly measurable.”7\nIn the aviary of monetary policy makers, I am considered a “hawk.” I respect the fact that the\nCongress of the United States has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate of conducting\nmonetary policy so as to have full employment and simultaneously maintain stable prices. I\nbelieve monetary policy is the principal determinant of long-term price stability. But I have long\nmaintained that monetary policy is but one gear in the complicated gearbox that drives job\ncreation. Education and other structural aspects of our economy condition the nation’s jobcreating capacity; fiscal and regulatory policy, in turn, condition both the structure and dynamics\nof employment. I was delighted that the full committee recognized this and made it part of its\nofficial credo.\nIn a world driven by rapid technological change and globalization, job-creating capital will flow\nnot only to countries that conduct sound monetary policy but to places with the most welcoming,\ncompetitive tax and regulatory systems. This was underscored in a recent Harvard Business\nSchool (HBS) survey authored by Jan Rivkin and Michael Porter, two widely admired scholars\non national competitiveness and economic development. Their survey of HBS alumni found that\nthe greatest impediments to investing in and creating jobs in the U.S. are our current tax code\nand regulatory burden and uncertainty, as well as lagging workforce skills. Absent changes on\nthese fronts, the Rivkin/Porter study found that more than 70 percent of respondents expect U.S.\ncompetitiveness to decline over the next three years, and along with it, job-creating investment.8\nThus for me, explicitly acknowledging that monetary policy’s impact on employment is\ntransitory and uncertain is a cardinal event. It signals to the markets that there are limits to the\nultimate job-stoking efficacy of Federal Reserve policy. To the extent that inflation is running\nbelow 2 percent, the Federal Reserve may have somewhat greater latitude to pursue\naccommodation. However, the past few years have demonstrated, yet again, that allowing\ninflation to rise by no means guarantees faster job growth. The message to our nation’s fiscal\nauthorities is that they cannot expect monetary policy to substitute for the need to get their act\ntogether, stop their shameful politicking, get on with putting their fiscal and regulatory house in\norder and do so in a manner that encourages rather than continually undermines job creation and\neconomic expansion.\nFiscal Matters Matter\nI noted how Texas has managed under the same monetary policy regime to more quickly return\nto peak employment than other states. I attributed this in significant part to prudent fiscal and\nregulatory policy, underscoring that this not only facilitates job and overall economic expansion\nin Texas, but is the underpinning of confidence. I would suggest that now is the time for prudent\nfiscal policy to be enacted by a Congress that on both sides of the aisle has for far too long, under\nboth Republican and Democratic presidents, been shamefully negligent of its responsibility.\nToday marks the 1,009th day without an agreed-upon federal government budget. The Congress\nhas found it easier to not agree on a budget than to go about correcting fiscal imbalances that\n7\n\n\fdrive the nation’s growing indebtedness. Our political leaders’ misfeasance exacerbates the\n“angst” that inhibits the confidence of consumers and job-creating businesses.\nMy staff has found a wonderful sketch on YouTube that might best illustrate the behavior of\nCongress. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\nThat sketch says it all. The Fed, the nation’s monetary authority, has clearly articulated its\nlonger-run goal and policy strategy and has conducted itself with integrity by responding to the\nneeds of the economy. In contrast, the fiscal authorities have conducted themselves with\nimpunity: Their only long-term strategy is to pass the bill to our children and grandchildren.\nReforma Is Needed\nI would suggest that Reforma is urgently needed in the conduct of fiscal affairs in our nation’s\ncapital.\nAnd I will leave you with this thought: The power to make that happen is in your hands. You and\nyour fellow citizens across this great country are the ones who elect the people who tax you and\ndecide where to spend your money; you ultimately direct the nation’s fiscal future.\nAnd you share in the blame for it being such a mess.\nAccepting the status quo means you are acquiescing to encumbering your children and your\nchildren’s children with mismanaged fiscal policy, crippling debt and a dismal economic future.\nLook to Alejandro Junco as an example. He has taken great risk with his person and his family’s\ntreasure to take on the status quo. Like Alejandro did for journalism in Mexico, I hope you will\nstep up to the plate, risk whatever personal benefits and comforts you derive from the current\nregime and use your talents and resources to force a course correction in the fiscal affairs of our\nnation. For only then can we be assured of a bright and prosperous economic future. And only\nthen can monetary policy, properly conducted, perform with maximum efficiency and minimal\nrisk to price stability to restore the great job-creation potential of America.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1\n\nFor non-Texans, Sam Houston was the first and third president of the Republic of Texas (1836–38 and 1841–44);\nMirabeau B. Lamar was the second president of the Republic of Texas (1838–41).\n2\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the nation went into recession in December 2007 and\ncame out in June 2009.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAustin, Texas\nDecember 8, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fDigits and Widgets\n(With Reference to a Wise Mother, the Golden Book Encyclopedia,\nWinston Churchill and Hunter Lawrence)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Barry [Mayer].\nThere are many distinguished Texans in this room. I would like to single out one of them: my\ndaughter, Alison. I am very proud of her. She inherited her mother’s brains and graduated with\nhonors in English literature from Harvard, where she was president of the Seneca, one of the\nlargest women’s service organizations on the Harvard campus. Alison is now a graduate student\nat UT–Austin, in her second year at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. She is not only smart and\nstrong and beautiful, but she is tolerant—so much so, she is even willing to sit through one of her\nfather’s speeches. I am thrilled she is here.\nEducation is something I hold dear to my heart. It changed my life. Neither of my parents—\nAlison’s paternal grandparents—was formally educated. My father never made it past fourth\ngrade. In lieu of middle school and high school, he swept floors under the lathes at a\nmetalworking factory in Australia. My mother, a stern Norwegian raised in South Africa,\nattended the equivalent of a secretarial high school. They wanted better for me. Among the many\nfond memories I have of my mother, God rest her soul, two came to mind as I prepared this little\nsermon for today. The first was our twice-monthly trek when I was 12 to a local store to get the\nlatest installment of the Golden Book Encyclopedia—these were the only books we could readily\nafford in our household at the time. Golden Books issued one volume per letter of the alphabet,\nand she insisted I read it cover to cover in order to ―earn‖ the next volume. The second was her\nadmonition that I had ―better do well in school and learn to love to learn‖ because, in her stern\nwords, ―you can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.‖\nIn his introduction, Barry listed all those great schools I was lucky to attend and all the fancy\njobs I’ve had—shorthand in our resume-driven society for ―he’s done all right.‖ All that can be\ntraced back to a determined mother and the Golden Book Encyclopedia, as well as some\ninspirational teachers in primary and secondary school and a pragmatic father. When I got my\nM.B.A. from Stanford, my dad pulled me aside and said: ―Enough already. In one generation,\nwe’ve gone from no education to too much! Now get a job and go to work!‖\nI have a job to do today, so I better go to work speaking on the topic you asked me here for: the\nsubject of education.\nThe benefits we derive from the books and the buildings and the teachers and tutors that form the\nbuilding blocks of our educational society don’t stop at the classroom door. They spread\noutward, affecting our lives and the lives of others around us in innumerable ways. Today I am\ngoing to speak from the perspective of the economy and living standards, a principal\npreoccupation of the Federal Reserve.\n\n1\n\n\fThere are countless studies in the economics literature that highlight the links between increases\nin educational levels and economic productivity and improvements in society’s welfare.\nEmployment is significantly higher among the more educated. Workers with a college degree\nexperience lower fluctuations in employment and, if they do lose their jobs in tough times such\nas these, do so at a lower rate than their less-educated peers and are more likely to find new jobs.\nThe simple fact is you earn what you learn. Education pays off. We can see this in the wage data\nprovided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, the average hourly wage in Texas was\n$18.90. In the same period, the average hourly wage in Texas for internal medicine doctors was\n$77.22, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer engineers and $29.70 for nurses.\nThe more you learn, the more you earn.\nIn 1980, a college degree would earn you about 50 percent more than a high school diploma. In\n1990, that differential jumped to 73 percent and, in 2000, to 85 percent. Today, someone who\nholds a college degree earns 97 percent more than his or her classmate who went no further than\nhigh school.\nYou earn what you learn. Higher education is the key to improved earnings and social prosperity.\nThis is no great mystery. We make our living as Americans less with our muscles than we do\nwith our brains. At the beginning of the 20th century, when my parents were born, 37 percent of\nthe U.S. workforce was employed in agriculture. Today, in Alison’s world, agricultural output\nrepresents less than 2 percent of our gross domestic product and employs just over 1 percent of\nour workers. In 1900, 38 percent of our labor force worked in ―industry,‖ a broad category that\nincludes manufacturing, construction and mining. Today, manufacturing employs 10 percent of\nour workforce, and mining—less than 1 percent.\nThe delivery of services has replaced ag and manufacturing and mining and oil and gas and is the\nengine of our growth. At the beginning of the 20th century, 26 percent of our workforce was\nemployed in services. Today that number is about 80 percent. We are a service-driven economy.\nWinston Churchill used to refer in his speeches to the ―superfine processes‖ that added value to\nbasic raw material inputs in the era when Britannia ruled the waves of the Manufacturing Age\neconomy. Today, we live at an ever-higher end of the value-added spectrum, with education\nbeing the stuff of our economic success.\nWe have the most efficient services workers in the world. Contrary to popular belief, we sell\nthose services not just at home, but around the globe. Sales of things like computer and\ninformation services, research and development, accounting and auditing, and management and\nconsulting earn us substantial foreign income—so much so that while we run a deficit in our\ntrade in goods with the rest of the world, we run a surplus in our trade in services. It trims our\noverall trade deficit some 20 percent from what it would otherwise be.\nEven lawyers make money abroad. Imagine that! Our exports of legal services in 2008 were four\ntimes our imports. In the same year, exports in advertising, finance, medical services and\neducation exceeded our imports in these categories by a factor of three. And thanks to Brad Pitt\nand Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie and Jessica Simpson—and, indeed, despite Sunday night’s\nignominious defeat, Jessica’s ex, Tony Romo—our foreign distribution of films, TV shows,\n2\n\n\fperforming arts and sports programming and products are in such tremendous demand abroad\nthat their overseas sales exceed our imports by a factor of seven.\nThe point is this: The fields and factories that powered the economy of yesterday remain\nimportant in the United States and in Texas. But more important in the current economy and to\nour economic future is the production of high-value-added services. As some have previously\nnoted, in the world of ―superfine processes‖ of the Knowledge Age, digits are the new widgets.\nThe brain is to the Knowledge Age and the mastery of digits what the engine was to the\nManufacturing Age and the management of widgets. Education is the steam and the oil and the\ngas that propel that engine. The speed at which we move our economy forward from this point\nonward will depend on how well we educate our children. We cannot produce the skilled labor\nneeded to advance this economy without a top-notch educational system—one that relentlessly\npushes America farther up the value-added ladder while the Chinese and the Indians and others\nscurry up the lower rungs of that ladder with their billions of eager workers and ever-more agile\ngrasp of the most basic tools of technology.\nAs I understand this conference, you all are here to ―grade [your] own paper‖—to assess your\nefforts to create a top-notch educational system here in this great city and state.\nGene [Austin], you wrote a comprehensive piece on this subject just last month in the Austin\nAmerican-Statesman. I agree that many efforts undertaken at the state and local levels—like the\n―20,010 by 2010‖ initiative—are producing real results. But we cannot declare victory yet. We\nhave many, many miles to go before we sleep.\nPersonally, I will not sleep until we get our higher education house in order. For a state as great\nas Texas, we are woefully lacking in tier-one universities.\nI want you to consider the following. It is fashionable in economic and financial circles to talk\nabout the ―BRIC‖ nations: Brazil and Russia, India and China. Yet, in the second quarter of this\nyear, Texas produced more than two of those four countries did: more than Russia and more than\nIndia. And we were not all that far behind Brazil. You heard me correctly. The 24 million people\nof the Lone Star State, in the second quarter of this year, produced more in dollar-denominated\neconomic output than the 1.1 billion people of India or the 140 million of Russia, at then-current\nexchange rates, and about 81 percent of what Brazil produced with half of South America’s\npopulation and just under half of South America’s land mass.\nTexas is a global economic power, surpassed in the United States only by California. So far, so\ngood. But as you look into the future of the Knowledge Age and contemplate the ambition of the\nBRIC countries and others that will compete with us for a piece of the global economic pie, the\npicture darkens.\nConsider this: Texas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System,\nwhose home is right here in Austin, is the granddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000\nstudents in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has 11\nuniversities with 100,000-plus students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining\nstudents are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of\nNorth Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F.\n3\n\n\fAustin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are each independent public\nuniversities. Together, these institutions house over 530,000 students.\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The\ngranddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities.\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the\nUniversity of California System? Not one of you. That is because you know that in addition to\nBerkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Irvine, UC–\nDavis and UC–Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, Caltech and\nthe Claremont Colleges.\nNow here is a fact we must face up to. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey,\nBerkeley, UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Davis, UC–Santa Barbara and UC–Irvine all outranked\nour beloved UT–Austin—which placed 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of\nour universities? The Aggies in College Station ranked 61st. The Mustangs of SMU ranked 68th,\nthe Baylor Bears 80th and the Horned Frogs of TCU, 110th. The shining stars of our higher\neducation galaxy are the appropriately named Owls of Rice, ranked 17th behind Johns Hopkins,\ntied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\nIt galls me that the ―overtaxed, overregulated, left coast state‖ of California has within one fleet\nsix universities that are ranked better than UT–Austin, our flagship. It bothers me to no end that\nwe have only one university in our state that ranks in the top 20 in the nation.\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American\nUniversities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the\ncrop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These\n60 U.S. schools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities;\nthey are home to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the\nNational Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each\nof those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with\nAAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas\nuniversities included in this prestigious group of 60.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook\nUniversity, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add\nan eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\nThink about it. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about, a state that has\na glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as Boston.\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex—my hometown—has … none. Think about that: The fourthlargest metropolitan district in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution.\nWe do have UT–Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school\n4\n\n\fstanding alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced\ntechnology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future in a fiercely competitive\nglobalized world without a single elite university in Dallas? Or with only one in the great city of\nHouston? With a university ranked 47th in Austin? And with none of the top 50 in any other city\nin Texas? How can we expect Texas to continue to outproduce India and Russia and other\nhungry competitors and excel in the Knowledge Age—an era in which prosperity and wealth will\nbe defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven\nfinancial expertise—with so few established fountainheads of advanced knowledge? How can\nwe reasonably expect to prepare the youth of today—a group that I know you all care about, or\nelse you would not have sacrificed your time to be here—if we aren’t providing them with topnotch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Austin’s cityscape. When you\ntravel to Dallas or Houston or any of our other great cities, look at their skylines. How many\nfactories will you see? You won’t see any—at least none of the old-fashioned kind with\nsmokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel\nbuildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains.\nBrains that are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I described earlier.\nWe need more of that brainpower, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands\nof the world’s best and brightest here in Texas, here in Austin, and in Houston and Dallas and\nFort Worth and every nook and cranny of South and East and West Texas. We can fuel our\neconomy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other\ncountries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots\nin our community and its commitment to building our state and all the benefits it would bring to\nour arts and civic and educational communities, on top of the economic muscle it would add.\nLike everybody in this room, I swelled with pride when I watched Hunter Lawrence put that\nfootball through the uprights in the last second of Saturday night’s game at the ―House that Jerry\nBuilt.‖ I delight in seeing TCU ranked among the nation’s top teams. As a former high school\nquarterback, I love dropping in on high school games on Friday nights. And whenever I lecture\nthese days at our universities across the state, I can’t help but notice how handsome or beautiful\nthe young men and women are in our classrooms.\nBut then I think back to my mother’s admonition: ―You can’t expect to get by in America just\nrelying on your looks or your athletic ability.‖ We can’t expect Texas to get by, let alone\ndominate, in a globalized economy where digits are the new widgets simply by relying on our\ngood looks and athletic prowess.\nHere is the punch line: If you are willing to leave this room today accepting the fact that we have\nonly two universities ranked in the top 50 in the nation and only one, Rice, in the top 20, then\nyou are not the Texans I know and love. If you are willing to accept that the Longhorns of UT–\nAustin, mighty as they are, are outflanked on the educational battlefield by six campuses of the\nUC System, then I have severely overestimated your commitment to this great state of ours. If\nany of you are willing to accept that Guy Bailey at Texas Tech or David Daniel at the University\nof Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at SMU or Victor Boschini at TCU or Ricardo Romo at UT–\n5\n\n\fSan Antonio or Diana Natalicio at UTEP or Renu Khator at the University of Houston or Bowen\nLoftin at Texas A&M or William Powers here at UT–Austin is fighting with one hand tied\nbehind his or her back because the powers-that-be here in the capital cannot rise to the cause and\ngive to this state what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San\nDiego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well,\nyou, my friends, are suffering from a serious case of denial.\n―Denying‖ the people of Texas the tier-one universities they deserve presents a serious barrier to\nour future prosperity. We face many challenges head-on in this state. This is the biggest\nchallenge of all. Face up to it, and get on with it. Thank you.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "Remarks Before the 6th Annual YMCA\nKey Leaders Lunch\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nDecember 2, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks Before the 6th Annual YMCA Key Leaders Lunch\nRichard W. Fisher\nI was tempted to title this speech ―A Trip to Egypt,‖ for just as there are myths and suppositions\nabout ancient Egypt, all too often, the business of the Federal Reserve has been viewed as a\nriddle wrapped inside a mystery inside an enigma. This afternoon, I would like to take some of\nmy time with you to unlock that mystery—to take a peek into the inner sanctum. I’ll then end\nwith a word about our economic future in this great region of this great state.\nDespite the general mystique that traditionally surrounds central banking, I would bet that at\nleast some of the folks in this room are familiar with William McChesney Martin—the man who\nserved as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board longer than anyone else in the institution’s\nhistory.\nWhile some of you might recall that Bill Martin was a longtime chairman of the Fed, far fewer of\nyou are likely familiar with his failed bid—and I use the word ―bid‖ very generously—for the\npresidency. Let me explain. Once a year, a group called the Alfalfa Club—one of the great\ninstitutions in Washington, D.C.—holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political\npretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the\npresidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are\nthenceforth known as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who lost his\nbid for the presidency nine times before running and subsequently losing a tenth time on the\nAlfalfa ticket. The group’s motto is ―Veni, Vidi, Defici,‖ a phrase loosely taken from the Latin\nfor ―I came, I saw, I lost.‖\nIn 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president, Bill Martin was nominated to\nrun for the American presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. In his acceptance speech, he\nannounced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he would take his cues from the\nGerman philosopher Goethe, ―who said that people could endure anything except continual\nprosperity.‖ Therefore, Martin continued, he would adopt a platform to ―make life endurable\nagain, by stamping out prosperity.‖\n―I shall conduct the administration of the country,‖ he said, ―exactly as I have so successfully\nconducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that\ncan be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all\ntheir conflicting counsel.‖\nMartin gave his Alfalfa Club speech some 52 years after Congress passed the Federal Reserve\nAct and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law so as to encourage, not stamp out,\neconomic prosperity. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the\ncreation of the 12 regional banks. The Fed could have been set up solely in Washington, like so\nmany other institutions of the central government. Having representatives from all parts of the\ncountry, however, brings a deeper, more diverse perspective (and occasional ―conflicting\ncounsel‖!), unfettered by politics or political imperatives, to the policy debate at the meetings of\n1\n\n\fthe Open Market Committee when we collectively determine monetary policy, giving a clearer\nview of what is really happening in the U.S. economy. The regional banks maintain branch\noffices in cities within their district to stay in touch with local economic conditions and business\nleaders. In the case of the Dallas Fed, we maintain branches in Houston, San Antonio and El\nPaso.\nIf you truly wish to unlock the mysteries of the Fed—to take a peek into the inner sanctum—you\nshould start by learning a little about the businesses we operate in Dallas as a part of the central\nbank of the United States.\nWhen I was a student at Oxford, the great insurance magnate of that time, Clement Stone, came\nto speak at the Oxford Union. A student asked him to kindly share with the audience what he\nconsidered the key to success. He looked out at the audience, curled up his Ronald Coleman\nmustache and said: ―In one word: cash.‖ So let’s start there. One of the duties of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks and their branches and depots is to provide to the banks in their districts what\nClement Stone considered the key to success: cash.\nOur main cash vault in Dallas is the size of a five-story building. That vault holds lots of Federal\nReserve banknotes—what you might know as dollar bills. Through the third quarter of this year,\nwe distributed and received 4.2 billion circulating banknotes, worth nearly $76 billion at face\nvalue. That’s almost $490 million in cash passing through our Pearl Street vaults every day. This\nis a thing of beauty to watch. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate just shy of\n100,000 bills per hour. They cull about 780 counterfeit bills each month. They pluck out almost\n39 million worn bills each month—valued at $538 million—and we then shred them and send\nthem off to Money Heaven. The life span of a typical $1 bill, incidentally, is just 21 months. A\n$20 bill lasts 2 years, and a $100 bill—the largest denomination of currency in circulation since\n1969—lasts nearly seven and a half years.\nWe also process checks. From January through September of 2009, the Dallas Fed processed\n69.2 million checks, worth about $58.4 billion. Over the same period, we’ve handled a daily\naverage of 364,000 paper checks—although that business has been, and will continue to be, on a\nsubstantial decline. Due to advances in technology, many banks now send us checks\nelectronically in a digital format. We received and processed an average of 543,000 electronic\nimages each day through the first three quarters of this year.\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to District depository\ninstitutions through our discount window operations—to be what some have called a banker’s\nbank. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by\nproviding a source of short-term funding, which must be fully secured, to depository institutions\nin times of need. In 2008, we made 273 loans approximating $30 billion. I chair our credit\ncommittee and personally review the loans we make every evening. Some of them are very large\n(a billion or more) and some very small (as little as $10,000), depending on the needs of the\nborrowing bank, for overnight purposes or, during the recent financial crisis, up to 84 days so\nthat they might conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of their customers.\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our respective\ndistrict. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and\nstability measures using electronic surveillance technologies.\n2\n\n\fThis supervisory role is important. I began my private-sector career at the bank of Brown\nBrothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle—one\nI’m sure the bankers in this room know quite well: Know your customer. Well, we at the Fed\nrely upon our regulatory relationship to better ―know our customers,‖ actively monitoring our\nconstituents’ needs and services on the front-line of the commercial banking industry.\nThe Dallas Fed has also launched public education programs designed to raise financial and\neconomic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on\nsignificant activities within our economy.\nWe also do serious economic research, designed to provide the intellectual heft for informed\nmonetary policymaking. Our Research Department employs a crack team of economists and\nanalysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few\nof you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team here in\nDallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\nLike many of our other operations, our research function is spread among our branches. In\naddition to tracking trends across Texas, our economists in San Antonio and Houston and El\nPaso maintain a keen interest in subjects like the U.S.–Mexico border economy and energy\nmarkets.\nThe Dallas Fed has also taken upon itself the job of contemplating how globalization impacts the\nexecution of monetary policy with the formation of the Globalization and Monetary Policy\nInstitute. While still in its nascent stages, this group has produced a hefty volume of original\nwork and collaborated with top minds around the world to devise new theories and models to\nunderstand this oft-overlooked economic link. This Institute is privileged to have on its board the\ncentral bank governors of Japan, Singapore and Mexico; the Deputy Governor of the Bank of\nEngland; the former deputy of the European Central Bank and other notables that help bring an\ninformed global perspective to our work and, I might add, help us showcase Dallas to the world.\nWhile currency processing, banking supervision and research efforts are an important part of the\nFed’s job, they are certainly not the part of central banking that garners the most public attention.\nThe sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered ―sexy‖—\ndeal with monetary policy.\nAs president of one of the 12 regional banks I described earlier, I have the privilege of serving on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee: the Fed’s central policymaking body. Together with the\nfive Board governors (two shy of normal, thanks to a hold-up in the nomination and confirmation\nprocess), we meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the\nappropriate policy response.\nOur statement, released like clockwork at 2:15 Eastern time, outlines the committee’s thoughts\nand subsequent policy actions. Parenthetically, I might note that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee is one of the few decisionmaking bodies in the world where members can come\ntogether and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions vociferously, agree to a\ncourse of action, craft a statement for public release and, most importantly, break in time for\nlunch.\n3\n\n\fIt is also a place where Texas, like the other states, has a voice at the table of making policy for\nthe most powerful and essential central bank in the world. The President of the United States\nappoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The member\nbankers in Texas and the Eleventh District elect a nine-member board of directors—similar to\nthe other 12 regional banks. Those boards hire and fire the bank presidents.\nI was hired by a board led by Ray Hunt. Presently, I serve at the pleasure of a board of directors\nthat includes Herb Kelleher; Mike Ullman, the chairman and CEO of J.C. Penney; Margaret\nJordan, the president and CEO of Dallas Medical Resource; and Bob Estrada, who most people\nin this room know, among others. I mention this to underscore that I and my fellow bank\npresidents represent Main Street and not the Washington political establishment or Wall Street.\nAnd I want you to know that every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the\nFOMC—which is quite often—I do so very much with that in mind.\nSuffice it to say that those who serve alongside me in the hallowed halls of the Federal Reserve\nspend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. You should take comfort in\nthat fact.\nNow, I know, Gordie, that you wanted me to say a few words on the economy. In a word it is\nimproving. But slowly. The national economy is trying to work its way out of our [AD LIB]. If\nyou will indulge me, I’d like to wrap up my remarks with a discussion of an issue that I hold near\nand dear to my heart—one that has a significant effect on this region’s future and economic\nprosperity and is key to our long-term economic success as a city and as a state.\nDallas–Fort Worth is the fourth-most-populous metropolitan area in the country and the sixthmost economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population and productivity,\nsurpassed on both fronts only by California. We produce more economic output in the Lone Star\nState than India does. Or Mexico. We are a global economic power.\nTexas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System is the\ngranddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000 students in nine universities and six health\ninstitutions. The Texas A&M System has eleven universities with 100,000-plus students and a\nmulticampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the\nTexas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston\nSystem and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and\nTexas Woman’s are each independent public universities. Together, these institutions house over\n530,000 students.\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The\ngranddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities.\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the\nUniversity of California System? Not one of you. And that is because you know that in addition\nto Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC\nDavis and UC Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, CalTech and\nthe Claremont Colleges.\n4\n\n\fNow here is a fact. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA,\nUC San Diego, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine all outranked UT Austin—which\nplaced 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M\nwas ranked 61st. SMU ranked 68th, Baylor 80th and TCU—despite the high rankings of its\npowerhouse football club—110th. The shining star in our higher education galaxy is Rice,\nranked 17th, behind Johns Hopkins and tied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\nHold that thought: The ―overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state‖ of California has within one\nfleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our flagship.\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American\nUniversities, which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of\nresearch universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S.\nschools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are\nhome to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Science, the National\nAcademy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those\nfields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU\nuniversities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities\nincluded in this prestigious group of 60.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook\nUniversity, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add\nan eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about; a state of\nover 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none and an economic powerhouse\nthat produces more than India or Mexico—has the same number of AAU member universities as\nthe greater Boston area. And Dallas, our hometown…has none. Think about that: The eighthlargest city in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT\nSouthwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no\nmatter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth\nknowledge across many fields.\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future without a single elite\nuniversity in our city? How can we expect Dallas to excel in the Knowledge Age—the era in\nwhich economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics\nand biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established\nfountainhead of advanced knowledge? How can we reasonably expect the youth of Dallas—a\ngroup that I know people like Gordie and the good folks in this room care very much about—if\nwe aren’t providing them with top-notch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\nEconomists may quibble about a lot of things, but they are united on this: Education pays off.\nWe can see it in wage data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The U.S. economy today\nis far different than the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and\n5\n\n\ffactories. Agriculture represents less than 2 percent of our national economy. Oil, gas and mining\naccount for 5 percent. Manufacturing employs nearly 10 percent of our workforce. Roughly 80\npercent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of\nthe nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs. In Texas, average hourly wages in 2008\nwere $77.22 for internal medicine doctors, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer\nsoftware engineers and $29.70 for registered nurses, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics\nestimates. Those are handsome earnings compared to Texas’ overall average hourly rate of\n$18.90. We want as many of our people as possible working in those higher income brackets.\nAnd the only way to accomplish that is to build our prowess in higher education.\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. Tell me how\nmany factories you see. You won’t see one—at least not any of the old-fashioned kind with\nsmokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel\nbuildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains.\nThose brains are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I just described.\nThe brain is to this Knowledge Age what the motor was to the Industrial Age. And education is\nthe oil, the fuel that drives the knowledge economy forward.\nWe need more of that brain power, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands\nof the world’s best and brightest here in Dallas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from\nCalifornia and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no\nsubstitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its\ncommitment to building Big D and all the benefits it would bring to the arts and civic and\neducational communities on top of the economic muscle it would add.\nI referred to Egypt at the beginning. Here’s the punch line. If any of you leave this room today\nwilling to accept the fact that Dallas, Texas, does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by\neither U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities, then you are not\nthe Dallas-ites whom I know and love. If any of you are willing to accept that David Daniel at\nthe University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at Southern Methodist University or Daniel\nPodolsky at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center or Victor Boschini at Texas\nChristian University or Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington is fighting with one\nhand tied behind his back because the powers that be in Texas cannot rise above parochialism\nand give to this city what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or\nSan Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then,\nwell, you, my friends, are, as they say, in Egypt—suffering a serious case of denial.\nThank you.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Somerset Maugham,\nDon Ameche and Kenneth Arrow)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Tom [Granger], for that kind introduction.\nComing in from the airport, I again saw that fabled bumper sticker calling on local voters to\n“Keep Austin Weird.” It reminded me of the old saw that Washington is 10 square miles\nsurrounded by reality.\nAustin might be justly proud to consider itself 272 square miles surrounded by normality. But I\nknow better. When I made my hapless run for the U.S. Senate in 1994, I managed to visit every\nnook and cranny of this state. I know from personal experience that, thankfully, there is nothing\nnormal about Texas.\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed\nfrom Nip ’n Tuck, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in\nthe Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas\nUnmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but they were proud Texans and called themselves\n“cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in\nbattle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small\nfeat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family\nannals. Old “Sidestroke” then walked back to Nip ’n Tuck to become a dirt farmer.\nHe arrived home broke; he could not immediately afford a mule, so until he could, he hitched a\nplow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was\npromptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and\nprospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed his executor to auction off all he had\naccumulated—his house, his equipment, the works—so his net worth could be calculated in hard\ncurrency.\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone\nrecords the dates of his and his wife Nancy’s births and deaths, and the dates of his service in\nboth the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all\nthe world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44,378.34.” That’s nearly $1 million\nin today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will\nrequired his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\nInteresting as all of that is, I know you didn’t ask me to return tonight to regale you with the\nlegends and lore of my wife’s family. You asked me here to provide insight into something even\nmore resilient and more “weird” than William “Sidestroke” Miles—our economy. So let’s get\ndown to business.\n\n1\n\n\fAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking group, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), met last Tuesday and Wednesday. Our statement—released\nlike clockwork at the conclusion of every FOMC meeting precisely at 1:15 p.m. Central time—\nsummed up our collective wisdom: With a host of caveats, we noted that activity in the\nAmerican economy has continued to pick up and appears to be on the mend. Despite this\nprogress, however, we remain vigilant.\nLet me explain why.\nJust this spring, economic conditions were drastically different than they are today. We were\nengaged in battle against an attack that ravaged our economy on four fronts. First: a collapse in\nhome building, the worst we’d seen since the Great Depression. Second: a reversal of wealth—\nthe worst decline in real or nominal terms that we can find in data that begin in 1952. Third: a\nfinancial panic, complete with extreme risk aversion and a credit contraction in securities and\ndirect credit markets. And last but not least: a bank credit crunch.\nA severe contraction had taken root beginning in the fall of 2008, and the Federal Reserve, as the\nmonetary authority of the United States, was duty-bound to do everything within its power to\nmitigate the damage. Our task was no less than to drag the global economy abruptly and\nforcefully from the edge of the abyss.\nI believe we will be judged by history as having done so. Time will tell, of course. But this much\nI know: The policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve, combined with the inherent resiliency\nof the American economy, have helped us reverse the onslaught on three of those four fronts.\nDespite deterioration in nonresidential construction, the housing sector appears to be stabilizing.\nWith regard to wealth, after plunging 24 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from mid 2007\nthrough the first quarter of this year, net worth across all American households rose slightly in\nthe second quarter and will likely be found to have risen in the third. And, after surging to\nincredibly high levels, interest rate spreads have returned to near-normalcy in the commercial\npaper and mortgage markets and are returning to Earth in the bond market.\nEfforts to free up bank credit have helped slow the pace at which banks have tightened their\ncredit standards. The latest reports we have received from bank lending officers, released just\nyesterday, confirm this. However, with the lagging effects of loan quality problems, difficulties\nin the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over regulatory reform, a full resuscitation\nof bank credit has yet to take place and will take considerable time.\nThe progress we’ve made on each of these fronts is most certainly a welcome relief, but\nquestions remain. Where are we headed, and when will we get there?\nAs we closed out the summer, I pointed out in an interview with the Dallas Morning News that\nthere were good reasons to expect fairly strong output growth—what an economist would call\n“above trend growth”—in the second half of this year.1 The reason? I like to call it the “Johnny\nMercer effect,” after the great Hollywood lyricist of the 1940s: Growth follows almost\nautomatically if you “ac-cen-chu-ate the positive and e-lim-i-nate the negative.”2\n1\n2\n\n“Recession Over, Dallas Fed Chief Says, But Jobs Lag,” by Brendan Case, Dallas Morning News, Aug. 26, 2009.\n“Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Harold Arlen, 1944.\n2\n\n\fThat’s essentially what we saw in the third quarter. Fixed investment flattened out and ceased to\nbe a drag on the economy, eliminating an important negative from the GDP calculus. Consumer\nspending, which was neutral in the first half, became a strong positive. And exports and\ninventory investment did a 180, flipping from sources of weakness to sources of strength.3\nNow, I’ve often thought that economic forecasters seem to be cursed—or maybe blessed, I\nsuppose, dependent upon your point-of-view—with a short-term memory: They tend to\nextrapolate only the most recent trends into the future. As if goosed by the more optimistic tone\nof the latest GDP release, many now believe that solid output growth will extend into the first\nhalf of next year. The latest Blue Chip survey, for example, shows that professional forecasters\nexpect GDP growth averaging 2.8 percent in the first half of 2010.\nI am wary of the consensus view. For a good while now, I’ve suggested that we are more likely\nto see a more uneven recovery—not a “V”-shaped recovery but something more akin to a check\nmark, where the elongated arm of that check mark inclines at a slope that is less than desirable\nand might possibly be repressed by an occasional pause or several quarters of weak growth.\nWhy a check mark?\nSeveral recent sources of strength are likely to wane as we head into next year. Cash-for-clunkers\nand the first-time-homebuyer tax credit have both shifted demand forward, increasing sales today\nat the expense of sales tomorrow. Neither of these programs can be repeated with any real hope\nof achieving anywhere near the same effect: The more demand you steal from the future, the less\nfuture demand there is for you to steal. The general tax cuts and government spending increases\nincluded in this year’s fiscal stimulus package won’t have their peak impact on the level of GDP\nuntil sometime in 2010, but their peak impact on the growth of GDP has come and gone; the\nfiscal stimulus continues to drive GDP upward, compared with what it would otherwise have\nbeen, but the increments to GDP are beginning to shrink. And, as we all know, the shot in the\narm that our economy is receiving from inventory adjustments is, while welcome, inherently\ntransitory.\nWhat about growth in the longer term—the second half of 2010 and beyond? American\nhouseholds have finally come to realize that they’ve been playing the part of the grasshopper in\nAesop’s fable: They see that our previous spending boom was financed by somewhat reckless\ndisregard for tomorrow by over-eager creditors feeding their desire for unsustainable leveraging\nof their income and balance sheets and, for the nation as a whole, by increases in overseas\nborrowing. That reality has been largely absorbed, and consumer spending is growing again—\nalbeit from a lower base and at a slower pace. I doubt it will recover its previous vigor for some\ntime to come. I expect that the strong bounce-back in consumer demand that we’ve come to\nexpect in recoveries past will be absent this time around as Americans recalibrate the proportion\nof their income and wealth that they need to save versus what they need to consume. We need\n\n3\n\nExports did contribute almost 1.5 percentage points to growth in the third quarter, reversing a recent string of four\nconsecutive negative contributions—but net exports remained a drag.\n3\n\n\fnot become a nation as parsimonious as William Miles, but we are going to have to be more antthan grasshopper-like in our behavior.4\nWith a likely subpar showing from household spending, one other candidate as a source of\ngrowth is government spending. We should be hesitant to become overly dependent on it. As\nconsumer credit conditions gradually improve, any boost the economy gets from growth in\ngovernment purchases will increasingly be offset by reductions in household spending—people\nwill save to meet a higher prospective tax burden.\nUnfortunately, this prospect of an uneven and comparatively weak recovery—in combination\nwith excess capacity and uncertainty about the impact of new government initiatives and\nregulation—is taking its toll on business confidence. Firms are hesitant to add plant and\nequipment. In my surveys of corporate CEOs with significant capex wherewithal—a personal\nsurvey I conduct religiously before every FOMC meeting—it appears that those who are\nbeginning to budget expanding plant and equipment are less inclined to do so here at home and\nmore interested in doing so abroad in areas they consider to have greater risk-adjusted profit\npotential.\nMost painfully, they remain hesitant to add labor. I’m sure you all saw the headlines last\nFriday—despite a continuing decline in payroll losses and initial unemployment claims, the\njobless rate in this country has officially reached a 26-year high of 10.2 percent, not counting\nthose who have given up looking for work. Far fewer of you likely saw the latest numbers on\nlabor productivity: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics release last week, nonfarm labor\nproductivity increased at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. That is the highest\nquarterly increase we’ve seen in six years.\nWhat does this tell us? After a prolonged period of payroll growth, firms are using this downturn\nto reorganize and retool. To control costs and preserve margins that can cushion the top line,\nemployers are learning to do more with less. They are squeezing all the productivity they can\nfrom their employees. You can get a snapshot of this in the recent round of earnings releases by\nthe 453 of the S&P 500 companies that have reported third quarter performance thus far:\nEarnings for these companies were down 10 percent year-over-year. But top-line growth—total\nrevenue growth—was down 14 percent. As long as this condition obtains, companies can hardly\nbe expected to add to payrolls.\nThis is not surprising if you think about it. Before the crisis, we had a long period of economic\nexpansion and easy access to money. Historically, the longer the expansion or period of\nprosperity, the more complacent businesses become. A growing economy, like sailing in a\nfollowing sea and pleasant weather for days on end, weakens the discipline to run a tight ship.\nBut once a storm strikes, captains of industry have no choice but to batten down the hatches and\nreef their sails. The more intense the storm, the longer it takes for the inefficiencies incurred\nduring the previous expansions to recede from memory, even after fair weather returns. I would\nthink that in this recovery period the willingness to rehire or expand capital expenditures will be\n4\n\nOf course, there are alternative versions of Aesop’s fable. In 1924, W. Somerset Maugham wrote a story titled\n“The Ant and the Grasshopper” about two brothers: one a hard worker and a saver and the other not. In the end, the\n“grasshopper” brother marries a rich widow who ups and dies and leaves him a fortune. In the 1988 film Things\nChange, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version where the grasshopper eats the ant.\n4\n\n\flong in coming. Chastised by recent experience, businesses will continue to run tight ships, with\nall resources, including labor, being driven to maximum efficiency.\nIt may be some time before significant job growth occurs and even longer before we see\nmeaningful declines in the unemployment rate.\nSo we have a mixed picture for economic growth down the road, despite the pickup we’ve seen\nlately. What are the implications of all this for monetary policy?\nWith financial-market conditions normalizing—if not yet fully normal—most of the special\nprograms that the Federal Reserve introduced last winter to backstop bank and nonbank credit\nhave either already unwound or are rapidly doing so. For example, the special facility we put in\nplace to revive the commercial paper market when it succumbed to paralysis last year—a facility\nthat expanded our balance sheet by $350 billion at its peak usage level—has fallen to under $10\nbillion as the market has been restored. As to the longer-lived asset purchases we have made,\nnow that mortgage-finance spreads have narrowed, our purchases of mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) are tapering off. We expect those transactions—which will total up to $1.25 trillion—to\nbe executed by the end of next year’s first quarter.\nA legacy of MBS acquisitions is a Fed balance sheet that has more than doubled in size. This\nexpanded balance sheet has as its counterpart a greatly elevated level of bank reserves. Banks,\nseeking liquidity and avoiding risk, have so far been content to let their reserves sit at the Federal\nReserve, earning a modicum of interest. Ultimately, as confidence returns, these funds will be\nused to support an expansion in bank lending, increasing the velocity of base money in our\neconomy. That would not necessarily be a bad thing, within limits, given all the idle resources in\nthe economy at present. Of course, the Fed must be wary that velocity does not explode and\ncreate inflation pressures resulting from too much money chasing too few goods and services. If\ncredit growth at some point threatens to become excessive, we have the tools to rein it in,\nranging from selling the assets we have acquired so as to suck up excess money, to adjusting the\nrate we pay on excess reserves, to utilizing other techniques such as large-scale reverse\nrepurchase agreements, or “repos,” to even raising the Fed funds rate.\nThe press and the markets are eager to know when we might undertake a tightening in policy.\nThe answer to this question is … “It depends.” Our mandate is to pursue the maximum level of\nemployment consistent with long-term price stability. So, when and how rapidly we reduce our\naccommodative policy must depend on fine judgments about how quickly the real economy gets\nback on track without jeopardizing our longer-run price-stability goal. As noted in our most\nrecent statement, the FOMC will consider a variety of economic indicators—including resource\nslack, inflation trends and inflation expectations—when making this decision. But for the\nforeseeable future, the FOMC considers policy to be appropriately calibrated to the times.\nMy own judgment—based partly on available estimates of slack, but also on the behavior of\nprices, and informed by the anecdotal input I receive monthly from business leaders as to their\nintentions—is that inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time, and thus our current\npolicy is appropriate. Of course, I recognize that our measures of slack and our understanding of\nthe determinants of inflation are uncertain. And agile business leaders can change plans on a\ndime. Being what some believe to be the most hawkish member of the FOMC, I am very\nReagan-esque in my evaluation of inflationary potential: I trust but continually seek to verify that\n5\n\n\finflation is not raising its ugly head. So, as I’ve always done, I will keep a close eye on price\ndevelopments as they unfold.\nRight now, I see more immediate deflationary pressures than inflationary ones. Yet I am fully\naware that the law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. For instance,\nhaving spent a few years early in my banking career as a foreign exchange advisor to investors\nand corporations, I am particularly mindful of the risks we run by stating in FOMC statements\nthat we expect to maintain the Fed funds rate at “exceptionally low levels” for “an extended\nperiod.” This could fuel the “carry” trade, whereby speculators—assuming U.S. rates will remain\nunchanged over a reasonable time horizon—can borrow plentiful amounts of dollars cheaply and\ninvest them in securities denominated in other currencies that yield more or offer greater returns,\nin the process driving those securities and currencies to prices beyond their equilibrium levels.\nWere this to become a disorderly influence, I would expect the FOMC and other authorities to\ncraft an appropriate remedy.\nTom, here is the bottom line: The Federal Reserve has done what it can to prevent Depression\n2.0 and the deflation that one would have expected might accompany economic collapse. It will\ntake some time, in my opinion, to get back on a steady pathway to a pace of growth that will\nresult in significant job creation. We are in for a long slog. We had a snapback in growth in the\nthird quarter and can expect that will continue in the current quarter. But looking into 2010 and\nperhaps to 2011, the most likely outcome is for growth to be suboptimal, unemployment to\nremain a vexing problem and inflation to remain subdued.\nMind you, you should take economic forecasts—even my own—with a big grain of salt. Jamie\nGalbraith’s dad, John Kenneth Galbraith, may have been more right than econometricians like to\nthink when he said that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look\nrespectable.”\nNobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow has his own perspective on forecasting. During\nWorld War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with\nindividuals who were charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead\nweather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed\nstatistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps’ weather forecasts were\nno more accurate than random rolls of a die.\nUnderstandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s\nrecollection of his superiors’ response was priceless:\n“The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them\nfor planning purposes.”\nTom asked me to provide you tonight with my forecast for the economy. This evening, I have\ndone as asked, drawing upon the models and judgment of the Federal Reserve, which are among\nthe most complex and comprehensive in the world. But we cannot lose sight of the unfortunate\nfact that, despite our best efforts, no one can precisely predict the future. While we know where\nthe economy has been and believe we understand the gearing of the economy as well as anybody\ncan, we cannot know with certainty where it’s headed. That said, I hope my musings this evening\nhave been better than “no good” and are of some assistance to you for your planning purposes.\n6\n\n\fThank you for listening. Now, in the tradition that is hallmark of Federal Reserve officials, I\nwould be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Role of Globalization in the\nFinancial Crisis and Recovery\nRemarks at the O’Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom Conference\nSMU Cox School of Business\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nOctober 16, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Role of Globalization in the Financial Crisis and Recovery\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, President [R. Gerald] Turner.\nIt is common for a speaker at SMU to say how honored he is to be introduced by Gerald Turner.\nIn my case, it is especially true. My wife‘s—Nancy‘s—family has been involved in SMU almost\nfrom the time Dallas Hall was the sole building on ―The Hill.‖ Today, I am speaking in a\nbuilding named for my father-in-law, the late, great Jim Collins, Class of ‘37, who turned his\nenergy to serving Dallas in the U.S. Congress after building a business: Fidelity Union Life. That\nbusiness, which was sold to Allianz of Germany in the late 1970s, was the source of the funding\nfor every facility on this campus with the name Collins or Sharp or Altshuler attached to it.\nCountless Collinses and Sharps and even two Fishers have been educated here. I know SMU\nwell, and I knew Jim Collins as well as you could know any man. He would be very proud of\nwhat you have done as president of SMU and would consider you one of the greats, Gerald. And\nI know he would be very pleased to see his son-in-law given such a nice introduction, speaking\nhere in the Crum Auditorium, attached to the building the university so graciously named in his\nhonor. Thank you, Mr. President.\nToday, you are going to hear from people who know firsthand what it means to operate a\nbusiness in a globalized economy—particularly a business located in this unique part of the\ncountry, the global business nexus we call Dallas. Tom [Falk] and Rich [Templeton] are no\nstrangers to the challenges and opportunities that await American businesses in an interconnected\nworld, and I am confident that you all will benefit from their special insight.\nI‘d like to speak more about the context in which global business is conducted, in order to set the\nstage for what I expect Tom and Rich will be saying.\nWe have all read the headlines and listened to the pundits‘ chatter about a looming threat of\n―deglobalization.‖ A slew of armchair analysts, calling to our attention historic declines in world\ntrade and a rise of protectionist instincts, have lamented what they believe to be an impending\nreversal of globalization.\nThis morning, I will argue that a decline in trade flows, at least to some degree, was to be\nexpected during this tumultuous period, the most severe global financial and economic crisis in\ndecades. I will then turn to protectionism, the bête noire of internationally minded business\noperators and policymakers. And then I will conclude with some comments on where we are\nlikely to go from here, making the point that globalization is still very much alive and that, like\nthe music of Wagner, all is not as bad as it sounds.\nAs usual, I will speak only for myself, not for any other member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Federal Reserve System. Which is fitting, for I will draw not only on my\nperspective as a Federal Reserve policymaker, but also on the four years I spent negotiating trade\nagreements for our country.\n\n1\n\n\fLet‘s begin with what the pundits have right: Our recent economic crisis has led to some truly\nhistoric declines in world trade. According to the International Monetary Fund‘s most recent\nWorld Economic Outlook, global exports of goods and services, by volume, will decline over 11\npercent this year, with exports of advanced economies projected to fare worse than those of their\nemerging and developing peers.1 If you look to the history books, you will learn that, by some\nmeasures, the pace of international trade‘s decline in the first year of this crisis was even greater\nthan what we experienced during the Great Depression.2\nEvidence of the harsh nature of the contraction in trade we have recently experienced can be\nfound in international shipping costs. For years, I have used the Baltic Dry Index, a price index\nthat captures movements in the shipping market for dry bulk commodities, as one indicator of the\nrelative health of international trade flows. In the span of less than seven months, this index took\nan incredible nosedive, plummeting over 94 percent by the early part of December 2008. The\nprice data for leasing ―Capesize‖ vessels—one of the best indicators of shipments of iron ore, a\ncritical ingredient to the key building blocks of infrastructure worldwide—is even more volatile:\nThey reached a peak of nearly $235,000 per day in the summer of 2008 and, since that time,\nhave fallen over 80 percent.3 Data for container ships, the carriers of many consumer durables,\nare similarly bleak, as are the data for the rails that carry goods from the ports to the distribution\npoints of consumer outlets. And, if you‘d read page C1 from today‘s edition of the second-best\nnewspaper in the world, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, you would have seen that Alliance and\nDFW airports—in addition to others, like San Francisco, LAX and JFK—experienced sizable\ncargo business declines last year (although, for DFW, relatively less than its peers).4 While the\nnumbers were not broken out, it is likely that at least some of that downturn could be attributed\nto a decline in goods shipped between international destinations. In the blink of an eye, we went\nfrom shortage-driven inflation in transportation costs to dramatic overcapacity and slack. A little\nover a year and a half ago, daily lease prices of railcars in the United States were escalating\nrapidly; as of Oct. 1 of this year, roughly 178,000 railroad-owned freight cars, which placed end\nto end would total some 2,900 miles, have been laid up in storage for at least five months,\naccording to what Matt Rose, the CEO of BNSF, recently told me. This is something of an\nimprovement from a comparable car count for the previous month of 185,000, but it nonetheless\nprovides a graphic indication of the enormous amount of slack in idle rail assets and the\ncompression that had occurred in final demand for finished goods produced both domestically\nand abroad.\nThe broader, aggregate data speak to the implosion in trade that we have witnessed. As of June\nof this year, our quarterly imports, by volume, had fallen just over 20 percent after peaking in the\nthird quarter of 2007. A similar measure of American exports, by volume, peaked later—as the\n\n1\n\nWorld Economic Outlook: Sustaining the Recovery. International Monetary Fund, October 2009. Data provided by\nHaver Analytics.\n2\nFurther analysis in a pending piece by Mark Wynne at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas cites the work of two\nwell-known economic historians—Barry Eichengreen and Kevin H. O‘Rourke (their analysis can be found at\nhttp://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3421). Starting at the peak in industrial production that preceded each\ndownturn, Eichengreen and O‘Rourke show that the pace of decline in the first year of our current travails bests that\nof the first year of the Great Depression.\n3\nNumbers from Bloomberg.\n4\n―Alliance Cargo Traffic Off 19 Percent in 2008,‖ by Sandra Baker, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Oct. 16, 2009, p.\nC1.\n2\n\n\fcrisis went global in the second quarter of 2008—but still managed to drop roughly 15 percent\nthrough this June.\nThese are just some of the doomsday figures that naysayers have highlighted to portend an\nonslaught of deglobalization. To be sure, these data are quite startling and, indeed, quite historic.\nBut do they portend that deglobalization is taking root? I think not.\nAs most of you know, I am not a trained economist. I earned my bona fides like many of you in\nthis room—in the world of private business, after earning an M.B.A. at Stanford: the SMU of\nCalifornia. That said, I have spent enough time around economists to learn two things:\n1. Number one: Stanley Fischer, my much-revered but spelling-impaired\nnamesake at the Bank of Israel (he insists on inserting a ‗c‘ in Fisher), was\nright when he quipped that there are three kinds of economists: those who can\ncount and those who cannot.\n2. Number three: Simple questions rarely, if ever, have simple answers.\nBefore asserting that ―deglobalization‖ is occurring, we must understand what has driven these\nglobal trade declines and look behind the simple headline figures and ―instant analysis‖—my\nfavorite oxymoron—that accompanies the assertion of the Eeyores of punditry who claim that\nglobalization is at risk.\nLet‘s start by examining how the dramatic trade declines of the past year compare with what we\notherwise might have expected in the midst of a global recession and whether a reversal of\nglobalization, or maybe something else, is to blame. My colleagues at the Dallas Fed‘s\nGlobalization and Monetary Policy Institute—specifically, its director, Mark Wynne, and one of\nits senior economists, Jian Wang—have been doing just that.5 I want to share some of their\npreliminary findings with you.\nFirst, a look to the dictionary: What exactly do we mean by globalization? Let me give you my\nCliffsNotes definition: Globalization is the process by which national borders become\nincreasingly open to international transfers of goods, services, capital, people, ideas and a variety\nother economic inputs and outputs. To businessmen and women, globalization is about managing\nto greater efficiency by driving the costs of goods sold, expenses, inventory sourcing and\nmanagement to optimization. It is also about maximizing market reach and expanding top line\nvolume. For the business operator, globalization is a means to better profits so as to maximize\nreturns to a company‘s stakeholders. You will no doubt hear much about this from Tom and\nRich.\nTo macroeconomists, globalization is about the integration of national markets into one global\nmarket. Fluctuations in the flows of goods and services may certainly be necessary for, or\nsymptomatic of, such integration, but the extent to which any economy can be said to be\nglobalized—the extent to which a domestic economy is integrated with economies elsewhere—is\nbest judged on the basis of how close its domestic prices for various goods and services are to\nthose on world markets.\n\n5\n\nTheir efforts will be published as part of the Dallas Fed‘s Economic Letter series.\n3\n\n\fIn the presence of transportation costs, barriers to trade and so on, we can reasonably expect that\nthere will be a difference between the domestic price of a good and the price that prevails\nglobally. The size of this difference or distortion determines just how much of the good we will\nimport and consume. With the removal of these barriers, that distortion will decline, domestic\nprices will fall and trade will increase.\nIt is possible for trade volumes to increase without an integration of markets. While trade growth\nis necessary for globalization, it is by no means sufficient. A domestic boom, for example, could\nleave us clamoring for all kinds of goods and services, in all price ranges, without driving down\nthose domestic price distortions. The same could happen in reverse: A global recession that\nreduces import demand would likely lead to a decline in trade but might not have any effect on\nthe wedge between domestic and international prices.\nThat, arguably, is largely what took place from last fall through the first half of this year. As the\ncrisis spread from North America to the rest of the globe, the dramatic deterioration in economic\nprospects and the contagious seizure that afflicted financial markets in the advanced economies\nfollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers last September caused the markets for emergingmarket exports to dry up, engulfing them in the global downturn.\nAs policymakers, we would prefer to study price differentials when looking for evidence of\nglobalization. Trade growth, again, is necessary but insufficient. And alternatively, evidence of\ntrade decline is likely necessary, but insufficient, as evidence of that alleged multisyllable\nphenomenon, deglobalization.\nUnfortunately, we lack the reliable global price data needed to perform a more thorough analysis\non that front. As such, we must move forward—cautiously—with our discussion of trade flows.\nIf we posit that deglobalization is not the likely culprit behind the recent historic declines we\nhave witnessed in global trade, we have to ask ourselves what other factors might be at play.\nWith regard to fluctuations in international trade relative to movements in the business cycle,\ntwo facts are worth mentioning. First, exports and imports are, in economists‘ lingo,\n―procyclical.‖ In other words, they move in tandem with GDP. Second, swings in exports and\nimports are far more volatile than those of the business cycle. The average volatility, or standard\ndeviation, of GDP is about 1.7 percent. For exports, that number is over three times greater, at\n5.6 percent, and for imports, 5.2 percent.\nIn short, international trade flows move in the same direction as—and are a lot more volatile\nthan—the overall economy.\nWhy is this the case? Despite innovations that now allow market participants to pass what we\nonce defined as ―nontradable‖ assets across national borders, the composition of international\ntrade is still heavily skewed toward goods. Goods, by value, make up close to 70 and 84 percent\nof our exports and imports, respectively. More important, most of those goods fall into the\ncategory of ―durables.‖ In 2008, for example, more than 60 percent of American traded-goods\ntrade, excluding energy, was classified as durable.\nA durable good can be loosely thought of as anything with a relatively longer lifespan.\nConsumers and producers make use of these products for an extended period. As an economist\n4\n\n\fmight say, they provide utility over time. For a firm, this might include large manufacturing\nequipment. For a household, it might include a car or a refrigerator. Or, in the case of my friend\nand neighbor, Jerry Jones, it might include an 11,500-square-foot, flat-screen television that\nfootballs can reach. Demand for these goods—except for in the case of Jerry, who is a unique\nrisk taker!—is quite volatile. When the economy hits a wall, as it did last year, households\npostpone these larger purchases, and firms rein in previously scheduled capital expenditures.\nThat is what we‘ve seen this year: In the final three months of 2008 and beginning of 2009—\nagain, as the crisis went global—worldwide demand for durable goods fell substantially,\nregistering annualized quarter-over-quarter declines in some developing nations that are well into\nthe double digits. Given the contribution that these goods make to international trade, it should\ncome as less of a surprise that global exports and imports dried up in the midst of the most severe\nglobal recession since World War II.\nThere is another reason we might expect a relatively sharper decline in trade flows during a\nglobal economic downturn—one that is tied to globalization itself. Economists call it ―vertical\nspecialization‖ or ―internationalized production.‖ The other gentlemen you will hear from today\nmight know it simply as doing business in a global world.\nMany goods today are manufactured in more than one place. Firms are no longer beholden to the\nlabor and capital available within their own national borders. They can source various stages of\nproduction from anywhere in the world, using each host nation‘s comparative advantage to drive\ndown costs and expand profit margins. Whereas in previous periods, trade was composed solely\nof finished products, the story is now much more complex. Firms export materials to countries\naround the world and receive finished—or perhaps near-finished—goods that they can then sell\nat home or abroad or ship away for further finishing.\nWhen global demand takes a hit, we don‘t just see a drop-off in the international exchange of\nfinished goods. Intermediate products that multinational firms trade in this globalized production\nprocess fall by the wayside as well. Trade losses are compounded, relative to what they might\nhave been before globalization began.\nAgain, it should come as no surprise, then, that as the global economy declines, trade flows\ndecline even more.\nWhat has come as a surprise, however, is that the magnitude of this decline has been over and\nabove what we might have expected based on our understanding of fundamentals.\nIn the past, econometric models with only two variables—American income and dollar\nstrength—have done reasonably well explaining quarterly fluctuations in our imports. Also, and\nnot surprisingly, models that contain foreign income and dollar strength have typically done well\nexplaining quarterly fluctuations in American exports.\nUntil last fall.\nI am given to reminding the economists at the Dallas Fed that my undergraduate professor, John\nKenneth Galbraith, used to say that economic modeling and forecasting was invented to ―make\nastrology look respectable.‖ So I have asked them to dig deeper into what might have caused this\n5\n\n\fbreakdown. As you may recall, there was no shortage of stories in the financial media last fall\nabout the drying up of trade finance and credit and its detrimental effect on trade flows. Given\nthe nature of the crisis and the abundance of this anecdotal evidence, it is reasonable to assume\nthat a severe reduction of trade finance may well have been the culprit.\nTrade finance is, broadly, every kind of loan, insurance policy or guarantee tied to an\ninternational good or service transaction. It includes a range of tools: from direct credit extended\nby an exporter to government-backed guarantees to letters of credit issued by commercial and\nmultilateral banks and private insurers. Trade finance instruments can even act as pure risk\nhedges, insuring against the myriad potential problems (commercial, political and the like) that\ncan arise in international transactions.\nWhile hard data on trade-specific finance are difficult to obtain, there are a few quantifiable\nmeasures we can point to as evidence of a drying up of this important trade tool. Since the\nsummer of 2007, private capital coming into and out of the U.S. has plunged. In the span of one\nyear, these flows fell from 15 percent of our GDP to zero. Declines in trade credit were similarly\ndramatic. The contraction in trade credit available, for example, to Korean firms in the fourth\nquarter of last year was the most severe since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. And for Brazilian\nfirms, the contraction was more severe than during the real devaluation crisis in the early part of\nthis decade.\nWhen a global flight to quality takes hold—something we‘ve witnessed to a startling degree\nduring this financial crisis—we might expect that investors, banks and firms would limit their\nexposure to relatively risky nations. Surprisingly, though, emerging markets were not the only\nvictims. Firms in the U.S., Japan and Germany, for instance, also saw record drops—literally\nunprecedented at the end of last year—in trade credit liabilities.\nThe subject of trade finance is very much on the front burner in the debate on the need for a new\nregulatory regime governing financial institutions. Had you read page 4 of yesterday‘s Financial\nTimes, you would have seen an intriguing article discussing the accounting treatment of trade\ncredit and an assertion that the ―shortage of trade finance [during the financial crisis] was\nresponsible for more than 10–15 per cent of the fall [in global trade].‖ It went on to say that ―…\nbankers warn that a diminished capacity for trade-related lending could create bottlenecks that\nwill slow or stop the recovery.‖6\nHere is the point: The dramatic turndown in trade we have witnessed was the result not of some\ninvidious plan to undo globalization. It resulted from a turndown in the domestic gearing of the\nworld‘s larger economies, which spread to the emerging economies that feed into demand from\nthose larger economies, and it was exacerbated by the financial crisis, including a clampdown in\ntrade credit.\nThis does not mean globalization is being undone. It does not mean that ―deglobalization‖ has\nbegun.\n\n6\n\n―Regulators Urged to Loosen Credit Restrictions on Banks,‖ by Alan Beattie, Financial Times, Oct. 15, 2009, p.\nA4.\n\n6\n\n\fThat said, we must remain ever vigilant to forces that we know can undo the good that has come\nfrom globalization. The biggest threat of all is the political instinct when times are tough to\nembrace protectionism.\nToday, protectionism is more subtle than in the past. Governments no longer have to resort to\nexplicit tariffs and quotas to stave off the inflow of foreign goods and services. They can be more\ncreative. At the Dallas Fed, we commonly watch indicators released by the World Trade\nOrganization such as antidumping investigations. While these numbers are still well within the\nexperience of the past decade, their increase throughout 2008 and in the first half of 2009 is not\nsomething we can simply ignore.\nOne cannot be too blunt about the dangers of protectionism. It is, quite frankly, the crack cocaine\nof economics: It may provide politicians with a temporary high, yet it is instantly addictive and\ninevitably proves debilitating and fatal for an economy. We must keep a watchful eye on quick\nfixes—like the imposition of tariffs on affordable Chinese tires—to make sure this dangerous\ninstinct does not get out of hand. We cannot forget that what made the Great Depression ―great‖\nor the even worse 23-year ―Long Depression‖ that closed out the 19th century ―long,‖ was the\nonslaught of protectionist measures enacted by a host of countries around the world. We would\nbe well-served to remember that lesson.\nHaving said all that, I must tell you, as a former trade representative, I am encouraged by recent\ndevelopments on the trade front. For example, we hear little these days from Sen. Schumer and\nSen. Graham (or even the Secretary of the Treasury) about the need to take punitive actions in\nretribution for what they consider insufficient flexibility in the exchange rate of the Chinese\ncurrency. While I disagree, from a free-trader‘s perspective, on the Section 421 action taken on\nChinese tires—an action that only hurts lower-income groups in the U.S. who buy those cheaper\ntires—I assume, without any more knowledge than what I learned about the way things operated\nwhen I was a trade representative during the second term of the Clinton administration, that the\ncurrent administration undertook that action as an inexpensive way to placate an important\nconstituency and that there might have been far more expensive alternatives on the table. And I\ntake heart that while Congress has not seen fit to act on the U.S.–Korea Free Trade Agreement—\nan agreement I have long championed—it has at least been agreed to between negotiating parties\nand has occasioned an agreement between Korea and the European Union that was initialed\nyesterday (and modeled in-fact on the Korea–U.S. agreement).\nWhile I doubt the practicability of letting the G-20 or the IMF become global regulatory forums\nor rule-making bodies that trump sovereign authorities of their member nations, I also take heart\nthat at least these forums are being used proactively to discuss common problems and keep the\nmomentum for positive financial reform and continued trade liberalization moving forward. That\nmomentum could have easily gone into reverse under the difficult global financial and economic\nconditions that have obtained.\nThis does not mean that those who believe, as I do, that a more fully interconnected, globalized\neconomy leads to the most efficient allocation of resources (which in turn leads to a more\nproductive, efficient and prosperous environment for American businesses) should let down their\nguard. It does mean that we have cause for optimism. Globalization is proceeding. That‘s the\ngood news. And nobody is in better position to exploit it and make it work to the benefit of their\nstakeholders than Dallas-based businesses.\n7\n\n\fThank you. And now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid\nanswering any questions you might have.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nExcerpts from Remarks Before the Texas\nChristian University Business Network of Dallas\nSeptember 29, 2009 Dallas, Texas\nBut, remember the theme here—cautious optimism. While housing is showing some signs of\nhaving reached a bottom, we need to recognize that it is a sector still on life support. The\nFederal Reserve has been buying over 70 percent of the new mortgage originations in the\nMBS market—a process that has lowered mortgage rates and increased the availability of\ncredit at affordable rates to a large swath of the market. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has announced its intention to slow its rate of mortgage acquisitions in\nthe hope that private funding will begin to emerge. And the market for the purchase of new\nhomes has also been helped tremendously by an $8,000 credit for new home buyers.\nOf course, there is some concern that the hope for a housing rebound could succumb to the\nheadwinds experienced earlier if the efforts of fiscal and monetary authorities are allowed\nexpire. Yet, that said, there is, in my opinion, a limit to the life support that can be provided\nby either the Federal Reserve on the monetary front or the Congress on the fiscal front. The\nmarket for housing will not become truly robust until market forces replace the prostheses\nof government support. We have thus indicated to the marketplace that, for our part, the\nFOMC expects we will complete the execution of our $1.25 trillion intervention in the\nmortgage-backed securities market by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n***\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have not hesitated in the past to vote against the\nmajority of the FOMC when I felt they were being too accommodative, and I have been\noutspoken on the dangers of prolonged monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed’s\nspecial credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have\nbegun to function in a more normal manner. And my colleagues have come to accept the\narguments I made regarding the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the\nTreasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal\nReserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be\nconverted to bank loans, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary\npolicy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin\nas soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the\nlending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion.\nI am not alone on this front. I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee will stand and deliver in a timely way. And I expect that when it comes time to\n\n\ftighten monetary policy, my colleagues and I will move with an alacrity that, if needed, will\nbe equal in speed and intensity to that with which we pursued monetary accommodation.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W.

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks Before the 55th Annual Meeting\nof the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Ralph [Babb] for that kind introduction.\nA little over a year ago, the nation was staring straight into the jaws of economic ruin. The\nFederal Reserve stepped into the breach and did what central bankers are called to do: We\nassumed the role of lender of last resort, enacting a sequel to the playbook written by the Bank of\nEngland over 180 years ago following the Panic of 1825. We opened the flood gates and lent\nfreely, instituting unconventional measures to keep the financial lungs of the global economy\nfrom collapsing.\nIn doing so, we took enormous risk with our reputation and with our balance sheet, expanding it\nfrom north of $800 billion before the crisis to $2 trillion today. We knew full well that this would\nlead to a gnashing of teeth about the long-term consequences of our actions, not the least of\nwhich is the potential for all the money we have pumped into the economy to spark an\ninflationary conflagration once its gears start to mesh again.\nI am going to talk to you today, first, about where the economy and inflation now stand and then\nsay a few words about the opportunities that lie before us as Texans as we move on down the\nroad.\nThe long and short of it is that there are presently some signs that the economy is stabilizing and\neven reviving in certain areas, despite mixed signals. Financial markets are continuing to\nimprove; household spending is stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses,\nsluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; businesses are making progress\nin aligning inventories, though sales are still anemic and CEOs are continuing to cut back on\nfixed investment and payrolls. Given both the monetary accommodation we at the Fed have put\nin place and the stimulus of fiscal policy, it is now reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of\neconomic growth in a context of price stability.\nThe operative words in that sentence were “gradual” and “in a context of price stability.” So, just\nwhat are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies\nin a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting in order to get\na read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase,\nwhat to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are\nstill suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from\n“post-traumatic slack syndrome.”\n\n1\n\n\fUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready\nmoney and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plant, equipment\nand payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every\nmeasure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we\nentered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in\nthe consumer’s basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above\n3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging\ntop-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve\ntheir bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their\nmanagement models and budgeting accordingly.\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income\nmarkets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall.\nWhereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and\nescalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing\npower. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too\nmany homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and\nmalls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street\nJournal reports last week, even too much champagne and bottled water.1\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic\ncommodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with\nexcess capacity and slack.\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting\ntheir behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of\nweakened demand, they are cutting prices. In the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an\nupward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data recently\nreleased, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or\nexpenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the\nyear ended in June.\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial\ncompanies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the\nthird sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is\na deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, businesses will continue to run tight\nbudgets as they try to preserve profit margins while operating in the absence of pricing power\nwith the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand. They\n\n1\n\n“Bottled-Water Price War Heats Up as Demand Falls,” Wall Street Journal, Aug. 31, 2009, p. B1, and “As\nChampagne Fizzles, Makers Squash Supply,” Wall Street Journal, Sept. 3, 2009, p. B1.\n2\n\n\fwill continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who\nremain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic\nperformance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to\nfit the new economic landscape.\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by\nfinancial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I\nwould argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having\nnormalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that\nfinancial headwinds like these take years to abate.\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in\nplace a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to\ndisposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to\ngoose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the\nmakeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net\nexports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while “C” is flaccid,\n“I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are\nexpected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40\npercent of expected GDP.\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag:\nhigher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates and the\ndebasement of the dollar driven by the government’s issuance of massive amounts of debt. These\nlong-term costs of a larger government limit the American people’s willingness to rely on the\npublic sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector\noption looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic\nstimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations.\nThe secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and\nhere at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration and the Congress will\nwork their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this\nis no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute\nand will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is\ncompounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our\ncalculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of\nthese two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to\nMedicare alone.\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling\n[his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives\nare close to their limit of tolerance of the “gross habits” of government and the net new\nindebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an\n3\n\n\fantidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given\nthe expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will\nbe a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable\ndent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke we have\nexperienced, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the\nelongated side of the mark.\nMind you, one of my college professors was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned his students\nthat “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” My\nforecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I’m\nsticking with it.\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have been outspoken on the reduced need for monetary stimulus\nin the future. Many of the Fed’s special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip\nas financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And I have been\noutspoken on the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not\nincreasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its\nbalance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans to\nthe private sector, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is\ninitiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as\nthere are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity\nof the banking system is capable of expansion. Cynics retort that “the Fed may know what to\ndo—but will it have the guts to pull the trigger?” Well, we Texans are not afraid to pull the\ntrigger (as anybody knows who has gone duck hunting with vice presidents of the United\nStates!). I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and\ndeliver in a timely way.\nRecently, a book titled In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic written by the\nWall Street Journal’s David Wessel was released. In it, he describes me as one of the “jocks” on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee who is “determined to show [his] manhood by talking\ntough about inflation and economic rectitude.…”2 He’s got that right. I am proud of it. I am paid\nto be a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity, and I aim to\nearn my pay.\nThe Fed does not pay me to promote Dallas and Texas. But I do anyway.\nI am grateful beyond belief that Ray Hunt, who was then chairman of the Dallas Fed board,\nbrought me home from eight years in Washington to be president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. I\nloved being an ambassador; I loved negotiating for my country. But you know what they say.\n“Washington is 10 square miles, surrounded by reality; Washington is Hollywood for ugly\npeople; Washington is a place where a friend is someone who stabs you in the chest.” These are\nexaggerations. But I do feel blessed to be able to work on national policy at this amazing\njuncture in economic history with the brilliant staff of the Dallas Fed and live among genuine\n2\n\nIn Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, by David Wessel, New York, N.Y.: Crown Business,\n2009, p. 124.\n4\n\n\fpeople who are hard headed, pro-business, unafraid of competition, no-nonsense and hardly\nenamored with the heavy hand of government. They give me the perspective and moral support I\nneed to make the arguments I do at that big mahogany table where the Federal Open Market\nCommittee meets.\nIt is a great source of pride to me that in 2007, Texas created almost 30 percent of all the private\nsector jobs in the nation. I delight in the fact that my Federal Reserve District was the only one in\nthe country that created jobs in 2008. Imagine that: While the nation lost over 3 million jobs in\n2008 as the peanut butter hit the fan, we managed to create 63,100 jobs in Texas.\nIt is true that our job-creating machine rolled over in the early fall, and we entered a recession\nlike the rest of the country. And yes, my staff projects that we will have up to 212,000 jobs lost\nin Texas this year. That hurts: Roughly one of every 50 people in this room has already lost or\nwill lose his or her job this year. My expectation, however, is that the cut is going to be less deep\nhere and require fewer stitches than elsewhere. I expect that we will come out of the recession\nchute not only quicker but stronger than many other parts of the country.\nWhy? Because we have the right stuff. If you didn’t see it, you should read and re-read the\nEconomist magazine’s cover article and special section on Texas in the July 11 issue—this little\nbaby right here. It cites many things that are music to my ears. For example, it points out that\nChief Executive magazine ranks Texas as the best state in which to conduct business. It goes on\nto say that Texas, and I quote, “has coped well with the recession, with an unemployment rate\ntwo points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession …\n[and its] banks … did not overexpand...” (no doubt due to great regulatory oversight by the\nDallas Fed!). Texas, it concludes, “offers a different model [than the rest of the states], based on\nsmall government … no state capital-gains or income tax, and a business-friendly and\nimmigrant-tolerant attitude.”3\nThe magazine is balanced; it also points out our weaknesses—primarily a lack of Tier 1\nuniversities and the potential for a repetition of California’s woes as the demography of our state\nchanges. But it makes a clear argument that Texas has the potential to be the crucible of the\nfuture of the United States.\nThis wasn’t written by the governor’s economic development office. It was written by unbiased\nparties in one of the most respected journals in the world. I suggest to this chamber that they take\nthis and every piece of propaganda we can garner and immediately put it in the hands of every\nCEO and leading academic in the country—in Michigan (where Ralph and Comerica moved\nfrom) and in California and New York and every other place that has run aground on the shoals\nof the Great Recession—and proactively go out and incent them to pull up their stakes wherever\nthey are and replant them in this great city and state. We need to strike now and press our\ncomparative advantage to secure the future prosperity of our children and their children and their\nchildren after that.\nYou ought to pursue this mission with the same kind of enthusiasm and vigor you always have in\nfulfilling your mission here in the North Dallas Chamber. What you have done with this group\n3\n\n“America’s Future,” The Economist, July 11, 2009, p. 13.\n5\n\n\fand all your other efforts for the greater Dallas area have made and continue to make a huge\ndifference.\nI consider chambers of commerce to be the Marine Corps of the economic community of any\ncity.\nYou remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines: “Some people spend an entire\nlifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don’t have that problem.”\nDallasites don’t have that problem. Texans don’t have that problem. If we can just harness the\nspirit and devotion that is in this room and spread it city- and statewide, our future will never be\nin doubt and we will, indeed, inspire the nation.\nThanks for listening. Now, in the best tradition of the Federal Reserve, I’ll do my best to avoid\nanswering your questions.\n\n6\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSanta Barbara, California\nSeptember 3, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fPost-Traumatic Slack Syndrome and the Economic Outlook\n(With Thanks to Finn Kydland, Dolly Parton and John Kenneth Galbraith)\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Professor [Peter] Rupert. I am grateful to you and especially to our mutual friend,\nFinn Kydland, for inviting me to speak at this magnificent university tonight under the auspices\nof the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance.\nIf I may, before starting my speech, I would like to say a few words about Finn. I am half\nNorwegian: My mother descends from the seafaring Andersen clan of Sandefjord, a former\nwhaling town roughly 400 kilometers east of the farmlands of Jaeren, where Finn was born. You\ncan’t have a trace of Norwegian blood and not be proud of Finn. Only 11 Norwegians have ever\nwon a Nobel Prize, and only six have done so in my lifetime. Three of those were prizes in\neconomics.\nWhich brings to mind the old saw that there are three kinds of economists—those who can count\nand those who can’t.\nFinn can count. And reason clearly. And teach, patiently and lucidly. He has been of great help\nto us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in improving our understanding of time\ninconsistency and the business cycle. And he honors us by serving on the advisory board of the\nDallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. I am most thankful to Finn for his\ncontributions to economics, to the Federal Reserve and to Norwegian pride.\nNow to the subject at hand.\nAs Professor Rupert mentioned, my wife Nancy and I are bibliophiles. We collect rare books.\nThis is an expensive hobby that began when I wrote a paper as a student at Stanford’s Graduate\nSchool of Business on the imperfect auction market for out-of-print first editions. As you might\nguess, the recent financial crisis has ratified much of what I wrote about over 30 years ago, and\nthat, as Peter mentioned, is what enabled my recent bargain-priced purchase of the original\nOxford English Dictionary and a near-mint-condition 1841 printing of Mackay’s Memoirs of\nExtraordinary Popular Delusions, a book I recommend to anybody who wants to understand the\npathology behind the recent—and any other—financial crisis.\nOur interest in books led us to serve on a committee that advises the Library of Congress. It was\nthrough the library that we were introduced to the country singer Dolly Parton. Most people\nthink of Dolly as the caricature of Marx’s—Groucho’s, not Karl’s—swarmy quip: ―She has eyes\nthat folks adore so, and a torso even more so.‖ But Ms. Parton has a prodigious brain for music\nand business—and a passion for books. She has done a great deal for education—her foundation\nnow gives out, free of charge, over 6 million books a year to pre-K children in more than 40\nstates, the District of Columbia, Canada and the United Kingdom to start them on the road to\nreading.\nWhat does this have to do with the economy? Well, in thinking about what I wanted to say\ntonight, I was reminded about an incident that occurred when Ms. Parton was given the Library\nof Congress’ Living Legend medal for her contributions to American culture. At dinner\n1\n\n\fafterward, a rather indignant woman, offended by Ms. Parton’s … topography, thought to\ndiminish her by noting how disproportionately small her feet seemed to be. Dolly’s saucy riposte\nwas a classic: ―Well, you know, sweetie, it is very hard to grow anything in the shade.‖\nTonight, I wish to speak of the difficulty of growing our economy in the shade of an abundance\nof excess capacity for the production of goods and services worldwide.\nThe Present Situation\nYou will have read in this morning’s newspapers of the minutes released yesterday of the\nFederal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting of Aug. 11–12 and the conclusions drawn at\nthat meeting regarding the status of the economy. The collective sense of our group was that the\neconomy was leveling out. We noted that conditions in financial markets were continuing to\nimprove; household spending was stabilizing but remained constrained by ongoing job losses,\nsluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; and businesses were making\nprogress in aligning inventories with still-anemic sales and were continuing to cut back on fixed\ninvestment and payrolls. The committee concluded, given both the monetary accommodation we\nhad put in place and fiscal policy, that it was reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of\neconomic growth in a context of price stability.\nThe operative words in that sentence were ―gradual‖ and ―in a context of price stability.‖ Just\nwhat are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\nIn explaining how the economy will transition from recession to recovery, we at the Dallas Fed\nhave been referring lately to ―the Johnny Mercer effect,‖ after the Hollywood lyricist who\npenned the refrain ―Ac-cent-chuate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.‖\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending\ntogether account for 3 percentage points of the 3.9-percentage-point decline in real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) that we’ve seen over the past four quarters. So, if we eliminate these\nnegatives, we go a long way toward stabilizing the economy.\nThe latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped.\nIndeed, our latest estimate is that residential investment will add roughly half of 1 percentage\npoint to GDP growth in the current quarter. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative,\nbut as long as it does not become even more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth.\nAnd if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin\nto accentuate the positive.\nConsumption, the most prominent of all GDP components, has suffered its biggest four-quarter\ndrop since 1951.1 But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust their spending levels\nquickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other\nwords, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually\noccur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring some\nnew shock. We certainly do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a\nglobal boom any time soon, but the latest data on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and\nretail sales are broadly consistent with Friedman’s theory. Real household spending rose for the\nthird month in a row in July and is up 0.6 percent (not annualized) so far this year, though some\nof this growth undoubtedly reflects the cash-for-clunkers program, which has now expired.\n\n2\n\n\fIn a similar vein, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management shows export orders\nswinging into positive territory as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to turn\naround. Again, we have a reversal of signs and the elimination of a negative: Falling exports\nsubtracted 1.9 percentage points from GDP growth over the past four quarters. Nonresidential\nfixed investment has been an even larger drag on the economy, subtracting 2.4 percentage points\nfrom GDP growth. But, as with consumption, the latest monthly indicators suggest a bottoming\nout and hint at the beginnings of a modest expansion.\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is kicking into gear, accentuating a positive:\nGovernment purchases added 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, up almost 1\npercentage point from the average of the previous three quarters.\nThe point is: A lot of former negatives are being eliminated or even turned into positives. Former\npositives, like government purchases, are being accentuated. The combination is beginning to\npropel the economy upward.\nThe question is: How robust and sustainable will the recovery be?\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth we receive\nas firms achieve control of their inventories will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and\ndemand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do\nnot want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment\nindifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment.\nThat means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such\nformerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. This reallocation will be impeded by\nfinancial markets that—while improving—continue to operate at less-than-full efficiency. I\nsurmise that the re-gearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will\nfocus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For\nconsumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and\nemployment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and a continued focus on absolute\nneeds rather than wants.\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies\nin a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting to get a read\non how they are positioning their enterprises.\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase,\nwhat to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are\nstill suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from\n―post-traumatic slack syndrome.‖\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready\nmoney and robust global demand.

I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a near-term snapback from the short,\nintense downstroke, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to\nthe elongated side of the mark.\nNow, mind you, this is what I foresee from my vantage point, standing before you tonight. Yet\nwell before I met Finn Kydland or could afford to collect rare books, or was taught economics by\nDolly Parton, I took an undergraduate course from John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith warned his\nstudents that ―[T]he only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look\nrespectable.‖ My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a\nPiscean, and I’m sticking with it.\n5\n\n\fPeter, thank you. I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions the audience might\nhave.\nNotes\n1\n\nConsumption surged after the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 because people feared a return to World\nWar II-style rationing.

Fisher\nIn his upcoming book, In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, David Wessel\nof the Wall Street Journal writes that ―Fed officials are the Jewish mothers of the global\neconomy. They always have to worry about something …‖1 He also organizes the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) into ―cool guys,‖ ―jocks,‖ ―geeks‖ and ―wannabes.‖ I am classified\nas one of the ―jocks‖ who, according to Wessel, are ―determined to show their manhood by\ntalking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.‖2 So this morning, you are going to hear\nfrom a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity.\nIf you had turned to page 2 of the Wall Street Journal on Monday, you would have seen a\nfelicitous headline that read, ―Fed‘s Lending Ebbs as Crisis Subsides.‖ The leading indicators for\nJune that were released on Monday by the Conference Board do, indeed, hint at a crisis\nsubsiding: The index rose for the third straight month and, in doing so, has registered gains\ncomparable to those seen last in the economic recoveries of 1991 and 2001–02. The index\nreflected recent increases in residential building permits, a modest increase in the manufacturing\nworkweek, a retreat in initial jobless claims and slight improvement in supplier deliveries. Taken\ntogether with other, recent economic data releases, these movements might be viewed as\nsignaling improving conditions in manufacturing and distribution. As to the Fed‘s lending, had\nyou suffered through my last few speeches, you would have heard me say that the Federal\nReserve had pulled the economy back from the abyss as I reviewed the success of the temporary\nprograms we put in place to revive the functioning of the key credit markets.3\nThe Journal is right: Our lending from these facilities has ebbed. To update you: At last count,\nour holdings of commercial paper had been reduced from $350 billion at its peak to $111 billion;\nthe primary dealer credit facility has gone untapped for 10 weeks; overseas central bank\nborrowing under the swap arrangements we put together at the end of 2007 and significantly\nexpanded afterward is running at a fifth of its peak rate. The term asset-backed securities loan\nfacility, or TALF (which some wags said was too clever by HALF), is still growing but\ncomprises a very small proportion of the Fed‘s emergency lending portfolio. And the term\nauction facility, or TAF—the very first facility we created in December of 2007 to auction\nsignificant amounts of discount window credit to primary-credit-eligible depository\ninstitutions—is running an average daily balance that is almost half the rate it reached during the\nfourth quarter of 2008.\nSo what‘s to worry about?\nWell, central bankers always find things to worry over—we are genetically programmed that\nway. Today I‘ll speak of two concerns. The first is the longer-term outlook for the economy. The\nsecond has to do with the separate but related problem of the concentration of financial power in\nthe hands of too few institutions and the pathology of too-big-to-fail.\n1\n\n\fThe Economic Outlook\nThe outlook for real activity over the next several quarters is improving. While there is\nconsiderable angst regarding the problem of growing unemployment, which in the troughs of the\nlast two recessions was a painful and politically evocative lagging indicator, there are clear signs\nthat the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in critical areas. The mathematics of\nstabilization is interesting. One of my colleagues at the Dallas Fed calls it ―the Johnny Mercer\neffect,‖ after the famous Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain ―Ac-cent-tchu-ate the\npositive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.‖\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending each\nsubtracted more than a percentage point from GDP growth, on average, during the fourth quarter\nof 2008 and first quarter of 2009 (the latest periods for which we have data). The latest monthly\nindicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped and may even be\nreversing. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become\nmore negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation\nmoderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\nAs to consumption, the most prominent of all GDP components: With the exception of the\nepisode in the spring of 1980 when President Carter imposed credit controls, consumption has\nsuffered its biggest two-quarter drop since records began in 1947. But, as Milton Friedman\ntaught us, households adjust the level of their spending quickly as the economic outlook changes,\nwithout waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job\nprospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may\nwell be over for household consumption, barring new bad news. While we do not expect\nAmerican consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, latest data on\npersonal consumption expenditures and retail sales appear consistent with Friedman‘s theory.\nIn a similar vein, the latest reports from the Institute for Supply Management show export orders\nstabilizing as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to bottom out. Again, we\nhave a reversal of signs and mitigation—if not elimination—of the negative: Falling exports\nsubtracted 3.8 percentage points from GDP growth over fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter\n2009. Nonresidential fixed investment was nearly as large a drag: 3.6 percentage points. But, as\nwith residential investment, the latest monthly indicators suggest at least a bottoming out and,\nhopefully, even the beginnings of a rebound.\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is about to kick in, turning a 0.2-percentage-point\ndrag on GDP growth into a significant plus.\nA lot of former negatives are being eliminated. We are seeing changes from negative impulses to\nslightly positive ones. This accentuates the positive in the aggregate. We probably have the\nbeginnings of a faint recovery.\nHow robust and sustainable will the recovery be? There‘s the rub—the stuff of concern.\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth from\ninventory investment will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently\ntransitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n2\n\n\fI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do\nnot want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment\nindifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment.\nThat means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such\nformerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. I surmise that this regearing will take time\nand that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and\nbalance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl\nout of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight\nbudgeting and continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been and will continue to be impeded by\nfinancial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I\nwould argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having\nnormalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that\nfinancial headwinds like these take years to abate.\nTo offset those headwinds, the fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting\nin place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so to prevent unprecedented year-over-year\ndeclines in wage and salary income from translating into falling disposable income—while\nsimultaneously trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the\nmakeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net\nexports—the ―G,‖ or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis while ―C‖ is flaccid,\n―I‖ is hesitant and net ―X‖ is tentative. At the present rate of government expenditures thus far\nthis year, federal, state and local authorities—net of intragovernmental transfers—are expected\nto spend $5.6 trillion in 2009, equivalent to 40 percent of expected GDP.\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures almost certainly come with a real longterm price tag: higher tax rates, greater collective indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest\nrates driven by the government‘s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government\nput a limit on the American people‘s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive growth in\nthe overall economy. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less\nattractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic\nstimulus while simultaneously pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government‘s debtfinance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—\nboth overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration\nwill work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. He\nwill, incidentally, have to square his corners with the Congressional Budget Office, which\nestimates that annual deficits will stay above at least $600 billion a year over the next decade and\nwill require an addition of $9.1 trillion in debt.\nErrol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in ―reconciling [his] gross habits\nwith [his] net income.‖ I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their\nlimit of tolerance of the gross ―habits‖ of government and the net new indebtedness they are\n3\n\n\fwilling to pass on to their children, all of which means to me that reliance on government\nspending as an antidote to what ails the economy is a thin reed to rest on. Given the expected\nslow adjustment rate of the other variables that make for sustainable economic growth, my guess\nis it will be a long time until we reach a point when that growth will carry on at rates to which we\nhad become accustomed. I envision an economic path forward from here that looks something\nlike a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a snap back as the negative\nmomentum of the short, intense down stroke of the check mark abates and turns upward but then\nsettles into a lower growth slope on the elongated side of the mark.\nMind you, one of my professors at Harvard was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned us that\n―economic forecasting was created to make astrology look respectable.‖ I might be totally wrong\nhere. But that is how I see it presently from my perch at the Dallas Fed: Economic growth is\nlikely to be slower in the out years than we have become accustomed to.\nThe challenge for the Federal Reserve is to provide needed near-term monetary stimulus while\nmaintaining a credible commitment to long-term price stability. This means (a) distinctly\navoiding any perception that we are willing to monetize this or any other administration‘s fiscal\ninitiatives, and (b) providing the marketplace with a clear sense of how we will unwind in a\ntimely manner the stop-gap measures that have resulted in a dramatic expansion of our balance\nsheet.\nI want to return to the chart on page 2 of Monday‘s Wall Street Journal. While the temporary\nliquidity programs I mentioned earlier have retracted, our balance sheet has expanded due to the\nincrease in our holdings of securities held outright. Here are the numbers for the past year\nthrough last week: The Fed has taken onto its consolidated balance sheet $205 billion in\nTreasury securities, $102 billion in the debt of Federal agencies and $526 billion in mortgagebacked securities. We presently carry a total of $1.3 trillion in securities held outright,\naccounting for roughly 63 percent of our total assets.4 When the Fed acquires securities, the\nfunds enter the banking system and ultimately appear in the reserve accounts held at the Fed by\nbanks and other financial institutions. When these reserves are removed from our balance sheet\nand lent out to the public, expansion in the money supply and easier credit conditions could\nultimately result in inflationary pressures. Mindful of this, concerned parties have asked what our\n―exit strategy‖ will be.\nChairman Bernanke provided what I thought was a fulsome exposition of our exit arsenal in his\nsemiannual Humphrey–Hawkins testimony (the CliffsNotes version of his presentation was\nmade available in an op-ed in the Journal on Tuesday).5 He detailed the means by which the\nFOMC can either directly reduce the stock of reserves or temper the incentive for banks to\ndeploy them into the economy by making it attractive for banks to keep them on deposit at the\nFed through higher interest rate payments. We could also drain reserves and excess liquidity by\narranging large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), have the Treasury sell bills\nto the public to sop up money in the system and place the proceeds on deposit at the Fed and, if\nnecessary, sell outright into the market some of the longer-term securities we hold on the left\nside of our balance sheet.\nI will say no more about this here today; I think the chairman has covered the waterfront on this\nsubject. But I will acknowledge that, yes, to pull the credit markets out of a death spiral, we have\ntaken great risk with the Federal Reserve balance sheet. We never contemplated doing more than\n4\n\n\fthe minimum necessary. And we know that we can do too much. For example, while one can\nargue that by agreeing to purchase up to $300 billion in long-term U.S. Treasuries, the FOMC\nprovided a needed short-term tonic to private credit markets, we dare not come to be viewed as a\nhandmaiden to the Treasury. By loosening the anchor we have established for long-term inflation\nexpectations, we could create the perception that monetary policy is subject to political\nimperatives, doing lasting damage to our ability to maintain price stability and restore full\nemployment. I believe we have come as close as we dare to the line between acceptable and\nunacceptable risk in this regard, and do not personally wish for us to expand or extend our\npurchases of Treasuries beyond the cumulative $300 billion planned by this fall.\nTo conclude this little diversion on exit strategy, let me say that I am aware some will argue that\nlaying out our arsenal is not enough; we need to convince markets we have the nerve to deploy it\nin a timely fashion. Within minutes of the conclusion of the chairman‘s testimony, one\ncommentator sent out a client note, later echoed by many others on op-ed pages and on the web,\nas follows: We now ―know the Fed has the bullets, but fear it will not have the guts to pull the\ntrigger.‖ To a Texan who lives in a gun culture, this is a cute analogy (especially coming from\nsomeone who‘s Swiss!). But I would not doubt our resolve. We know full well that monetary\npolicy trickles in with a lag and that we will have to ―pull the trigger‖ of tightening policy well\nbefore it is politically convenient.\nToo Big to Fail\nFiscal and monetary authorities today face the additional, special challenge of reforming\nfinancial regulation so as to minimize the chances of a future meltdown. Here, again, there is a\ntension between the short term and the long term. In the short term, once a financial crisis has\nbegun to develop, the natural focus is on limiting the damage—on preventing contagion. A real\ndanger is that in the longer term, the prospect of these government damage-control efforts will\nlead financial institutions to take inappropriate risks, making the financial sector even more\ndysfunctional.\nThe financial crisis has had some important consequences for the structure of the banking\nindustry—indeed, the financial industry as a whole. We saw the investment banking model\nlargely disappear as some of the major players—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—\nconverted to bank holding companies, while some others—Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and\nLehman Brothers—are no longer with us. The restructurings that have taken place have certainly\naltered the shape of the U.S. banking industry.\nA major concern of mine is that all the crisis-related acquisitions we have seen may further\nconsolidate financial assets and power into the hands of a few large organizations, leading\nultimately to reduced competition and a less diverse and efficient financial sector. The massive\ngovernment assistance recently provided to large banks may be artificially tilting the competitive\nbalance in favor of large institutions.\nFor example, each of the four largest commercial banking organizations, and others as well, was\nprovided with substantial government assistance during the crisis—all, at least implicitly, in the\nname of the too-big-to-fail doctrine. As a group, the total asset base of the four has grown 30\npercent since June 2007.6 In contrast, industry assets outside the four have grown a smaller 12\npercent.\n5\n\n\fThat growth reflects acquisitions. Bank of America‘s assets grew 51 percent from June 2007 to\nMarch 2009, assisted in no small part by its acquisitions of Countrywide Financial and Merrill.\nWells Fargo‘s asset base grew 138 percent, thanks mainly to its acquisition of Wachovia. J.P.\nMorgan Chase acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and grew 43 percent.\nThe only institution among the top four that did not grow is Citigroup, whose assets declined\nalmost 20 percent. And here‘s an interesting observation: Rough estimates suggest the top four\ninstitutions together would have shrunk—not just Citigroup—if not for the acquisitions just\nmentioned. Taking out the acquired assets, the current top four likely would have shrunk 7\npercent as a group over the period in question.\nThe acquisitions of troubled banks have worked to perpetuate size concentration in the banking\nindustry. The top four currently control 44 percent of industry assets. If we simply take away\nfrom the top four the assets they recently acquired, they would have ―only‖ 30 percent of the\nindustry‘s asset base.\nIn using acquisitions to resolve the crisis, we may have unwittingly perpetuated one of its root\ncauses—the too-big-to-fail doctrine.\nThoughtful critics will point out that too-big-to-fail is economically perverse: There is something\ninherently anticapitalistic when you have a system that allows banks, their shareholders and\ncreditors to profit when things go well but leaves the taxpayer holding the bag when things turn\nsour.\nThe economist Allan Meltzer likes to say that ―capitalism without failure is like religion without\nsin: It doesn‘t work.‖ In order to have a financial system that remains the fountainhead of credit\nand the wherewithal for business men and women to bring forth new ideas and products and\ncreate employment, we must have a dynamic system that rewards winners rather than coddles\nlosers, that incentivizes prudent behavior and harshly penalizes imprudent behavior.\nMy colleague Gary Stern—the outgoing president of the Minneapolis Fed who literally wrote the\nbook on TBTF (too big to fail)—recently gave a speech that pulled no punches on this front. He\nsaid (a) ―it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been\nat the largest institutions operating in the country,‖ (b) the problem of too-big-to-fail was ―not …\naddressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991 [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act]‖ and (c) ―creditors of such [large] complex financial institutions expected, on\nthe basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers‘\nmotivations, protection if failure threatened.‖7 Thus incentivized, management of these\ninstitutions took excessive risk, and the market underpriced that risk. And it follows in President\nStern‘s mind, as it does in mine, that unless incentives are focused upon in seeking to cure the\nproblem of TBTF, we will not only fail to address this most troublesome pathology but may\nmake it worse.\nStern argues that the Treasury proposal now on the table to correct the problem ―fails‖ in regard\nto corralling incentives for managers of large institutions to repeat the errors for which the public\nhas recently paid so dearly. Here is his punch line: ―I would describe the Treasury plan … as\n‗status quo plus‘—[with] more capital, more liquidity, better supervision, [and] far-reaching\nresolution authority for the largest institutions. [But] [t]here is little reason to think that these\n6\n\n\fsteps will … succeed in reining in TBTF effectively over time because they do not change the\nincentives which create the problem. In fact,‘‘ Stern concludes, ―there is nothing in the Treasury\nproposal designed to put creditors of large, systemically important financial institutions at risk of\nloss. … [T]he Treasury proposal … leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable\n…‖8\nAs we grapple with TBTF and with the overall regulatory treatment of so-called Tier 1\ninstitutions, we are going to have to bear Gary Stern‘s criticism in mind. The only way to ensure\na robust financial system is to enforce a system that marries risk-taking to consequences and see\nto it that the consequences for mismanagement are loss of managerial positions and the capital of\nshareholders and creditors, including uninsured depositors, rather than a second chance that only\nfurther concentrates financial power.\nThis is important—not only to ensure a more efficient economic system but to better facilitate\nthe implementation of monetary policy. The extent and duration of the extraordinary steps taken\nby those of us at the Fed are complicated by the prolonged existence of financial institutions that\nfall into this troublesome category.\nBanks that are too big to fail exacerbate business and credit cycles. In the good times, these\ninstitutions use excessive leverage and their cost-of-funds advantage to grow more rapidly than\nsmaller banks. Expansionary monetary policy is then given a boost as these institutions grow at\neye-popping rates.\nBut what happens when financial conditions worsen? Too-big-to-fail banks must de-lever,\nshrinking their asset books and, in general, swimming against the tide of easier monetary policy.\nAs the weak capital position of these institutions becomes widely recognized, they find it\ndifficult and costly to raise funds. A weakened financial system with several of these banks will\ninduce a flight to quality, increasing credit spreads and interest rates at a time when the Fed is\nattempting to do just the opposite. This slows economic growth, reducing asset values and\noverall wealth as credit availability deteriorates further. An adverse-feedback loop is created,\nworking in direct opposition to the policy efforts of the central bank.\nThe existence of financial institutions that are too big to fail dramatically impacts the\ntransmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The blockages they create—in credit markets and\non balance sheets throughout the economy—compound our travails by making it more difficult\nto get the timing and dosage of monetary policy ―right.‖ They reduce the effectiveness of our\ntraditional tools, introducing a need for special liquidity and credit facilities that are difficult to\nunwind.\nI know my opinions on this subject will hardly endear me to the largest financial institutions. On\nhis death bed, Voltaire (who was neither a Hollywood lyricist nor a movie actor nor the president\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis) was asked to renounce the devil. He is said to have\nreplied that this was no time for making new enemies. Some think that during this time of crisis\nand with financial and economic recovery still so tenuous, it is not the right time to think about\nproposals that make the perfect the enemy of the good. I disagree. I believe we need to ―think\nlong,‖ as the Californian George Shultz likes to say, and the current policy prescription for\ntreatment of TBTF is a bit shortsighted or, at best, necessary but not sufficient. If we want to\navoid a repeat of what has just happened over the past 18 months, we need to exorcise the notion\n7\n\n\fthat an institution is too big to fail and remove all incentives for any institution to risk infecting\nthe health of the financial system. If we make some enemies in the process, so be it. The object is\nto get it right.\nThank you. I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\nNotes\n1\n\nIn Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic,” by David Wessel, New York: Crown Business, 2009,\np. 130.\n2\nSee note 1, p. 124.\n3\n―Back from the Abyss: Now What?‖ May 15, 2009, and ―Remarks Before the Washington Association of Money\nManagers,‖ May 28, 2009.\n4\nFederal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1, July 16, 2009.\n5\n―The Fed‘s Exit Strategy,‖ by Ben Bernanke, Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2009, p.

He is one of our country‟s most\neloquent preachers, and I am honored that he is here.\nWith such a distinguished man of the cloth present among this group of people dedicated to the\npursuit of mammon, I thought I would give a little sermon-ette this evening.\nHere are four quotes from financial scripture:\nThe first is from Charles Mackay‟s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, written in\n1841:\n“Every age has its peculiar folly—some scheme, project or\nphantasy [sic] into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love\nof gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of\nimitation.”\n“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they\ngo mad in herds....”\nThe second is taken from the father of central banking—Walter Bagehot—from his essay\n“Edward Gibbon,” in the 1856 edition of National Review:\n“[A]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money….\nAt intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large\nand craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is [a]\n„plethora‟; it finds some one, and there is „speculation‟; it is\ndevoured, and there is „panic.‟”\n1\n\n\fFrom Liaquat Ahamed, who has written a superbly entertaining book, published\nearlier this year, titled Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World:\n“I maintain that the Great Depression was not some act of God or\nthe result of some deep-rooted contradictions of capitalism but the\ndirect result of a series of misjudgments by economic\npolicymakers.…”\nFinally, Paul Volcker as quoted in Bill Neikirk‟s Volcker: Portrait of the Money Man in 1987:\n“The Federal Reserve has no way of offsetting the financial market\npressure associated with excessive deficits.… Pushing more money\ninto the system to finance the Treasury would only serve to\nheighten fears about inflation and the future course of interest\nrates.”\nTonight, I will reference each of those passages as we explore where we have been, where we\nare today and the fiscal predicament that awaits us further down the road. But first, some context.\nReverend Harkins will no doubt have heard the story of the humble Presbyterian pastor who\nvisited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. This generous\npastor took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store\nfor a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The pastor then dropped the man back at the\nshelter, handed him $20 and told him, “Son, you have been saved. My church is just one block\naway from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the pastor went to the\nshelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed,\nreading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to my church this morning to give\ntestimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the pastor.\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my\nwhiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this\nnew suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So\nI used the $20 to take a cab to the Episcopal church.”\nI certainly don‟t need to tell a room full of Washington money managers what got the nation into\nits current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly\nheaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on\nthe road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at\nleast two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial\nreorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new\ncapacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the\nglobal economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and\n2\n\n\fcommunication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating\nglobalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The\nworld was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new\nsources of funds as well as new places to invest.\nEasy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for\ntoo long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing\nreturns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—“craved”\nand “devoured” new risk instruments, to paraphrase Bagehot. As a result, they came up with new\n“schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and\nfinancial innovation.\nShort-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and\nlender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to\npackage and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, “living within your means” became a less\ncompelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial\ngain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to\nmathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay\nand Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles\nthrough history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat\n“speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the\nlove of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational\nexuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could\nstomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into\nrecession.\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know\nthe answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the\nLittle Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds,\nthe Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells 1 and the rest of the undeserving\ngroup, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives\nof men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman\nBrothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis or John Thain for “Sunshine Charlie”\nMitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have captured the liturgy\nof invective heard from Father Coughlin‟s contemporary secular cousins. Nothing is new under\nthe sun; old prejudices and conspiracy theories never die.2 On airwaves and in the blogosphere,\non editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics are casting\nabout for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of men” and women from Bethesda to\n\n1\n\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell was the head of National City Bank, the forerunner to Citigroup.\nFor instance, in a current best-selling book in China, Currency Wars, it is asserted that the major central banks—\nincluding the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England—are controlled by a small group of private bankers. These\nbankers make their profits through the control of the nation‟s money supply.\n2\n\n3\n\n\fBeijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic\ncollapse.\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal\nReserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke,\nmy colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend\nthe system.\nI believe that the initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the\nchasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total\nbreakdown of the financial system. Having announced our extension of term lending to banks in\nDecember, in rapid order, we then set in motion a series of steps to provide liquidity, strengthen\nthe security of certain banks, become the equivalent of market maker for key financial\ninstruments such as commercial paper and certain asset-backed securities and, in ways\nappropriate to the times, deliver on our mandate as lender of last resort.\nYou are all familiar with the efforts taken by the Federal Reserve to these ends. I won‟t review\nthem program by program this evening. I think it fair to say that with these actions the Federal\nReserve has done everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the\n“misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I\nshould add parenthetically, that everyone and their brother feel Japan made in the 1990s).\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the\neconomy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots”\nbeginning to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery.\nThis is not to be Pollyannaish or imply that these sprouts are spreading like kudzu. But the\nknock-on effect of the Fed‟s direct efforts does seem to have reignited animal spirits in markets\nthat had been frozen. The commercial paper market has been revived. Mortgage rates have\ndeclined significantly. Issuance of corporate bonds has become robust. The premium over\nTreasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has fallen by\nmore than 35 percent since peaking last December. The same can be said of higher risk bonds as\nwell as jumbo mortgages—all markets considered to be at the far end of the risk spectrum. This\nround-trip back from last fall‟s unprecedented flight to quality is also reflected in the stock\nmarket, as equity markets have coursed upward and volatility has diminished.\nWhile it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad\neconomy, I am pleased to see a reaction on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that\npurchasing managers see an abatement in the pace of decline in new orders; manufacturers\nsurveyed by the Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas Feds, to varying degrees,\nreport a moderation in their previous rates of decline in activity; 3 retail sales are no longer\nplunging; and, as all of you heard from the Conference Board on Tuesday, consumers‟\nassessment of the economy over the next six months—driven primarily by slowing job losses—\nappears to be less pessimistic.\n\n3\n\nTexas produces more than 8 percent of the total manufactured goods in the United States, ranking second behind\nCalifornia in factory production.\n4\n\n\fThese are encouraging signs. But, to be sure, we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go\nbefore we sleep.\nCompared with the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter results for the nation‟s largest banks\nare encouraging, yet obvious challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—\nthe creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains\nelusive. Consumers at home remain cautious, for fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The\nmarkets we sell into abroad—Mexico and Europe, for example—remain strikingly weak, while\nothers such as China are perhaps more robust but are insufficiently sized to fill the hole left by\nconsumers at home and in our larger export markets.4\nUnder these conditions, I have been forecasting a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor\neven a U-shaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix\nbetween consumption, savings and investment. It is worth recalling that employment did not\nreach its nadir until 21 months after the end of the 2001 recession, though headwinds then were\nnot nearly as severe as those we face today.\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after\nupcoming revisions, I venture we will find we contracted at somewhere between an annualized 5\nand 6 percent. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we are likely to\nbounce along the bottom for a while. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained\ngrowth gets under way before the end of the year. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while\nmitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers), will likely\ntake us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely\nto remain excessive for some time to come.\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack\nworldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to\nthe deflationary side. As evidenced in the Dallas Fed‟s most recent manufacturing survey, firms\nreceiving lower prices for their goods outnumbered those receiving higher prices 11-to-1,\nalthough firms do expect deflationary pressures to begin subsiding.5\nNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort the decisionmaking of\nhouseholds as well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to\nknow the outlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and\nglobal slack: It is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity\nutilization tighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—who, in keeping with the\ntheme of this evening, I suppose I could safely refer to as the Moses of monetary policy—\nreminds us that inflation, defined as “a steady and sustained rise in prices,” is “always and\neverywhere a monetary phenomenon.”6 Bearing this in mind, we must be careful with the\ndeployment of our monetary initiatives.\n4\n\nThrough April, China‟s overall imports from the rest of the world dropped 23 percent from last year‟s level to\n$78.8 billion. The U.S. is presently exporting $5.6 billion a month in goods to China.\n5\n“Texas Manufacturing Remains Weak But Outlook Continues to Improve,” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, press\nrelease, May 26, 2009.\n6\nThe quotes are taken from Milton Friedman‟s “Inflation: Causes and Consequences” in his book Dollars and\nDeficits, published by Friedman in 1968. Friedman clearly recognized that any of a wide variety of shocks can give\n5\n\n\fAs the nation‟s central bank, the Fed performs two major roles, in addition to its regulatory\nduties. One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest\nrates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable\nemployment.\nThe Fed‟s other role is, as mentioned, to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial\nmarkets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and\ndysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire\ncircumstances. Reflecting the larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal\nReserve has extended its lender of last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the\nFederal Reserve has been aggressive in putting programs in place to revive the functioning of\nkey credit markets and pull the economy away from the brink. I point to the term auction (TAF)\nand commercial paper (CPFF) facilities as examples of initiatives that have worked as planned\nby the FOMC and are now shrinking in size. These actions are not permanent injections of\nmoney that may later fuel inflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize\nmalfunctioning markets. As such, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable\ngrowth and price stability.\nCongress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good\nnews is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it\nshould propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of\neconomic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time\npasses.\nUnfortunately, that momentum faces a real, long-term threat: storm clouds on the horizon in the\nform of daunting fiscal imbalances.\nThat deficits will be high over the next few years seems clear, with a $1.8 trillion deficit\nexpected this year and $3.8 trillion in new debt issuance now forecast over the next five years.\nPerhaps more important, annual deficits exceeding half a trillion dollars are projected for at least\n10 years into the future, emphasizing that we as a nation will continue to spend considerably\nmore than we take in long after the current economic crisis.\nThe country‟s major newspapers recently reported with great urgency the administration‟s\nfinding that Social Security would begin spending more than it takes in by 2016—seven short\nyears from now. Left unreported was the fact that the discounted present value of entitlement\ndebt, over the infinite horizon, reached $104 trillion.7 This is almost eight times the annual gross\nrise to short-term changes in the price level. Too often, those who quote his inflation dictum fail to distinguish\nbetween temporary and sustained price movements.\n7\nEstimates for Social Security are compiled from the official 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the\nFederal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds. The $15.1 trillion figure\npresented here is the amount by which promised benefits exceed expected revenues, primarily from payroll taxes,\nover the infinite horizon using a long-run discount rate of 2.9 percent.\nEstimates for Medicare are compiled from the official 2009 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal\nHospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds. The $88.9 trillion cumulative\nfigure presented here is the amount by which promised benefits for Medicare Parts A, B and D exceed expected\nrevenues over the infinite horizon using a long-run discount rate of 2.9 percent.\n6\n\n\fdomestic product of the United States—and almost 20 times the size of the debt our government\nis expected to accumulate between 2009 and 2014.\nMost of this entitlement shortfall comes from Medicare rather than Social Security. As you may\nknow, Medicare has three main components: Part A for hospital stays, Part B for doctor visits\nand Part D for prescription drugs. The fiscal shortfall for Part A alone is $36.4 trillion—about\none third of all entitlement debt. Part B‟s shortfall is just a tad larger, clocking in at $37 trillion.\nPart D—the latest addition to the Medicare program—registers a shortfall of $15.5 trillion. And\nSocial Security, the program about which various reforms have been so frequently mooted in\nrecent years, registers a deficit of $15.1 trillion—only one seventh of the total unfunded liability\nfrom entitlement programs.\nThis is the fiscal predicament to which I alluded earlier—a looming budgetary threat to our longterm economic prosperity. And while the announcement that the Social Security trust fund will\nbegin its decline one year earlier is an important fiscal event, the swelling of overall entitlement\ndebt to more than one hundred trillion dollars has far more serious implications for economic\ngrowth—implications we are poorly positioned to address given the budget deficits we face\ntoday.\nOur successor generations are coming to grips with this daunting reality. Faced with the prospect\nof a government that they believe may be unable to deliver on its promise of long-term fiscal\nbalance—particularly with regard to entitlement programs—these individuals might logically\nbegin to alter their consumption patterns, spending less today to save more for tomorrow. There\nis nothing wrong with increasing savings. But, in an economy driven by consumption, this\nintertemporal hedging may dampen the pace of future economic growth.\nOf course, any student of history knows that throughout time, governments unwilling to face the\nmusic and fund their liabilities have turned to monetary authorities to print their way out of their\npredicament. We all know by heart the pathologies that afflicted Weimar Germany, Argentina\nand other countries. And we have daily reminders from bond vigilantes like Bill Gross about the\nprospect of losing our AAA rating. This cannot be allowed to happen in America. Which is why\nI am pleased to see that the new administration has embraced what was hitherto perceived as the\nthird rail of American politics and brought the issue of unfunded entitlement liabilities to the\nfore. For the sake of our grandchildren, I hope that the administration and the Congress will take\nthis vexing beast of a problem by the horns and tame it.\n\nNeither estimate incorporates the value of program trust funds, currently estimated at $2.4 trillion for Social Security\nand $0.3 trillion for Medicare. Because spending down these trust funds will require the use of general revenue,\nsome budget analysts include them when calculating unfunded liabilities. If this is done, then the total figure would\nrise from $104 trillion to $106.7 trillion.\nThese figures also do not include current or projected future nonentitlement debt, including the $10.7 trillion\nnational debt as of the end of 2008, the $1.8 trillion deficit for this year, the $3.8 trillion in projected debt between\n2010 and 2014, and any future debt that might be compiled after 2014. If projected debt between now and 2014\nwere added, and no further nonentitlement debt were accumulated in the future, then the total figure would rise from\n$106.7 trillion to $123.0 trillion.\n\n7\n\n\fAgainst that background, it is important that monetary policymakers be especially sensitive to\nconcerns voiced about the dramatic expansion of the Fed‟s balance sheet in an era of high\ndeficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the\nmiscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without\nheightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations\nin mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of\ncredit markets and the economy—not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our\nbalance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a\nfew eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase\nif necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while\nit is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee‟s (FOMC) decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S.\nTreasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in private credit markets—has been viewed by\nsome as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can\nalso tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any\nlonger and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit\nmarkets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak,\nwe are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way.\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the\nTreasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue\njust over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book\nof Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as\nmonetizing debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian\nagainst, future inflation and drive real interest rates higher.\nYou may wish to note that, press and analysts‟ reports to the contrary, a keen student of the H.4.1\nand the Foreign and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) custody holdings reports of the\nFed will detect that foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agencies have been growing\nat a robust pace, not shrinking. And from what I can detect from the activity of so-called indirect\nbidders in Treasury auctions—indirect bidders submit competitive bids through others rather\nthan directly; central banks are among those who commonly bid indirectly—there continues to\nbe strong demand for longer duration Treasuries—again, contrary to rumors and press reports.\nThus, to date, our actions have not given rise to concern that we will violate Paul‟s Dictum.\nThis is important, for there are concerns in some quarters that the Federal Reserve will be\npoliticized. For example, there have been suggestions that Congress should be involved in the\nselection of Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who, unlike the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, are not appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate. I trust that Congress\nwill resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the\ninterests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist\nthe urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\n8\n\n\fYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the\nFOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I\nthink we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the timetested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous,\nalways bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound,\nmission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me speak to you\ntonight. I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMay 22, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCommencement Address\nRichard W. Fisher\nI have enjoyed a rich history with this great school. St. Mark’s educated my two sons, Anders\nand James. My wife, Nancy, served on its board of trustees. Many of my closest and most\nrespected friends proudly claim this fine institution as their alma mater. And I was delighted to\nhear this morning that William Hicks was this year’s winner of the Richard and Nancy Fisher\nCommunity Service Award. I know and love St. Mark’s. It is an honor to have been chosen to be\nyour commencement speaker.\nIt is a special honor to be introduced by Arnie Holtberg, a great headmaster. The best definition\nof a leader that I know is summarized in John Paul Jones’ creed. The “Father of the Navy”\ndefined the perfect officer as a man “of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy,\nand the nicest sense of personal honor.” That describes your headmaster to a “T.” Mr. Holtberg,\nthank you for your leadership of this magnificent school.\nBefore I begin, I want the Class of 2009 to stand up. Look around this courtyard. All of these\npeople have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents, cousins,\nuncles and aunts, your brothers and sisters, your friends, your teachers and coaches and\ncounselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They\nhave encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and\nhectored you and driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy hearts to\ncelebrate your admission to the society of educated men. Give them a round of applause. Thank\nthem for loving you.\nNow, please be seated.\nThe only thing that now stands between you and the reception of your diploma is … me. So I\nwill make it snappy.\nBy now, you have taken enough English and writing courses to know the definition of a good\nessay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own. Most graduation\nspeeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is to dig through\nBartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find something said by some sage that will\ngrace a graduation ceremony with a lesson you can take with you as you go off into this\nmysterious and challenging world.\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement this evening, I poured over\nthe sayings of the great minds of the ages: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammed, St. Augustine,\nVoltaire, Martin Luther … Manny Ramirez, Miley Cyrus.\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but as Marksmen, you already\nknow them: be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; don’t waste your talents;\nquestion authority (but not the headmaster); take risks; push the envelope; be true to yourself, to\nyour school, to your country; never promise more than you can deliver; never compromise your\nintegrity; never forget that you have been given talent to do good; never, never, never, never give\n1\n\n\fup the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all good words. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation\nceremony if its organizers would forgo the speaker and simply remind the graduating class to\noccasionally read or listen to the books-on-tape versions of the Bible or the Koran or\nShakespeare or Confucius—the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever\nread or listened to.\nHow could I, a lowly central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and\nmonetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily. So I\ndug deep into my memory banks and called upon a source more erudite than Shakespeare and\nmore insightful than Confucius … my mother.\nMy mother was a stoic Norwegian. She was born and raised in an outpost in South Africa, lost\nher father when she was 4 in the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit\nof the type of education you have received at St. Mark’s. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a\nkind of female Nordic Yogi Berra: She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her three boys.\nOne is especially germane for this evening. She would say: “Never let your brains go to your\nhead.” The pun is horrific but the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to keep\nyour superb education and your talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of talent are necessary\nbut insufficient for success in life.\nTime and again, in business and research labs and universities and government, we see instances\nwhere men and women of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the\njaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with\nthe same devotion they applied to developing their intellectual quotient. My heartfelt advice to\nyou is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ. You all have\ngreat futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast and enjoy it more if you remember that\na sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, wellrounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole person is as important\nan achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and\nwomen” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence. Again, remember the creed of John\nPaul Jones. Being possessed of refined manners, punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of\npersonal honor are just as important to the success of a leader as a great education.\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for a commencement oration: a smattering of Latin. You\ndon’t sound serious at a commencement unless you show off your command of an ancient\ntongue. A serious speaker might conclude with labor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor\nconquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you can’t rest on your laurels or your good family\nname or a St. Mark’s education or luck. You have to work hard to succeed. And to do so you\nhave to remember mens sana en corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is a festive night! So I will conclude with “Bubbus, sed\npossum explicare; non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\n2\n\n\fThis evening I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2009 that success comes to those\nwho best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to\nan equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly\nstrive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to\nyou ad nauseam. But you must come to understand it on your own.\nAnd if you do—if you continue through life remembering that the “whole boy is the best boy”—\nmy guess is that someday you will be standing on the stage at St. Mark’s giving a\ncommencement speech to some future generation of lucky graduates of this great school. And\nhaving the greatest pleasure a man can have: quoting your mom.\nGod bless you and good luck.\n\n3\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\nMay 15, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fBack from the Abyss: Now What?\nRichard W. Fisher\n“Every age has its peculiar folly—some scheme, project or\nphantasy [sic] into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love\nof gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of\nimitation.”\n“Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they\ngo mad in herds....”\nCharles Mackay\nMemoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions (1841)\n\n“[a]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money….\nAt intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large\nand craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is (a)\n„plethora‟; it finds some one, and there is „speculation‟; it is\ndevoured, and there is „panic.‟”\nWalter Bagehot\n“Edward Gibbon,” National Review (1856)\n\n“I maintain that the Great Depression was not some act of God or\nthe result of some deep-rooted contradictions of capitalism but the\ndirect result of a series of misjudgments by economic\npolicymakers.…”\nLiaquat Ahamed\nLords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World (2009)\n\n“The Federal Reserve has no way of offsetting the financial market\npressure associated with excessive deficits.… Pushing more money\ninto the system to finance the Treasury would only serve to\nheighten fears about inflation and the future course of interest\nrates.”\nPaul Volcker (1982)\nas quoted in William R. Neikirk‟s\nVolcker: Portrait of the Money Man (1987)\n\n1\n\n\fI have just read to you four passages from financial scripture. In this morning‟s sermon, I plan to\nmake reference to each of those passages as we explore where we have been and where we might\nbe headed.\nBut first, I want to thank the Texas Bankers Association for having me here this morning and\nVictor Pierson, the honorable mayor of Jamaica Beach and president of Moody National Bank,\nfor that kind introduction. Besides being pivotal in the organization of the TBA some 125 years\nago, the Moody family has played a rich role in the life of Texas since well before that time (a\nfulsome history I heard often—always accompanied with a wry sense of humor—from old Dan\nOppenheimer back in the 1980s). The lineal and business and banking descendents of Col.\nWilliam L. Moody have navigated hurricanes, wars, depressions and banking crises—all of epic\nproportions—and have always remained standing. They are a monument to Texas resilience. It is\nan honor to be introduced by anybody associated with the Moody legacy.\nNow to the sermon.\nI once managed Dan Oppenheimer‟s personal portfolio. One afternoon in 1982, I was visiting\nDan at the Oppenheimer Bank here in San Antonio. A Baptist preacher came in to ask him for a\n“loan.”1 He wanted to buy some cattle. Dan was teasing him about the prosperity he had\nachieved while preaching from the pulpit and warned him not to count on its permanence. “Your\ncongregation might become as prominent as you,” he said, “and then migrate to a nicer church.”\nTo illustrate the point, he invented a story about a Baptist preacher who visited a shelter where\nhe found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. The generous preacher took pity upon the\nman. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a\ntie and a new suit. The preacher then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and\ntold him, “Son, you have been saved. The Baptist church is just one block away from here. I\nwant you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the preacher went to the\nshelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed,\nreading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to the Baptist church this morning to give\ntestimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the preacher.\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my\nwhiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this\nnew suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So\nI spent the $20 and took a cab to the Episcopal church.”\nI certainly don‟t need to tell a room full of Texas bankers what got the nation into its current\neconomic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and\nthe short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to\nsalvation, but to economic perdition.\n1\n\nOppenheimer Bank was the largest of the then five surviving private unregulated banks in Texas. Typically, a loan\nfrom Oppenheimer consisted of writing a check and asking Dan to cover it with some rate of interest charged. Loans\nwere, in essence, overdrafts. Oppenheimer knew every virtue and vice of his clientele; the bank was privately owned\nand as principal, Dan viewed loans as essentially lending his own money. The bank reportedly never lost a dime. It\nclosed one year after Dan‟s death in 1987.\n2\n\n\fAllow me to address each of these individually.\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at\nleast two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial\nreorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new\ncapacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the\nglobal economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and\ncommunication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating\nglobalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The\nworld was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new\nsources of funds as well as new places to invest.\nThe easy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low\nfor too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on\nenhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free\nrates—“craved” and “devoured” new risk instruments. As a result, they came up with new\n“schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and\nfinancial innovation.\nThe short-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker\nand lender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to\npackage and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, living within your means became a less\ncompelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial\ngain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to\nmathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay\nand Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles\nthrough history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat\n“speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the\nlove of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational\nexuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could\nstomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into\nrecession.\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know\nthe answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the\nLittle Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds,\nthe Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells 2 and the rest of the undeserving\ngroup, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives\nof men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman\nBrothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis, Sandy Weill or John Thain for\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have\ncaptured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin‟s contemporary secular cousins. On\n2\n\n“Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell was the head of National City Bank, the forerunner to Citigroup.\n3\n\n\fairwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign\nparliaments, critics have been casting about for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of\nmen” and women from Bastrop to Beijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very\nedge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal\nReserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke,\nmy colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend\nthe system.\nI believe that the initiatives taken by my fellow “banksters” at the Federal Reserve prevented us\nfrom falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we\nconfronted a total breakdown of the financial system. In rapid order, we undertook a series of\nsteps. We:\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by\nstudent loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business\nAdministration, a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly\nto other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities between\nMarch and September to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the fed funds\nrate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process I supported once it became clear that\nthe immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge\nbanks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve did everything in its power to avoid making the modern\nequivalent of the “misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in\n4\n\n\fthe 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their sister feel Japan made in the\n1990s).\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the\neconomy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots” that\nhave begun to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery.\nIn the world of finance, interest rates in key areas such as mortgages and the London interbank\nmarket have declined dramatically, enlivening the housing markets and reviving interbank\nlending; private bond market issuance has resumed and, indeed as you will see in this week and\nnext week‟s issuance calendar, at robust levels for both high-grade and junk issuers; and the\nstock market has rallied from its lows, bringing with it a surge in the volume of new stock\nissuance. While it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the\nbroad economy, I am happy to see that some green shoots are also starting to emerge on Main\nStreet: The most recent reports indicate that job losses may be slowing; trucking companies—a\ngroup often looked to as a leading indicator—report a slight pickup in sales; purchasing\nmanagers are reporting that the pace of decline in new orders has abated; and retail sales are\ngetting slightly less worse.\nThese are encouraging signs. But we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we\nsleep.\nFirst quarter results for the nation‟s largest banks are encouraging, but challenges remain.\nConfidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and\nprosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive. Consumers at home remain cautious,\nfor fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The markets we sell into abroad—Mexico and\nEurope, for example—remain weak, while others such as China are perhaps more robust but are\ninsufficiently sized to fill the hole left by consumers at home and in our larger export markets. 3\nUnder these conditions, I envision a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor even a Ushaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between\nconsumption and savings and investment.\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after\nupcoming revisions, I venture we‟ll find we contracted at somewhere between 5 and 6 percent at\nan annual rate. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we‟re likely to\nbounce along the bottom for a while, perhaps punching through to positive growth as 2010\ndawns. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way any\nearlier. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government\n(particularly the need for census takers) will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we\nreverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack\nworldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to\nthe deflationary side, though we seem to have beaten that back.\n\n3\n\nThrough April, China‟s overall imports from the rest of the world dropped 23 percent from last year‟s level to\n$78.8 billion. The U.S. is presently exporting $5.6 billion a month in goods to China.\n5\n\n\fNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort decisionmaking of households\nas well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to know the\noutlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and global slack:\nIt is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity utilization\ntighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—whom many consider the Moses of\nmonetary policy—reminds us that inflation, defined as “a steady and sustained rise in prices,” is\n“always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”4 Bearing this in mind, we must be careful\nwith the deployment of our monetary initiatives.\nAs the nation‟s central bank, the Fed performs two major roles. One is the standard conduct of\nmonetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve\nour long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment. In performing that role,\nthe Fed has lowered short-term interest rates to help cushion the economic downturn.\nThe Fed‟s other role is to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when\nconfidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails\ntargeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances. Reflecting\nthe larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal Reserve has extended its lender\nof last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive\nin putting programs in place to revive the functioning of key credit markets and pull the economy\naway from the brink. These actions are not permanent injections of money that may later fuel\ninflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize malfunctioning markets. As\nsuch, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable growth and price stability.\nThe Congress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good\nnews is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it\nshould propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of\neconomic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time\npasses.\nPeople are understandably nervous about the combination of a dramatic expansion of the Fed‟s\nbalance sheet and a ballooning of federal budget deficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the\nBook of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the\nFed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the\nfuture course of interest rates.\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations\nin mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of\ncredit markets and the economy, not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our\nbalance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a\nfew eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase\nif necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while\nit is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve,\n4\n\nThe quotes are taken from Milton Friedman‟s “Inflation: Causes and Consequences” in his book Dollars and\nDeficits, published by Friedman in 1968. Friedman clearly recognized that any of a wide variety of shocks can give\nrise to short-term changes in the price level. Too often, those who quote his inflation dictum fail to distinguish\nbetween temporary and sustained price movements.\n6\n\n\fthe FOMC‟s decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve\nthe tone in the private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to\nthe edge of political accommodation.\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can\nalso tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any\nlonger and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit\nmarkets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak,\nwe are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way. Chairman Bernanke spoke of\nthis just this past Monday in Georgia.\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the\nTreasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue\njust over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book\nof Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as\nmonetizing that debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent\nguardian against, future inflation.\nAlready, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, some have\ncalled for increased congressional involvement in the selection of Federal Reserve policymakers\nand a reduced role for member banks. I trust that the Congress will resist this initiative and not\nupset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those\nof Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to\naccommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the\nFOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I\nthink we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the timetested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous,\nalways bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound,\nmission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me be here. Thank\nyou for letting me serve you. And thank you for letting me tell one of my favorite stories about\nold Dan Oppenheimer, God rest his witty old banker‟s soul.\nIn true central banking fashion, I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you\nhave.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "The Economic Predicament of the\nUnited States and the Federal Reserve’s\nResponse in a Globalized World\nRemarks before Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nBeijing, China\nApril 17, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Economic Predicament of the United States and the\nFederal Reserve’s Response in a Globalized World\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you. I am delighted to be here at Tsinghua University, together with my colleagues, Mark\nWynne, who is director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary\nPolicy Institute, and Tao Wu, a Hubei-born senior economist and policy advisor at the Dallas\nFed.\nI may have the longest experience in China not only of any Federal Reserve official, but perhaps\nof any American policymaker you will ever meet! My native Australian father and South\nAfrican-born mother sailed out of Shanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as the port was\nbeing shut down by the soon-to-be victorious forces of the Communist revolutionaries in 1948.\nIn a story too long to tell here, my father had been dispatched to collect a dollar payment owed\nan American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They left Shanghai for the\nU.S. with more than the money due Spazier: My mother was with child—me—and I was born\nthe following March.\nSo my bona fides for standing at this lectern at this prestigious university in Beijing to discuss\nthe economic predicament of the United States (and the Federal Reserve’s response) in a\nglobalized world are as follows: I was assembled by an Australian–South African consortium in\nChina, then shipped across the Pacific to become one of the innumerable factors that make for a\ndynamic economy that is uniquely American. When I served my government as an ambassador\nand trade representative in negotiating the bilateral aspects of your country’s accession to the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), Madame Wu Yi once told me, ―Of course you have done\nwell in America. You were manufactured in China!‖\nThirty years after my date of ―manufacture,‖ I served in the Carter administration as coordinator\nof policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal. Secretary\nBlumenthal brought me to China in 1979. I mention this for a reason. That early experience in\nChina, coupled with my involvement 20 years later as deputy U.S. trade representative in\nnegotiating China’s accession to the WTO for President Clinton, forms the lens through which I\nnow view China’s success, challenges and potential.\nI am going to anchor my remarks today with some perspectives gained from that trip to China in\n1979. Then I will turn to the economic situation of the United States and the Federal Reserve’s\nresponse, in keeping with our duties as the central bank of the largest economy in the world.\nFinally, I will endeavor to answer any questions you wish to ask.\nThroughout, please bear in mind that I am a Texan. Texans speak plainly and directly. In an\nacademic setting like Tsinghua, I trust you will consider my candor as keeping fully in the spirit\nof intellectual exchange.\nA Short Historical Perspective\nPresident Nixon famously normalized political relations with China in his meetings with Mao\nZedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell to President Carter, however, to settle the counterclaims\n1\n\n\fbetween the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949. Chairman\nMao’s forces did not seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but they did seize the railroad\nstock and other assets the U.S. had lent to the Nationalist government; the U.S. government, in\nturn, retaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims,\nwe could not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, at the\nbehest of President Carter, Secretary Blumenthal and his team, including me as the secretary’s\nfaithful chef de cabinet, dispatched to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with\nSecretary Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu, then with Deng\nXiaoping and Chairman Hua Guofeng.1 We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after\narduous negotiations with Deng, and that day officially raised the flag over the American\nEmbassy in Beijing, establishing the fulsome diplomatic presence of the United States in China.\nThe memories of that trip flooded back as I prepared for today’s lecture.\nWhen we landed in Beijing on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, our delegation was whisked off to\nthe official guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because\nthe route had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What\ntraffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and\ncountless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing\nZhou’s ―four modernizations.‖\nThat was my first hands-on impression of China: There were no cars. Imagine that! Now, 30\nyears later, anybody attempting to navigate Chang’an Avenue on a bicycle would be taking his\nlife in his hands. Beijing alone has over 2.5 million cars, and China overall roughly 40 million.\nAfter we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims, we flew to Shanghai on a People’s\nLiberation Army plane for a little R&R before returning to Beijing to tidy up some fine points\nand sign our accord. Your government had thoughtfully picked out the prettiest military women\nthey could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight. On a whim, my counterpart and seat\nmate from the State Department, Robert Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs,\ntook out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would\nhave thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been\nseen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came\nto the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology that allowed\nphotographs to develop after only a minute or so. Think about that. This was roughly a quarter\ncentury after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four years after the first userfriendly personal computer was brought to market by Steve Jobs and the Apple Corporation. Yet,\nthe Chinese public had never seen an ―instant‖ camera, let alone heard of a personal computer.\nPolaroid has since filed for bankruptcy, having been overtaken by microprocessor-driven\nelectronic cameras and photo-capable cell phones. Today, China annually produces roughly 100\nmillion microcomputers, and it has 650 million domestic cell phone subscribers. Your country\n\n1\n\nTwo of my favorite mementos are one of me standing above and right behind Deng in a group photo and another\nthat appeared on the front page of the People’s Daily on March 1, 1979, of Hua escorting Secretary Blumenthal,\nTreasury Undersecretary Anthony Solomon and Assistant Secretary of State Jules Katz, with me in tow, into the\nGreat Hall of the People.\n2\n\n\fhas become the world’s largest producer of semiconductors and the leading exporter of\ninformation technology goods.\nWhich brings me to China’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping entered the\nroom for the initial encounter with our delegation in the Great Hall of the People, he cackled,\n―Where are these big American capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?‖ During\nour meeting, he made a remark that paralleled his famous ―black cat, white cat‖ theme—―it\ndoesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.‖ Deng’s remarks\nencapsulated the importance of practical results over political correctness and economic\ndevelopment over ideological purity—both hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to\nour delegation that China was intent on modernization and that the Chinese cat would be focused\non catching droves of economic mice as it engaged the rest of the world, starting with the inputs\nand access from trade that would be liberated with our settlement that week.\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous\ntariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, you send more than\n$300 billion in goods annually to the U.S. and hold on the order of $2 trillion in foreign\nexchange reserves, a majority component of which are U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Until\nrecently, since Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown its economy at around 10 percent per\nannum, has become the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of\ntechnology.\nIt is worth noting that Deng and his successors’ approach to modernization differed from that of\nJapan. A contemporary of Deng Xiaoping told me that in a conversation with him in 1978, Deng\nhad decided that, unlike Japan’s decision to utilize national champions to build its economy and\nthen engage the world to leverage Japanese prosperity, the Singapore model of attracting the best\nand brightest from around the world up front would better pave the way for domestic\ndevelopment and quick growth. Thus, from the get-go, China has had an inherent stake in the\nsuccess of globalization.\nOne final impression from that trip in 1979: During that trip, we were treated to a soiree in the\nGreat Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a\nperformance of Liszt’s ―Hungarian Fantasy No. 6‖—by a pianist named Liu Shikun. Today, Liu\nis regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide, including with Seiji Ozawa\nand the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music albums of all time. He had\ngiven his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of 10, he had won the Chinese\nNational Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the age of 17, he was so brilliant in\nhis performances around the world that the Hungarian government presented him with a lock of\nLiszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius who won innumerable international\ncompetitions worldwide.\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that ―he has performed in front of\nseveral generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong … Deng Xiaoping, Jiang\nZemin and Hu Jintao.‖ What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural\nRevolution and, we were told, maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell\nand playing it day after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us\nthat February evening in 1979 was one of his first public appearances since his ―rehabilitation,‖\nand it was so stirring that even our Chinese hosts were moved to tears.\n3\n\n\fWhenever I contemplate China’s capacity to succeed in the global economy, I think of those first\nimpressions of China of 30 years ago—the paucity of automobiles and the absence of computers;\nthe determination of Deng Xiaoping to harness the best talent and techniques from all over the\nworld; the example of the triumph over misguided policy that is embodied in the spirit and\ngenius of Liu Shikun. And I conclude that as long as China continues to constructively engage\nthe rest of the world and allow the tremendous talent of the Chinese people to flourish, the\nPeople’s Republic will not only be able to withstand the setbacks currently afflicting the global\neconomy, but will continue to advance its standing as an economic juggernaut.\nOf course, in a globalized economy, we are all interdependent. To prosper, China needs and\nexpects the largest economy of the world to overcome its economic and financial travails and\nlead the way to a global economic recovery. So let me now give you a briefing on the current\nU.S. situation.\nThe Present Situation\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we\nwill have again contracted at a dispiriting rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising.\nWe currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment\nrate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could\nsurpass 10 percent by year-end. Even in Texas, the most dynamic of the American states and the\nonly large province in the U.S. to create jobs last year, we expect unemployment to rise, though\nnot to national levels.\nAmong other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market,\nwhere many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most\nrecent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20\nmetropolitan districts tracked. Prices fell 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the threemonth period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men\nand women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed an\nuncharacteristic defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the\nbest they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and\nrunning tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital\nexpenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis.\nPresently, nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the\ngrowth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as\nagricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that global trade\nwill contract by 6.1 percent in 2009.2 The WTO is forecasting a 9 percent contraction.3 This will\nbe the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized\n\n2\n\n―As Global Economy Deteriorates, World Bank Predicts Sharply Slower Growth in Developing World in 2009;\nWeak Recovery in 2010,‖ World Bank Press Release No. 2009/285/DEC, March 31, 2009.\n3\n―WTO Sees 9% Global Trade Decline in 2009 as Recession Strikes,‖ World Trade Organization Press Release No.\nPress/554, March 23, 2009.\n4\n\n\fretrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S.\neconomy.\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, considered to be the father of the (American)\nConstitution, wrote that ―the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.‖ 4\nThere is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in\nAmerica. Only when confidence is restored will the U.S. economy begin to grow again.\nCapital is the basis of capitalism. Without efficiently operating credit markets, the muscles of the\neconomic body—private businesses that produce goods and services and employ workers and are\nthe engines of prosperity—cannot function. Thus, the Federal Reserve has assumed a\ndramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit\nmarkets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank.\nOrdinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic\nagents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically\ntreasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But\nconfronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid\norder we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period\nof a little more than a year, we:\n—Established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral\nto secure those loans;\n—Initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners,\nranging from the Bank of Japan to the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to the\nBanco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Korean Central Bank, to\nprovide these foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to financial\ninstitutions in their jurisdictions. We also have put in place swap agreements with four of our\ncounterparts—the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss\nNational Bank—to enable the Federal Reserve to provide up to 10 trillion yen, 80 billion euro,\n30 billion in sterling and 40 billion in Swiss franc liquidity to U.S. financial institutions as a\nreciprocal prophylactic measure;\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n\n4\n\nSpeech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention on the Judicial Power, June 20, 1788.\n5\n\n\f—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced, and just recently fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of assetbacked securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility that we have since stated we were\nprepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned\n$200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the\nnext six months to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to\nbetween zero and one-quarter of 1 percent. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge\nbanks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more\nas we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly shortterm Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate,\nwe have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough\nroad. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back\non the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n1) Planting the seeds of future inflation; and\n2) Setting the stage for a demise of the dollar.\nI understand these concerns. Especially from a Chinese perspective. Just as the effects of the\narduous work and admirable thrift of the Chinese people are coming into fruition, your largest\nexport market and source of much investment—the United States—enters a bone-crushing\nrecession. And simultaneously, the largest and most liquid market for investing the hard-earned\nsavings and reserves you have accumulated have become extraordinarily volatile.\nIt would be only natural for your leaders to wonder if the remedies we are applying to treat our\neconomic pathology might eventually result in inflation and depreciation of the dollar.\nSo let me address each of these concerns in order.\n\n6\n\n\fFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to\nconduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently,\nthe risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And\nwe seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or\na debasement of our currency.\nI have a reputation for being the most ―hawkish‖ participant in the deliberations of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. I do not particularly like ornithological nomenclature—I would rather\nbe considered a wise owl (and I certainly do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon). But I have a\nrecord that substantiates that ―hawkish‖ reputation, having voted five times against monetary\naccommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil\nspirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is\nclear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the\npervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the\nwidespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections,\ncontinually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the\nbanking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy\ngroaning with excess capacity.\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability5 (that is to say, the next couple of years), the\nproblem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollardenominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are\natypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And\nwe are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets\nthat we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy.\nWe realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and\nagency paper such as your government and others in the Asian-Pacific region.\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using\nthe new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29\npercent against the British pound. Against the major reserve currencies, the dollar has\ndepreciated against only one, the yen, and by 2 percent.\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Chinese investor had purchased a threemonth U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of\nthis past month, the return would have been a negative 1.5 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But,\nhad that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government\nbond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent.\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would\nenjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yuan terms, 10-year euro sovereigns would\nearned a return of negative 11.6 percent over the past year. The equivalent return would\nbeen a positive 9.5 percent for the Chinese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I\n5\n\nhave\nhave\nhave\nmay\n\nI have never forgotten the admonition of one of my economics professors at Harvard—John Kenneth Galbraith—\nthat ―the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.‖\n7\n\n\fparaphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new\ntools, it has been quite true that ―gentlemen prefer American bonds.‖\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in\ndollar-denominated public debt due to the profound actions taken by the Federal Reserve have\nproven unfounded.\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new\nsupply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus\n$788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.6 All things being\nequal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative\nreturns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the\nproblems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial\nthan those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain as an example of a euro-area\neconomy that led the European pack on the upside and now is cascading rapidly downhill. In the\ncase of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament\nthey are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official\npaper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to\nalternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable\nfuture scenarios.\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by\ninvesting in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced.\nThese policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for\npermanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do,\nthey will engender growth of the economy and concomitant confidence in both the fixed-income\nand equity markets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence\nboosted in the path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget\nprojections. If these policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction\nwithin fixed-income markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to\nreadjust their fiscal policies.\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James\nCarville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to\nbe the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or emperor or pope but as the\nbond market, for ―[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.‖7 I suspect this respect for the\npower of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\nOf course, to maintain price stability and faith in the dollar, we must maintain the independence\nof our central bank, the Federal Reserve. The dangers that arise when monetary authorities\nbecome the handmaidens of political authorities are documented in countless historical\nexamples—from the fall of ancient Rome to the Weimar Republic in Germany to the Nationalist\nChinese government in the 1940s to modern Zimbabwe. In 2013, we will celebrate our 100th\nanniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing\nentity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China.\n6\n7\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\nJames Carville, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 1993.\n8\n\n\fThis is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We\nseek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we must\nzealously guard our ongoing independence.\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the\ngoals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.8 In this endeavor, it is the Federal\nReserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize\nthe impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet\nof the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets\non its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit\nmarkets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another\nway, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary\nconsequences of its balance sheet growth.\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current\nfinancial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have been faced with far tougher\ntasks and have always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of\nour making. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we\nalways come roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233\nyears, the people of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of\ncreative destruction that economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any\neconomy, be it built upon Anglo-American or Asian-Pacific or any other principles.\nOur recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy and\nadaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in the\nearly 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble—humility is, after all,\nanathema to Texans—but I think it reasonable to consider our track record and our adaptability\nto be the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am\nconfident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and,\nindeed, expedite the recovery process. In doing so, we will serve not only the interests of the\nUnited States but also those of China. For without restoration of American prosperity, China\ncannot realize the successful accomplishment of the course I personally witnessed Deng\nXiaoping initiate—a course his successors have so assiduously built upon and are working so\nhard to complete.\nNow, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my utmost to\navoid answering any questions you may have. That’s a joke. I will be glad to answer questions in\na straightforward manner for as long as you wish to ask them.\n\n8\n\nFederal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury Joint Press Release, March 23, 2009.\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nTokyo, Japan\nApril 8, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Economic Situation of the United States\nand the Federal Reserve’s Response\nRichard W. Fisher\n\n1\n\nI hope I said that better than my son James, who, upon our family’s arrival in Tokyo in 1990,\npromptly spoke his first Japanese words:\n,\nwhich turned out to mean: ―My dog has a very long snout.‖\nDomo. Thank you. I am delighted to be here, together with my colleague Mark Wynne, who is\nthe director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.\nI first came to Japan with President Carter for the G-7 Summit hosted by Prime Minister Ohira in\nJune of 1979. That experience whetted my appetite for Japanese culture. So after I returned to the\nprivate sector and had established an investment management firm in Dallas, I came back with\nmy family to reside in Tokyo under the aegis of the Japan Society for most of 1990—arriving\nhere shortly after the Nikkei Dow reached its all-time peak of 38,915. This gave me an\ninvaluable opportunity to simultaneously learn about your country while providing my\ncolleagues at Fisher Capital Management in Dallas insights into a financial market reversal of\nepic proportions—insights gleaned from an office kindly provided me by Nomura Research as\nwell as from the bleachers on the various baseball fields where my teenage son played for the\nMinato Moose team in the Tokyo Senior Boys Spring League.2\nSeven years later, I rejoined the government and served President Clinton as deputy U.S. trade\nrepresentative in numerous bilateral negotiations with your government. I also served as cochair\nwith Deputy Foreign Minister Haraguchi of the multiyear, joint commission set up by Prime\nMinister Hashimoto and President Clinton on deregulation and competition. In this commission,\nwe wrestled with everything from laws governing retail stores to electricity distribution to bid\nrigging in construction to financial deregulation and even what I referred to then as ―mini-micro‖\nissues—ranging from auditing standards to regulations governing law firms. I consider it a\nsignificant accomplishment for both sides that, today, one of the few issues from that agenda that\nremain unresolved is the matter of providing a level playing field for private insurance\n1\n\n―My name is Richard Fisher. I work for a bank.‖\nThat experience served our firm well. In 1990, we eked out a return of 0.6 percent versus a decline of 3.1 percent\nfor the total return of the S&P 500 and a decline of 34.8 percent in the dollar equivalent of the Nikkei’s total return.\nThis set the stage for a 59.7 percent return in 1991 versus 31percent in the S&P 500 and 3.6 percent in the dollar\nequivalent of the Nikkei’s total return—and anchored a run that, until I sold the firm in 1997, exceeded the return of\nthe S&P 500 by almost 2 to 1. In this sense, I owe my personal financial security to lessons learned in Japan.\n2\n\n1\n\n\fcompanies as they seek to compete with Japan Post Life Insurance, which like the rest of the\nPostal Savings system is now in a 10-year process of privatization.\nToday I have the honor of speaking to you in another capacity—as a representative of the central\nbank of the United States in my role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, one of\nthe Federal Reserve’s 12 operating banks.\nEach of the bank presidents participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the\nbody that sets monetary policy for the United States. The tradition of the Federal Reserve is that\neach member of the FOMC speaks only for himself or herself. I shall adhere to that tradition\ntoday. The observations I will offer today are my own and should be interpreted as a view only\nfrom the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—nothing more.\nI have been fortunate to see both my own country and yours from several perspectives. I have\nlearned enough about Japan from my different experiences here and my amateur study of\nJapanese history and literature to know that I do not know much. The first Western interpretation\nof Japan that I remember taking to heart was that of Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote of ―the immense\ndifficulty of perceiving and comprehending what underlies the surface of Japanese life.‖3 I have\nworked with your government on trade issues, operated an investment fund from Tokyo,\nwatched innumerable Japanese baseball games (I confess, at great risk in this audience of likely\nGiants fans, to being a fan of the Yakult Swallows, and even though they haven’t won a\nchampionship since 2001, I am hoping this 40th anniversary season for their franchise will be\ntheir lucky charm), read and re-read the classic works of Western interpreters like Hearn and\n[Edwin] Reischauer and [Karel] van Wolferen (and, my favorite as a baseball fan, Robert\nWhiting!) and studied the works of literary giants like Natsume Soseki and Tanizaki Jun’ichiro.4\nBut I have barely scratched the surface of comprehending your rich and complex culture. These\nexperiences have taught me enough, however, to be humble when addressing a Japanese\naudience of this distinction. So rather than prescribe policy to you, I will stick to describing the\npolicy predicaments in which my own countrymen and women are immersed.\nOne of my favorite books in Japanese literature is Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, a gorgeous novel\nwritten in 1914, two years after the death of the Emperor Meiji and two years before the author’s\nown death. Lafcadio Hearn offered what seems to me to be the best translation of the word\nkokoro—he defined it as ―the heart of things.‖ In this lecture, I shall try to quickly get to the\nheart of things occurring in the U.S. economy. I will then summarize the consequences for U.S.\nmonetary policy. And then, if you permit me, I will endeavor to answer any questions you might\nhave. Throughout, I will do my best to achieve the stylistic simplicity that Soseki-san achieved in\nKokoro, though undoubtedly without the beauty that is implicit in that novel, for there is little of\napparent beauty in our current economic and financial situation.\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3\npercent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we\nwill have contracted at a very similar rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We\ncurrently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate\n3\n\nJapan: An Attempt at Interpretation, by Lafcadio Hearn, Charles E. Tuttle & Co., 1959, p.1.\nTwo exemplary works by Tanizaki Jun’ichiro are Naomi, Alfred A. Knopf Inc., 1985, and In Praise of Shadows,\nLeete’s Island Books Inc., 1977.\n4\n\n2\n\n\fof 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10\npercent by year-end. Among other things, this has compounded the problem of the muchwatched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial\nmarkets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price\ndeclines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked, falling 19 percent on a year-overyear basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is\nmore pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain\nemployment have assumed a defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they\nare doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost\nof labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most\nnecessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy\nin stasis. Nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the\ngrowth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as\nagricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that the global\neconomy will contract by 1.7 percent this year, and global trade by 6.1 percent. 5 This will be the\nfirst time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of\nglobal economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, a coauthor of the Federalist Papers and considered\nby many to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that ―the circulation of\nconfidence is better than the circulation of money.‖6 There is presently a palpable lack of\ncirculating confidence in the business community in America.\nIn light of this, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative\nrole in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This\nis an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal\nReserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally\nrather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly\nand away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an\nimplosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely\nbroadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n—Established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral\nto secure those loans;\n—Initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners,\nranging from the Bank of Japan to the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to the\nBanco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Korean Central Bank, to\nprovide these foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver U.S. dollar funding to financial\ninstitutions in their jurisdictions. We also have put in place swap agreements with four of our\ncounterparts—the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss\nNational Bank—to enable the Federal Reserve to provide up to 10 trillion yen, 80 billion euro,\n5\n\n―As Global Economy Deteriorates, World Bank Predicts Sharply Slower Growth in Developing World in 2009;\nWeak Recovery in 2010,‖ World Bank Press Release No. 2009/285/DEC, March 31, 2009.\n6\nSpeech in the Virginia Ratifying Convention on the Judicial Power, June 20, 1788.\n3\n\n\f30 billion in sterling and 40 billion in Swiss franc liquidity to U.S. financial institutions as a\nreciprocal prophylactic measure;\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the\nfinancial system;\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie,\nFreddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n—Announced, and just recently fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of assetbacked securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which we have since stated we were\nprepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned\n$200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the\nnext six months to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\nAnd, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter\nof 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary\ntide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a\nseries of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our\ndiscount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more\nas we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly shortterm Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate,\nwe have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough\nroad. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back\non the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n4\n\n\fThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n1) Planting the seeds of future inflation;\n2) Setting the stage for a demise of the dollar; and\n3) Placing the cherished independence of the Federal Reserve at risk.\nI understand these concerns. And I have actively and loudly argued during deliberations of the\nFOMC that these risks represent a real and present danger. But I am here to tell you that I am not\nalone. The committee members—from the regional bankers like me to its chairman, Ben\nBernanke, and other governors—are each and every one determined not to violate the basic\ntenets of Federal Reserve sanctity.\nLet me address each of these concerns in order.\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to\nconduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently,\nthe risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And\nwe seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or\na debasement of our currency.\nI have a reputation for being the most ―hawkish‖ participant in the deliberations of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, and I have a record that substantiates that reputation, having voted five\ntimes against further accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I\nconsider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be\ncountenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a\nserious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising\nunemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity\nmarket corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic\ncondition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a\nglobal economy groaning with excess capacity.\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability (that is to say, the next couple of years), the\nproblem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollardenominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are\natypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And\nwe are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets\nthat we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy.\nWe realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and\nagency paper such as your government and others in the Asian Pacific region.\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using\nthe new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29\npercent against the British pound. Among the major currencies, the dollar has depreciated against\nonly one currency, Japan’s, and by 2.4 percent.\n\n5\n\n\fHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Japanese investor had purchased a threemonth U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of\nthis past month, the return would have been slim to none—about –1.4 percent. That is hardly\ninspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central\ngovernment bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent. A Chinese investor\ninvesting in euro bonds would have had the same experience. A Korean investor investing in the\nsame manner would have earned a return of 21 percent in euros but would have earned a 42\npercent return in won terms had he invested in three-month Treasury bills.\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in\ndollar-denominated public debt have proven unfounded. To be sure, an investment in comparable\nmaturities in yen would have earned a modest positive return of 0.47 percent for a Japanese\ninvestor. But, adjusted for liquidity, that is hardly sufficient incentive for not having a\npredominance of the world’s most significant currency in a portfolio.\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have\nenjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yen terms, 10-year sovereign Japanese paper\nearned a return of 2 percent from March of 2008 to March of this year. Ten-year euro sovereigns\nwould have earned a return of negative 11.5 percent in yen terms. The equivalent return would\nhave been a positive 10.4 percent for the Japanese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may\nparaphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new\ntools, it has been quite true that ―gentlemen prefer American bonds.‖\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new\nsupply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus\n$788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.7 All things being\nequal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative\nreturns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the\nproblems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial\nthan those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain and Ireland as examples of euroarea economies that led the European pack on the upside and now are cascading rapidly\ndownhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and\npolitical predicament you are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for\nTreasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their\nattractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less,\nattractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by\ninvesting in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced.\nThese policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for\npermanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do,\nthey will engender economic growth and concomitant confidence in the fixed-income and equity\nmarkets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence boosted in\nthe path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget projections. If\nthese policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction within fixed-\n\n7\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n6\n\n\fincome markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to readjust their\nfiscal policies.\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James\nCarville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to\nbe the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or a pope but as the bond\nmarket, for ―[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.‖8 I suspect this respect for the power of\nbond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\nAs to the independence of the Federal Reserve, let me remind you that in 2013, we will celebrate\nour 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an\nongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of\nChina. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this\nbusiness. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we\nfeel it necessary to guard our ongoing independence.\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the\ngoals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.9 In this endeavor, it is the Federal\nReserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize\nthe impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet\nof the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets\non its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit\nmarkets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another\nway, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary\nconsequences of its balance sheet growth.\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current\nfinancial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have faced far tougher tasks and\nhave always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of our\nmaking. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we always\ncome roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233 years, the\npeople of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of creative\ndestruction that the economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any\neconomy. Our recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy\nand adaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in\nthe early 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble, but I consider our track\nrecord and our adaptability the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new\nlevels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal\nReserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process.\nOne of the unique cultural artifacts that I found intriguing while I was here in Japan in 1990 was\nthe senninbari. For the Western press that is here, these are the ―thousand stitch cloths‖ that\noriginated during the Sino-Japanese War. By tradition, they consisted of a strip of white cloth\nembellished with 1,000 French stitches sewn with red thread by a thousand women and given to\nsoldiers to ward off bullets and ensure a safe return. There should be no doubt that we at the\n8\n9\n\nJames Carville, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 1993.\nFederal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury joint press release, March 23, 2009.\n7\n\n\fFederal Reserve, like central bankers everywhere, are subject to attack by the bullets of a severe\nglobal recession and financial turbulence. Perhaps we could use senninbari to protect us. But as\nsymbolically and emotionally meaningful as they might have been, senninbari were no substitute\nfor prudent maneuvering on the battlefield. As part of the team working very hard to successfully\nmaneuver our central bank through the current financial battlefield, my colleagues and I are\ncommitted to the utmost to conducting monetary policy not only so as to ward off the bullets and\nother threats to our economy but to emerge from this stressful period with an American economy\nthat is stronger and better and that plays an important role in renewing the vibrancy of the global\neconomy.\nAnd now, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my best to\navoid answering any questions you may have.\nGoseichou arigato gozaimashita. Thank you very much.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDayton, Ohio\nMarch 26, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fExcerpts from “Comments on the Current Financial Crisis”\nRichard W. Fisher\nEnough of this dismal stuff.\nI want to now put on my hat as a former investor and address the purpose of this conference:\nidentifying investment strategies and opportunities.\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" To be sure, 2008 might not have\nbeen the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we\nwork to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum\nyou may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written\nin the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the\nperiod of 1665 to 1666.\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of\nLondon—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that\nburned London for five days.\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt\nitself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by\nCharles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed\nthey last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as\nthe Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better\nand more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face\na far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity,\ncan certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the\nAmerican thing to do.\nViewed from this perspective, the current economic and financial predicament represents a\npotential gold mine rather than a mine field. Historically, great investors have made their money\nby climbing a wall of worry rather than letting a woeful consensus cow them.\nHere is a take-home quote from Charles Mackay's classic tome Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds, written in 1841: \"Men think in herds … and they go mad in herds.\"\nJust as the astute investor should have resisted joining the thundering herd's mad euphoria, I\nsuggest you resist joining in the current stampede of despair.\nBe ever mindful of the power of economic Darwinism, of what the great economist Joseph\nSchumpeter called \"creative destruction.\"\nWhile today's economic equivalent of brontosaurus die a slow death or are eventually dismantled\nby regulators, new, more adaptable replacements will emerge. Your job as investors is to identify\nthe new, rather than mourn the old, to ferret out from the general market malaise good financial\nand business operators whose franchises and prospects are overdiscounted at current prices.\n1\n\n\fWere I you—were I in my old business of being a market operator and investor—I would be\nlicking my chops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity, while those who\ngot too big or too dysfunctional lick their wounds.\nIn the parlance of the trade, there are a lot of dollar bills that can be found in the debris of the\ncurrent markets that can be picked up for nickels and dimes.\nGo out and pick 'em up.\nThank you.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSmithfield, Rhode Island\nFebruary 24, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nI want to thank Matthew [O‘Rourke] for that poised and articulate introduction. You exemplify\nthe very best of Bryant [University], Matt. I also want to thank Ron Machtley for inviting me to\nspeak today. As Ron knows, for over 45 years, I have watched this university evolve through the\neyes of my brother, the chairman of your board of trustees, Mike Fisher. I know no other\nuniversity president in the nation who is as dynamic as Ron, and I thank him for his leadership.\nI also want to take advantage of being at this podium to single out my brother. It would be an\nunderstatement to say that Mike and I grew up in a difficult and tumultuous household. Mike\nwas always the voice of reason, always the leader by example, always the ―look-to‖ guy for me\nand our other brother, Bob. All the nice biographical things that Matthew said about me just now\nwould not have happened had I not wanted to grow up to be like my big brother. Thank you,\nMike, for being a bright, shining star and for showing me the way.\nNow to the economy and our current financial predicament. The most cogent description of\nrecent economic developments I have heard came from a woman who, having just commiserated\nwith her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been like the divorce from hell: My net worth has\nbeen cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my husband.‖ The mood and pace of the economy have\nshifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal. Our self-confidence\nhas gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable situation. The\nchallenge facing President Obama is daunting.\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned\nso rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most\ntranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of\neconomic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock\nmarket closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at\n1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And\nthere were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the\nhousing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008,\na figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in\nthe United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth\nquarter. Abroad, the European Union‘s economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent,\nEngland‘s by 5.9 percent, Japan‘s by 12.7 percent and Korea‘s by 20.6 percent. And China‘s\ngrowth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest\nneighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico‘s economy contracted, as did that\nof Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer\ndebt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n1\n\n\fLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January\nand that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse\nelsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this\nyear. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed\nTokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan‘s industrial production. We might call\nthis the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and\nhysterically volatile; it closed yesterday roughly 52 percent off its October 2007 peak. British\nstocks were off 42 percent over the same period, the German DAX was down 51 percent, the\nHang Seng Index was down 53 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know\nthe consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit\nmarkets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their\nproducts shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit\nmargins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count‖ so aggressively that\nunemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBusinesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices\nand are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out\ntheir payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of\nmy colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or\nmany other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man,\nprovides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a\nlong quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current\npredicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\n2\n\n\fto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed\nand tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is\nreplaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the\nultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive\ncrouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he\nwould advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G.\nWodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It\nwas invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.‖ But my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn\ngray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus\nof the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell\nDoctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit\nstrategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to\neconomic stability.\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by\ntwo men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘\nwhenever the security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on\n[those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of\nexchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of\nthe Bank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which\nthe rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so\n... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply\nto involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every\ndistressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their\nbusiness,‖ you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\nPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1873.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n5\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n3\n\n4\n\n\f(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility\nwhich last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally\nplanned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase\nup to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie\nand Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate\ninflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on\naging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money\nand are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits).\nSimultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the\n5\n\n\fBoard of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as\nto lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve‘s balance sheet. As of Feb. 18, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—an almost twofold\nincrease from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet\neven more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries,\nexpanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different\nforms of asset-backed paper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the\nexpansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive\nexpansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks‘ balances,\nFederal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation\nwas associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank‘s balance\nsheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term\nTreasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we\nhave raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron\nsaint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\n6\n\n\fI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\nand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\nby most everyone‘s accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.6 This ―guesstimation‖\nis based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price\ntag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the\nbank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget\nabout to be sent to the Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be\nvery careful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as\nthis would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our\ncommitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some\nTreasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With\nshort-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries\nwould be especially effective in this regard.\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy\nTreasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio.\nSo, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past\npractice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn‘t try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts\nto do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my\nview, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive\ndistortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and\nbeyond our normal balancing operations.\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in\nthe market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum\nneeded, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind\nour interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our\ntask is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come\ndown handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that\nwill be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored\nenterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixedrate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\ffacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes\nhave been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by\nPresident Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only\ntime will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without\nencumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term\neconomic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to funding, if any, of the\nTreasury‘s proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more stable\nand viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday‘s New York Times, that\nneeds to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than ―bailing out losers.‖7 And, on\ntop of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have\ndug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are\nalready on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson‘s foundation calculates\nat $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.8 If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary\nHeimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic\nprosperity.\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became\nfrustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the\nvenerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked,\n―Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats\nwhen it comes to spending money?‖ Cohen‘s reply was classic: ―Sir, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.‖\nMr. Cohen might have been a more ―equal opportunity‖ wisecracker were he still around. No\nmatter. We are beyond the point of either party‘s placing its immediate political needs ahead of\nthe welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that\nPresident Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House\nand Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of\n7\n\n―Start Up the Risk-Takers,‖ by Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Feb. 22, 2009.\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\n\n8\n\n\funfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our\nlong-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central\nbanks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended,\nthese liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\nI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind\nboth the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply\nour own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a\nmandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation, and maintain price\nstability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in\nancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖9\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. The Fed under Paul\nVolcker‘s leadership was certainly a ―nuisance,‖ but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone\nalive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of\neconomic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by offering a recommendation to our\nlawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised\nprotectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, ―buy American‖ provisions and restrictions on\ncapital flows. What made the Great Depression ―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which\neveryone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that\nbegan when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and\nresidential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the\nfinancial panic of 1873.\n9\n\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n9\n\n\fIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\nfree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.10 It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying ―Have a nice day!‖ and walking off the stage.\nHowever, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another\nsourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my\ncolleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the\nFederal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater ―stress test.‖ To\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ‘29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\nFirst, he said: ―You‘re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.‖\nSecond: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.‖\nThird: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the\ncountry.‖\nAnd fourth: ―You‘re right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane,\nreasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground\namong all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that\nconfront them.‖\nThis became known as ―Old Doc Nadler‘s Remedy,‖ and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of\nus preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\nI conclude where I started, with the example of my brother. It sounds trite, but to me, your\nchairman, Mike Fisher, is the embodiment of the principle that when the going gets tough, the\ntough get going. Against sometimes overwhelming odds, he lifted himself—and me alongside\nhim—up to great heights through sheer hard work and faith in the American Dream. It may seem\nlike the stuff of the wildest dreams to imagine our getting this economy out from its current\nnightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in\nmy soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the\nchallenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I\nwould now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n10\n\nThe NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Feb. 2, 2009.\n10\n\n\f"

            "content": "Albert H. Gordon Lecture:\nComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRemarks at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAlbert H. Gordon Lecture:\nComments on the Current Financial Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Dean [David] Ellwood. Nancy and I are proud of our almost 40-year involvement\nwith Harvard College and the Kennedy School and are especially grateful that our four children\nwere blessed with a Harvard education.\nI am delighted to see so many friends from our various stages of Harvard life here tonight. I am\ntremendously honored to give this Albert H. Gordon Lecture. Al Gordon is 105 years old and an\nexemplar to us all—especially to stock pickers. I am told that on his birthday five years ago, he\nquipped that, having reached 100, he was ―going to split, two for one.‖ The world would have\nbeen doubly enriched had he been able to do so.\nThis is humbling in more ways than one. Yesterday morning, as I got on the plane to fly up here,\nI turned to Nancy and said, ―In your wildest dreams did you ever envision me following in the\nfootsteps of George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Ban Ki-moon in giving the Gordon\nLecture at the Kennedy School?‖ And she replied, ―I hate to let you down, Richard, but after 35\nyears of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.‖\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned\nso rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most\ntranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of\neconomic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock\nmarket closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at\n1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And\nthere were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the\nhousing market but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008,\na figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in\nthe United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth\nquarter. Abroad, the European Union‘s economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent,\nEngland‘s by 5.9 percent, Japan‘s by 12.7 percent and Korea‘s by 20.6 percent. And China‘s\ngrowth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest\nneighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico‘s economy contracted, as did that\nof Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer\ndebt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\nLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January\nand that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse\n1\n\n\felsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this\nyear. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed\nTokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan‘s industrial production. We might call\nthis the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and\nhysterically volatile; it closed today roughly 50 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks\nare off 40 percent over the same period, the German DAX is down 49 percent, the Hang Seng\nIndex is down 55 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know\nthe consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit\nmarkets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their\nproducts shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit\nmargins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count‖ so aggressively that\nunemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBusinesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices\nand are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out\ntheir payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of\nmy colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or\nmany other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man,\nprovides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a\nlong quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current\npredicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n2\n\n\f―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed\nand tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is\nreplaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the\nultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive\ncrouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he\nwould advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G.\nWodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It\nwas invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.‖ But my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn\ngray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus\nof the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell\nDoctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit\nstrategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to\neconomic stability.\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by\ntwo men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘\nwhenever the security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on\n[those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of\nexchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of\nthe Bank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which\nthe rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so\n... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply\nto involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every\ndistressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their\nbusiness,‖ you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\nPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1873.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n5\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n3\n\n4\n\n\fWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility\nwhich last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally\nplanned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase\nup to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie\nand Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate\ninflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on\naging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money\nand are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits).\nSimultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the\nBoard of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as\nto lower the cost of credit to the economy.\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve‘s balance sheet. As of today, the total\nfootings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.75 trillion—an almost twofold increase\n5\n\n\ffrom when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even\nmore should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries,\nexpanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different\nforms of asset-backed paper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the\nexpansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive\nexpansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks‘ balances,\nFederal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation\nwas associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank‘s balance\nsheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term\nTreasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we\nhave raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron\nsaint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\n6\n\n\fand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\nby most everyone‘s accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009. 6 This ―guesstimation‖\nis based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price\ntag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the\nbank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget\nabout to be sent to Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very\ncareful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as this\nwould undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our\ncommitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some\nTreasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With\nshort-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries\nwould be especially effective in this regard.\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy\nTreasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio.\nSo, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past\npractice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn‘t try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts\nto do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my\nview, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive\ndistortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and\nbeyond our normal balancing operations.\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in\nthe market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum\nneeded, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind\nour interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our\ntask is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come\ndown handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that\nwill be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored\nenterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixedrate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\nfacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\fDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes\nhave been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by\nPresident Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only\ntime will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without\nencumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term\neconomic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to the funding, if any, of\nthe Treasury‘s proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more\nstable and viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday‘s New York Times,\nthat needs to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than ―bailing out losers.‖7 And,\non top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have\ndug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are\nalready on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson‘s foundation calculates\nat $56 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.8 If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary\nHeimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic\nprosperity.\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became\nfrustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the\nvenerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked,\n―Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats\nwhen it comes to spending money?‖ Cohen‘s reply was classic: ―Sir, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.‖\nMr. Cohen might have been a more ―equal opportunity‖ wisecracker were he still around. No\nmatter. We are beyond the point of either party‘s placing its immediate political needs ahead of\nthe welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that\nPresident Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House\nand Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of\nunfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our\nlong-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central\nbanks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended,\nthese liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\n\n7\n\n―Start Up the Risk-Takers,‖ by Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Feb. 22, 2009.\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\n\n8\n\n\fI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind\nboth the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply\nour own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a\nmandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation and maintain price\nstability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in\nancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖9\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. The Fed under Paul\nVolcker‘s leadership was certainly a ―nuisance,‖ but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone\nalive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of\neconomic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on the business of\nour lawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including\ndisguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, ―buy American‖ provisions and\nrestrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression ―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley\nAct, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long\nDepression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for\nmunicipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a\ncropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\n\n9\n\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n9\n\n\ffree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.10 It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying ―Have a nice day!‖ and walking off the stage.\nHowever, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another\nsourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my\ncolleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the\nFederal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater ―stress test.‖ To\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ‘29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\nFirst, he said: ―You‘re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.‖\nSecond: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.‖\nThird: ―You‘re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the\ncountry.‖\nAnd fourth: ―You‘re right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane,\nreasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground\namong all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that\nconfront them.‖\nThis became known as ―Old Doc Nadler‘s Remedy,‖ and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of\nus preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\nI conclude where I started, with wild dreams. It may seem like the stuff of the wildest dreams to\nimagine our getting ourselves out from our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we\ncan and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test,\nAmericans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and\nagain. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I\nwould now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n10\n\nThe NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Feb. 2, 2009.\n10\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, Dan [Yergin]. It is a pleasure to be here at CERAWeek and especially to be here in\nHouston, the energy technology capitol of the world.\nA week ago tonight, I returned to Texas from Washington, following a two-day meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), some public talks to warn against the dangers of\nprotectionism and finally a weekend of events surrounding the annual Alfalfa dinner.\nThe Alfalfa Club is an institution peculiar to Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner\ndevoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongues firmly in cheek, its\nmembers nominate a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course,\nnone of them ever win and nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the\nStassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time,\nthen ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of this distinguished group—\nwhich in addition to Stassen has included my fellow Texans Jim Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, Robert\nStrauss, Jack Valenti, and both George Bush ‘41 and George Bush ‘43—is Veni, Vidi, Defici—―I\ncame, I saw, I lost.‖\nThis year‘s dinner was the first for President Obama, who at the time had been in office only 11\ndays. Alfalfans introduced Vernon Jordan as the candidate to head their ticket and challenge the\nreal president. Mr. Jordan appeared on stage in a stovepipe top hat. With a twinkle in his eye, he\naddressed President Obama and said, ―Mr. President, you may have noticed my hat. At the end\nof my announcement speech, I will pass it on to you. I must merely wear it. You must pull a\nrabbit out of it.‖\nCertainly concerning the economy, Jordan hit the nail on the head. The only description of recent\neconomic developments I have heard that is as cogent came from a woman who, having just\ncommiserated with her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been like the divorce from hell:\nMy net worth has been cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my husband.‖ The mood and pace of\nthe economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal.\nOur self-confidence has gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an\nunsustainable situation. The challenge facing the new president is daunting.\nOnly yesterday, it would have appeared to the naked eye that the economy was cruising along in\nthe most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter\nof economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the\nstock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the\nday at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a\nheating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June\nof 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most\n\n1\n\n\fnoticeably in the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major\ncreditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not\nbelabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product\nis no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008.\nBy my estimate, it is on pace to contract further throughout this year. Industrial production is\nfalling sharply; consumption is cascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and\nconsumers alike pull in their horns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior\nboom. Unemployment has increased to 7.6 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be\nheaded in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\nBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of\nprudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As\nfor stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed today 44.4 percent off its October 2007 peak and has\nbecome historically and hysterically volatile.\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market.\nBut I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock\nmarket and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing\nwhat they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every\ncost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of\nlabor by cutting ―head count.‖ They are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that\nsuppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their\nreceivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up\ntheir balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance\nsheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and\nnothing on the right is right.)\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal\nReserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men (and I hope, parenthetically, that President Obama makes full\nuse of his wisdom). Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and insightful\ndescription of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly\ncaptures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n2\n\n\f―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖1\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Leon Hale in the Houston Chronicle. It was\nwritten by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had\nnever heard of Bernie Madoff. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and\nwhat happens when what one old colleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is replaced by\nirrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate\nenemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A\nfellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise\nhis clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\nWe could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to\nsay that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the\nguillotine.‖ Or we could have just ignored it and mandated that it simply not be discussed, as the\nLatvian government did recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any economists who\nquestion the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\n\n1\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be\nfatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in\nnormal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times\nof distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good\nideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be\nbrought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century\nby two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘ wherever\nthe security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....‖2\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers [and financiers] may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖3\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their business,‖\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI recently read Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.4 It is a massive tome that\nruns for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black\n2\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1825.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n4\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n3\n\n4\n\n\fPlague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the\nintelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists\nof ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to\nattend Oxford, so they learned from doing.5 While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old\northodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua\n(―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The\npunch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the\nworst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and\nadapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of ―fiat voluntas tua.‖ We\nbelieve in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then\nsome. We have been neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and\nfinancial system. We have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the\nsafety of the bank.‖ And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target\nrange for the federal funds rate to the ―zero bound‖—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from\npursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of\nfinancial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest\nrate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing\naccess to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures\nin the system.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at\nthe end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct\nobligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500\nbillion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\n5\n\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n5\n\n\fAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero\nand one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the\ninflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and\nagain in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow\nfrom our ―discount window‖ so as to lower their cost of credit.\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal\nReserve have expanded to $1.9 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in\n2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions\nwarrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of\nmortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed\npaper.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to\nemphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks‘ balances, Federal\nReserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation\ndid too little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, short-term Treasuries\nas assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised\na few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton\nFriedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\n6\n\n\fI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex,\ntrying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty\nbound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial\nsystem and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men\nand women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform\ntheir duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware\nthat the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of\nTreasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and,\naccording to this morning‘s Financial Times, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.6 This\n―guesstimation‖ is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and an\n$800 billion price tag for the expected fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned\nto the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury). The Federal Reserve must, of\ncourse, be very careful to avoid the perception that it is monetizing the explosion of fiscal\ndeficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about\nour long-term commitment to price stability. This does not mean, however, that we should\nrefrain from buying Treasuries in this time of crisis. Similarly, we must be very cautious about\nthe dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities,\nmaking sure that our actions are, literally, the least we must do and no more. Most important of\nall, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and\nshrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is,\nindeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun\nto work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has\ncome down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages\nthat will be reset in the immediate future are based on LIBOR. Our purchase of governmentsponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities initially reduced the interest rate on 30year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record low, according to Freddie Mac data that start\nin 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer term Treasuries has\nrisen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund\nfacilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the\nA1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has\nalso not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade\ncorporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 26 percent for\nnon-investment-grade borrowers.\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending the American people‘s money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes are\non the stimulus package being hammered out in the Senate, and, then, in conference with the\n6\n\n―Fed Home Loan Purchases Fail to Keep Mortgage Rates from Rising,‖ Financial Times, Feb. 9, 2009.\n7\n\n\fHouse of Representatives. This is no easy task. Our senators and congressmen and -women must\nfind a way to give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or\ndisincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle\nthat is America. Simultaneously, they must agree to the funding and structure of a revamped\nbanking system. And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole\nthey themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care\nobligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete\nPeterson‘s foundation calculates at $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe totals over $99\ntrillion.7\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully\nplot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and\ngrandchildren.\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, I should add, I hope that they—and you—continue to\nbear in mind the limited powers of the Federal Reserve. I believe it vitally important that the\nFederal Reserve must be left alone to independently craft policies using those powers, based\nsolely on our best judgment as to what is needed to achieve financial stability and conduct\nmonetary policy aimed at maximizing sustainable job creation without upsetting price stability.\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress,\nthere is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this\nfirsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was\nbut one instance in history.\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of\nFischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it,\nhe notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the\nReichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck‘s closest confidant, Gershon\nBleichröder, is reported to have ―warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when\npolitical considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too\nindependent a central bank would be a nuisance.‖8\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to\noverride what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany‘s central bank led to\nthe hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I\nbeg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the\nindependence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political\nconsiderations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe\nharbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal\nReserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its\nsingular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a ―nuisance,‖ so be it. It is important that we be\nleft to do our job and no more.\n7\n\nFigures from the Dallas Fed cited in ―Storms on the Horizon,‖ by Richard W. Fisher, remarks before the\nCommonwealth Club of California, San Francisco, May 28, 2008. Figures from the Peterson Foundation cited in\n―Washington Must Heed Fiscal Alarm Bell,‖ by David Walker, Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Sept. 22, 2008.\n8\nLords of Finance, by Liaquat Ahamed, New York: Penguin, 2009, p. 88.\n8\n\n\fHaving ventured into fiscal matters, let me conclude with another comment on the stimulus\npackage being debated within the legislative branch. Whatever our elected officials decide to do,\nit is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism. What made the Great Depression\n―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may\nbe less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending\ninstitutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of\nVienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the\naforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany‘s\nfree trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin\nHarrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\nI have been quoted as saying that ―protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics. It provides a\ntemporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death.‖ 9 Were I not a\ntaciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global\ngrowth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives,\nnewly elected commander-in-chief and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the\ntemptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the\neconomic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nThank you for bearing with me. I think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored\ntradition of central bankers, I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might\nhave.\n\n9\n\nInterview on C-SPAN‘s Washington Journal, Feb. 2, 2009.\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nThank you, Mr. Mayor. I am especially honored that you would take time from leading our great\ncity to introduce me so generously and to suffer through my speech.\nWe have witnessed the unfolding of historic economic developments during this tumultuous\nyear. I can think of no better groups than the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth and the\nDallas Committee on Foreign Relations with whom to discuss the year‘s events and lessons\nlearned.\nThe most cogent description of this year‘s economic developments might best be summarized by\na woman who, having just commiserated with her accountants, put it this way: ―This has been\nlike the divorce from hell: My net worth has been cut in half and I‘m still stuck with my\nhusband.‖ The mood and pace of the economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an\nalmost palpable sense of betrayal. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable\nsituation.\nIn the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth.\nUnemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March. And the stock market closed at an all-time\nhigh, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day of Oct. 9, 2007, at 1,565. To be sure, there were\nsome signs of friction developing from the passion of the time—most noticeably a heating up of\nheadline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of this year.\nAnd there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably\nin the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and business books of major creditors and\nvarious consumers. But to the outside world, all was well. Even for Bernard Madoff, who,\naccording to Bloomberg news, was getting $50 manicures before entertaining friends and clients\nat the Palm in the Hamptons or on his 55-foot yacht appropriately named ―Bull.‖1\nIn 2008, the gears shifted. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor\nthem. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no\nlonger growing, but shrank half of a percent in the third quarter. By my estimate, it is on pace to\ncontract another annualized 4 to 5 percent in the current quarter with further contraction likely\nthrough at least the first half of next year. Industrial production is falling sharply; consumption is\ncascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and consumers alike pull in their\nhorns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior boom. Unemployment has\nincreased to 6.7 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and\npossibly past, 8 percent.\n\n1\n\n―Madoff Enjoyed $50 Pedicures, 9.8 Handicap, Boat Called ‗Bull,‘‖ by Mark Clothier and Oshrat Carmiel, Dec.\n17, 2008, http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aQv4Kmx.cs78.\n1\n\n\fBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of\nprudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has\nbecome dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As\nfor stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed last night at 904, 42 percent off its Oct. 9 peak and has\nbecome historically and hysterically volatile.\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market.\nBut I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock\nmarket and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing\nwhat they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every\ncost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are demanding that suppliers\ncut their prices. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting ―head count.‖ They are\ndelaying capital expenditures. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their\npayables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (If you know\nthe basics of accounting, you will appreciate the black humor of my dear friend, Janet Yellen, the\npresident of the San Francisco Fed. She recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets\nof consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and\nnothing on the right is right.)\nAnd sadly, as we all have read, the only things adorning Mr. Madoff‘s hands these days are\nhandcuffs, and he dines in less glamorous surroundings.\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed,\nwe must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including at the Federal Reserve,\nfailed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it\ngrew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of\nthe art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the\nsenior officers.\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and\ninsightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as\nit perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n―Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‗the credit\nsystem‘ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard\nof; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly\nfrom the facility of borrowing.\n―Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the\nbanks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade;\ngreat purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All,\nto be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid\ncapital....\n\n2\n\n\f―Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and\ncredulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example\nof one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n―Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician,\nand the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‗operation‘ is thought worthy of\nattention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune....\n―Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as\nshort as it is brilliant.‖2\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Lee Cullum in the Dallas Morning News. It\nwas written by Washington Irving in his famous ―Crayon Papers‖ about the Mississippi Bubble\nfiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old\ncolleague called ―irrational exuberance‖ is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure\nthing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an\notherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television\nnot long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current\nstorm. He replied ―cash and fetal.‖)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we done about it?\nWell, we could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author,\nused to say that ―there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called\nthe guillotine.‖ Or we could just ignore it and mandate that it simply not be discussed, as the\nLatvian government has done recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any\neconomists who question the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be\nfatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) We believe in\nthe power of ideas and listen carefully to our critics. And though in normal times, central bankers\nappear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the\nmonetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine. We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and\nappropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with\noverwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\n2\n\n―A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,‖ by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n3\n\n\fLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the\neconomy‘s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century\nby two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\nBagehot‘s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: ―The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‗this man and that man‘ wherever\nthe security is good.‖\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: ―We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....‖3\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: ―It is by no\nmeans intended to imply that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers [and financiers] may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.‖4\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to ―advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‗to this man and that man‘ whenever the security is good‖ and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving ―those who misconduct their business,‖\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of\nrecent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours\nof the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the\ntheories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\nI have just finished reading Ken Follett‘s magnificent book World Without End.5 It is a massive\ntome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the\nBlack Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks\nwere the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the\ntheorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not\nallowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing. 6 While the monks adhered to the Oxfordtaught, old orthodoxy of studying the ―humors,‖ of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat\n3\n\nLombard Street, by Walter Bagehot, 1825.\nAn Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain, by Henry Thornton, 1802.\n5\nWorld Without End, by Ken Follett, New York: Penguin, 2007.\n6\nWhen I arrived at Oxford 650 years later, there were women studying there, but they were kept in separate colleges\nand were small in number. The joke among women then was ―Come to Oxford where the odds are good but the\ngoods are odd.‖\n4\n\n4\n\n\fvoluntas tua (―Thy will be done‖), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually\nworked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place\nis spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies\nexperience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\nWe at the Federal Reserve have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have\nbeen neither ―scanty nor slow‖ in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system.\nWe have ―lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.‖\nAnd just two days ago, we made clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal\nfunds rate to between zero and 0.25 percent—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing\nevery practicable means of supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the\neconomy back to a steady state by employing new techniques that fit the current circumstance.\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient\ndebacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by\nother lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as\nthe Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the\nactions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to\ntheir banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12 of last year, when the base\ninterest rate was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to\ncredit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the\nsystem.\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We\nestablished a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to\nsecure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major\ntrading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco\nde México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those\nmarkets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the\nU.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain\nbanks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of\nthe financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new\nfacility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto\nloans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at\nthe end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct\nobligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500\nbillion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced\nthe fed funds rate, a process that I fully supported once it became clear that the inflationary tide\nwas ebbing. Simultaneously, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the\nrate it charges banks to borrow from our ―discount window‖ so as to lower their cost of credit.\nThat rate now rests at 0.5 percent.\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. When I finished Ken Follett‘s book last\nFriday night, the total footings of the Federal Reserve had expanded to $2.254 trillion—an\nalmost three-fold increase from when we started the year. And I believe we made it quite clear in\nour press release after Monday and Tuesday‘s meeting of the FOMC that we stand ready to grow\n5\n\n\four balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. For example, we will expand purchases\nof mortgage-backed securities, should we feel such purchases would be productive.\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our\nbalance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value\nof our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to\nemphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks‘ balances, Federal\nReserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right\nside of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation\ndid too little to rejuvenate the system.\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between\ncash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their\nmoney. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and allimportant private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to\naffordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to\nimprove the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In\nthe parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to\n―quantitative easing.‖ It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese\ncounterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others‘ unsuccessful attempts at\ncuring the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla Treasuries as assets and\nby shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few\neyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton\nFriedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously\nnamed Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn\nto Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein,\nit was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B),\nthereby jerking ladle (C), which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting\nperch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens\nand lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut\nstring (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby\nwiping face.\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter\nBagehot or any of the other patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times.\nOur economy faces a tough road. We are the nation‘s central bank and we are duty bound to\napply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and\nget back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women\nof the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty.\nEven if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\n6\n\n\fSome of our innovative contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank\noffered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has come down handsomely. This is important as\nmost variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are\nbased on LIBOR. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed\nsecurities has reduced the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record\nlow, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971. And our commercial paper and money\nmarket fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market.\nYou cannot read a great deal into the initial response to an FOMC meeting. The markets need\ntime to digest the signals being sent, especially when we are declaring a new regime change.\nThat said, I found it encouraging that one of my favorite, well-run companies, Disney, was able\nto issue $1 billion in five-year notes yesterday, priced to yield 4.7 percent—some 30 basis points\nlower than most mavens on Wall Street had expected. If we are successful, issuers of corporate\ndebt should see the cost of debt reduced over time. According to this morning‘s Wall Street\nJournal, the credit-default swaps index, which tracks the cost of insuring against the default of\nhigh-quality, investment-grade bonds, has fallen 16 percent in the past three days. 7 So, so far, so\ngood.\nYet despite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed\nto restore the nation‘s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and\nspending of federal monies lies with the Congress of the United States, and all eyes are on the\nfiscal stimulus package that will be worked out by the new president and the legislative branch.\nAs a representative only of the monetary authority, I will refrain from commenting on the\nbusiness of the fiscal authorities. With one exception: Whatever they decide to do, it is\nimperative that they withstand demands for protectionism—action that is within their purview as\ncollectors of tariffs and writers of trade legislation. What made the Great Depression regrettably\n―great‖ was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may\nbe less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending\ninstitutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of\nVienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global\ndownturn into a depression that lasted until 1896 was action taken by Chancellor Otto von\nBismarck in 1879 to abandon Germany‘s free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick\nsuccession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of\n1888 by running on a protectionist platform. As world economic growth slows and economic\nconditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives and newly elected\ncommander-in-chief must resist with every fiber of their political beings the temptation to\ncompound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic\nsituation we now are working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\nWith that cautionary note, I think I have said enough, Mr. Mayor. If you wish, I would be happy\nto take questions from the audience—as long as everybody keeps their shoes on.\n\n7\n\n―Sentiment Shifts to Corporate Debt,‖ Wall Street Journal, Dec. 18, 2008.\n7\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nGrapevine, Texas\nNovember 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Current State of the U.S. Economy and the Fed’s\nResponse (With Reference to Irrational Exuberance\nand Virgil’s Aeneid)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am a little uncomfortable speaking to cattlemen. It is true that we have a family ranch in East\nTexas—a few thousand acres straddling the Titus and Franklin county lines. We don’t run a feed\nyard, but we did run up to 600 mother cows in our pastures until it finally dawned on us that\ncows graze on dollar bills. We never made a profit from those animals and now simply lease our\ngrazing land to others. So I admit to knowing slim to none about cattle. We do own a couple\ndozen Longhorns, however. For the past few years, we have bred them with a pure, red\nSimmental bull that weighs in at over a ton and have covered our costs by selling the offspring.\nOur bull’s name used to be Mr. T. In honor of Alan Greenspan, I had Mr. T re-registered as\nIrrational Exuberance.\nWhen Chairman Greenspan retired, we had a farewell dinner for him at the Dallas Fed. We had\nhis picture taken alongside a huge poster of our handsome breeder and gave him a lifetime pass\nto come visit our ranch at any time to pet him. About a week later, I received a copy of the photo\non which Alan had inscribed: “Richard—Irrational Exuberance is truly a lot of bull.”\nSimmentals are thought to be docile and easy to manage. Yet they are also known for their\nextreme muscle patterns and leanness. When a 2,000-plus-pound Simmental bull in a pasture full\nof Longhorn cows becomes … uh … exuberant … he is nearly impossible to tame until his\nenergies are spent. An extremely muscular economy and robust financial system like that of the\nUnited States is not all that dissimilar. Academics and armchair pundits may think them easy to\nmanage. Yet, despite all the advances in economic theory and risk management techniques, when\nthe economy and financial markets get too headstrong and frisky, they are hard to rein in.\nEconomists like to say that one of the purposes of a central bank like the Federal Reserve is to\n“tame the animal spirits of the economy,” employing monetary policy to keep the nation on the\npath to sustainable, noninflationary growth. One of the greatest of Federal Reserve chairmen,\nWilliam McChesney Martin, once said that the job of the Fed is “to take away the punch bowl\njust as the party gets going.” As I speak to you today, we are in the midst of experiencing the\nconsequences of the failure to take away the punch bowl and of allowing the exuberant “animal\nspirits” of our economy to get out of hand. We must never allow this to happen again. But first\nwe must deal with the situation at hand. This is what I wish to speak to you about today: our\neconomic predicament and what the Federal Reserve, the nation’s central bank, is doing about it.\nFirst, a little background. Let me read to you what I consider to be the most insightful description\nof what we have just witnessed.\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when\n‘the credit system’ … expands to full luxuriance; everyone trusts everybody; a\n\n1\n\n\fbad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies\nplain and open; and men … dash forward boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally\ndiscounted at the banks…. Every one … talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard\nbut gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and\nimmense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in\npromise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital….\n“Speculative and dreaming … men … relate their dreams and projects to the\nignorant and credulous, dazzle them with [their] golden visions, and set them\nmaddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation\nrises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble.…\n“Speculation … renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a\nregion of enchantment.… No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention that does\nnot double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not\npromise an immediate fortune.…\n“Could this delusion always last, … life … would indeed be a golden dream; but\n[the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.”\nThis was not written in a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal or the Dallas Morning News or\nthe Amarillo Globe-News, the Oklahoman, or the Albuquerque Journal. It was written by\nWashington Irving in 1719 in his famous “Crayon Papers” about the speculative disaster known\nas the Mississippi Bubble.\nI am pretty confident that Washington Irving had never heard of a subprime mortgage or of\nCountrywide Financial, of a credit default swap or Lehman Brothers, multisector collateralized\ndebt obligations or AIG, or any of the other modern financial innovations and agents that have\nproven so vexing to credit markets and financial stability. But he understood booms propelled by\ngreed and tomfoolery and what happens when the “animal spirits” of the markets are allowed to\nrun amok. He did not need a modern-day figure like Warren Buffett to warn that we must\n“beware of geeks bearing formulas.” For common sense told him that eventually, the “short but\nbrilliant” phenomenon of irrational exuberance bursts and is most often replaced by irrational\nfear. What was a sure thing yields to uncertainty; uncertainty undermines decisionmaking; and\nthe confident decisionmaking that is needed to sustain the economy retreats into a defensive\ncrouch. Counterparties come to be viewed with suspicion. No business appears worthy of\nfinancing. Cash is hoarded. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins\nto weaken.\nA fellow interviewed on television the other day was asked what positions he would advise\nviewers to take to ride out the current period of uncertainty. He replied: “Cash and fetal.” It was\na clever description of a debilitating pathology. You can’t grow an economy when financiers are\ncurled up into a ball, clutching dollars for fear they might lose them. With the credit markets\nfrozen, growth gives way to recession, and confidence is displaced by fear. This Sunday, the\n\n2\n\n\fNew York Times reminded us that James Madison said, “The circulation of confidence is better\nthan the circulation of money.” The global economy has been waylaid by a crisis of confidence. 1\nIn late September, the CEO of one of the nation’s largest retailers called me and told me of a\nremarkable conversation his buyers had just had with their biggest supplier, the Chinese. In\npreparing for the upcoming buying season, this retailer—from whom a hefty portion of\nAmerican families buys clothes, shoes, accessories and housewares—had been told earlier this\nyear by his Chinese suppliers that their asking price for women’s apparel would be 8 to 10\npercent higher than last year and shoes would be 15 percent higher, reversing more than a decade\nof price deflation in those consumer products. The retailer had budgeted corresponding price\nincreases in his stores to begin this winter. Yet at that meeting, the buyers were told that the\nChinese suppliers would not only not levy the price increases they had previously insisted upon,\nbut would even discount from 2007’s prices as long as the buyers were creditworthy.\nAs the year progressed, there had been a clear pattern emerging in our economy among our\nnation’s businesses. After a ferocious rush upward of prices—not just of commodities and raw\nmaterials, but also of intermediate and finished inputs produced by increasingly expensive\nChinese and other foreign labor—producers of goods and services were pursuing a textbook\nstrategy to sustain their top lines and protect their margins: They were clamping down on the\ncosts by cutting personnel, running tighter inventories and supply lines, and cutting every\ncontrollable cost. And they were pushing rising input costs into their price structure as much as\nthe market would bear. Thus, we saw a rash of announcements of planned price increases for\neverything from chemicals to diapers to soft drinks to beer to airline fares to rail shipment prices\nto cereals to feed. Even purveyors of electronic services, like Bloomberg, raised prices by\nroughly 6 percent in midsummer. Architects and engineering and other services firms were doing\nlikewise.\nThis microeconomic behavior was reflected in the macroeconomic numbers. Consumer price\nindexes rose, and even the “core” indexes that central bankers use to sort out the underlying\nsignal from the background noise about inflation were coursing upward. In June, headlines of\nmajor newspapers announced that the month-on-month rate for consumer prices had risen at an\nannualized 9.6 percent, while the core rate was reported out at 3.4 percent. Less dramatically, but\nnonetheless ominously, the year-over-year rise in headline consumer price inflation (as measured\nby the PCE) in July was 4½ percent and the core rate, 2½ percent. This is why I was so cautious\nabout endorsing rate cuts: We were at risk of the worst of economic fates—a slowing economy\naccompanied by expectations of rising prices, more popularly known as “stagflation.” Even as\nthe majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to lower the benchmark\ninterest rate, and even as we unanimously undertook measures to counter emerging strains on the\ncredit system, the statements that accompanied our policy initiatives repeatedly stressed the\nbalance of risks between growth and inflation. After our meeting of June 25, the FOMC issued a\nstatement to the effect that “although downside risks to growth remain … the upside risks to\ninflation and inflation expectations have risen.” After our August meeting, we noted that\n“inflation has been high … and some indications of inflation expectations have been elevated,”\nadding, however, that “the Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next\nyear.” We repeated that concern in our release on September 16, noting that “inflation has been\nhigh” and “the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.”\n1\n\n“When a Nation Suffers from Poor Circulation,” by Phyllis Korkki, New York Times, Nov. 2, 2008, p. 2.\n3\n\n\fCattle feeders appear to have been equally concerned. I note that your press release of August 7\nexpressed deep concern about the impact of rising corn prices, which had reached $7.65 a bushel\non June 27 before their descent to the present level of $4.\nAs evidenced by the experience of the retailer I cited earlier, the impetus for rising prices came\nto a grinding halt as the credit crisis took grip and confidence evaporated. As the credit market\ncongealed, inflationary momentum froze in its tracks. As October approached, it became\nincreasingly clear that smart businesswomen and -men no longer had the option of seeking to\nprotect their top and bottom lines by seeking price increases for their goods and services. The\nonly option before them quickly became that of running their businesses by aggressively\ntightening their head count of employees, more passionately seeking to cut other costs, and more\nclosely scrutinizing and reining in their capital expenditures. Economists recognize this as\n“procyclical behavior.” It forms a toxic brew when combined with a credit crisis. Just as\nirrational exuberance causes economies to overshoot on the upside, behavioral adaptations driven\nby uncertainty and fear and credit constriction exacerbate the downside.\nSo what has the Federal Reserve done to counter this phenomenon? Remember that we have a\nlimited role. We are the central bank of the United States, not the fiscal authority. We have\navailable a limited number of tools. But we have been deploying them aggressively.\nAgain, some historical context. The basic manual for a central bank’s response to a panic was\nwritten in the early 19th century by two Englishmen, Walter Bagehot and Henry Thorton.\nBagehot’s prescription to counter a panic was as follows: “The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the\nliabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man’\nwhenever the security is good.” He wrote of how, during the Panic of 1825, the Bank of England\n“lent by every possible means and in modes … never adopted before.” Also bearing in mind the\nadvice of Thorton, who in 1802 wrote that “it is by no means intended to imply that it would\nbecome the (Central) Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of (financiers) may bring\nupon themselves…. The relief should neither be so … liberal as to exempt those who misconduct\ntheir business … nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These\ninterests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large,\nhowever indifferent or ruinous may be their state.”\nCentral bankers are generally considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Yet, in\nresponse to this crisis, the Federal Reserve reacted like Bagehot on steroids. We have not quite\nlent “to this man and that man.” But beginning with the announcement on December 12 of last\nyear of our term auction facility, we have reached deep into our tool kit to “lend by every\npossible means and in modes … never adopted before.” We have been neither “scanty” nor\n“slow.” In rapid order, the Federal Reserve has stretched out the terms with which we lend to\nbankers; accepted new forms of collateral; broadened access to our lending window to securities\ndealers and one particular insurance company—AIG—whose failure was deemed by the Federal\nReserve Board to present a risk to the financial system; opened a window for financing\ncommercial paper; backstopped money market mutual funds; and, recognizing that we are\ninextricably interwoven with a global economy, established swap lines to help meet the dollarfunding needs of 14 central banks, ranging from the European Central Bank and the Bank of\nEngland to the Banco de México and the Singapore Monetary Authority, the total of which now\n4\n\n\faggregates to hundreds of billions of dollars. And our staff and policymakers have provided\nsubstantial intellectual input into activities of other regulators, such as the FDIC and the\nTreasury, as they develop innovative means and modes of recapitalizing the banking system,\ndealing with the mortgage crisis and restoring economic growth .\nYou can see the size and breadth of the Fed’s efforts to counter the collapse of the credit\nmechanism in our balance sheet. At the beginning of this year, the assets on the books of the Fed\ntotaled $960 billion. Today, our assets exceed $1.9 trillion. I would not be surprised to see them\naggregate to $3 trillion—roughly 20 percent of GDP—by the time we ring in the New Year. The\ncomposition of our holdings has shifted considerably. Previously, almost 100 percent of our\nholdings were in the form of core holdings of U.S. Treasuries; today, less than a third are. The\nremainder consists of claims deriving from our new facilities.\nThis combination of measures, together with an effective fed funds rate of less than 1 percent, is\nunprecedented. We believe they are a necessary antidote to what ails the economy and a needed\nimpetus for the restoration of confidence.\nBut we also know that there are limits to what the central bank can do. Our efforts must be\ncomplemented by fiscal policy and by initiatives undertaken by other regulators. And we also\nknow that it will take time before confidence is re-established.\nI don’t know how many of you have read Virgil’s Aeneid. It tells the story of the epic voyage in\nwhich Aeneas is tested by all kinds of temptation and fury, dispossession and defeat, torment\nand, eventually, triumph as he crosses stormy seas to seek the city from which Rome will\neventually be founded. One of the great tests of Aeneas’ will comes when he attempts to cross\nthe Tuscan Sea. Juno, the queen of the gods, asks Aeolus, the god of the winds, to whip up the\nmother of all storms to stop Aeneas’ fleet. Neptune, the god of the sea, comes to the rescue, and\nas described by Virgil, he saves the day. He: “calms the heaving seas, putting the clouds to rout\nand bringing back the sun … clearing a channel through the deadly reefs, his chariot skimming\nover the cresting waves on spinning wheels to set the seas to rest.”\nAnd Virgil goes on to declare: “Just as, all too often, some huge crowd is seized by a vast\nuprising, the rabble runs amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and firebrands flying … but then, if\nthey chance to see a man among them, one whose devotion and public service lend him weight,\nthey stand there, stock-still with their ears alert as he rules their furor with his words and calms\ntheir passion. So the crash of the breakers all fell silent once [Neptune], gazing over his realm\nunder clear skies, flicks his horses, giving them free rein, and his eager chariot flies.”\nIf it were only so easy to turn around an economy that is now geared to the downside with a kind\nof turbulent ferocity that seems to equal, if not better, the powerful tailwinds that drove both the\nUnited States economy and the rest of the world on its upward slope of growth. Such growth was\nthe product of exuberant financial markets running “amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and\nfirebrands flying” in the pursuit of the ever greater returns made possible by the end of the Cold\nWar, the death of Mao, the triumph of capitalism, the onset of globalization, and the speed with\nwhich the Internet and modern technology have accelerated financial calculation and economic\ndevelopment.\n\n5\n\n\fA reader of the Aeneid will recall that after the storm that I just described, “Aeneas puts in with a\nbare seven warships saved from his whole fleet.” 2 And this is but Book One of Virgil’s epic\npoem. Aeneas’ ultimate victory does not come until 11 books later.\nThere is no modern counterpart to a Neptune who will rise from the depths and “chariot spinning\n… set the seas to rest.” The task of restoring the credit markets, instilling confidence and righting\nour economy ship will take many hands. I have described to you the initiatives undertaken by\nyour central bank—by the Federal Reserve—to calm the tempest that is upon us. Complementary\naction must now be undertaken by the fiscal authorities—by the Congress in cooperation with a\nnew president who will be elected by the American people today. It was not to distract you that I\nspoke of the Aeneid. Despite the efforts of the Fed, the hope that comes with a new presidency,\nand what will hopefully be responsible and carefully calibrated fiscal initiatives for the Congress,\nI believe we have an epic challenge ahead of us. We are navigating the mother of all financial\nstorms. We will certainly come out of it with a lesser number of ships than we entered it with, for\nwe cannot and should not “relieve the rashness of distress that financiers” and other imprudent\ndecisionmakers “have brought upon themselves.” And we know that that reduced fleet will face\nmany challenges before it reaches the safe harbor of prosperous economic growth.\nBut this much I know: We have been here before and we have overcome our problems. We are a\nnation of risk takers. Often we confront storms of our own making. We falter. We get blown off\ncourse. We lose some of our ships. But we never give up. We are a resilient people. We always\ncome roaring back, recovering from our setbacks with an even more extreme muscle pattern and\na leanness that would put that hearty bull that roams our pasture in Mount Vernon to shame. You\ndon’t have to be irrationally exuberant to know that that is what makes America unique.\nAnd always will.\nThank you.\n\n2\n\nThe sections quoted are from Book One, lines 167 through 200, of Virgil’s The Aeneid, as translated by Robert\nFagles, Viking Penguin Press, 2006.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "Addressing a Credit Crisis\nRemarks before the International Institute of Finance\nAnnual Membership Meeting\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fAddressing a Credit Crisis\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Bill [Rhodes].\nI have been wondering why Charles Dallara asked me to join this distinguished panel of\npresenters this morning.\nPerhaps it was because in the convenient lexicon of the press I am viewed as among the FOMC’s\nmost outspoken inflation “hawks” and have of late made clear that the dynamics of price\nmovements have shifted and been overpowered by the implosion of the credit mechanism.\nOr perhaps it is because I hail from the strongest economic region within the United States.\nTexas has an economy that is larger than India’s, created roughly 30 percent of all private sector\njobs in America last year, expects to have employment growth of around 1.5 percent this year\ndespite the slowing of the national and international economies into which it sells, is the\ncountry’s second-largest manufacturing center, is the largest exporting state and was singled out\nby the Financial Times on Friday as enjoying “the best” economic situation in the U.S.\nSo Charles may have wanted to present me as a curiosity. Or he may have wanted to remind\nthose of you who in your trips to the United States never venture outside the narrow Boston–\nNew York–Washington corridor that this vast American economic machine still has pistons that\nare pumping and entrepreneurs and financiers who refuse to be trapped in the conventions of the\npast and instead view the current markets’ turmoil as an opportunity that occasionally presents\nitself through the painful but inexorable process of “Schumpeterian creative destruction.”\nOr, perhaps more likely, it was simply because he may have confused me with my prestigious\ncentral banking namesake, Stanley Fischer, a towering intellect and most clever man.\nIt was Stan Fischer who a couple of years ago at Jackson Hole quipped that there are three kinds\nof economists: those that can count and those that cannot.\nSome would say that Stan Fischer’s little quip might best apply today to bankers and regulators\nwho, in the zeal to quantify risk and econometricize decisionmaking, abandoned rudimentary\nmath and forgot the basics that anchor credit and money and banking.\nLet me read you a description of fiduciary amnesia, written by one of the shrewdest of financial\nmarket observers:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons,\nwhen ‘the credit system’ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts\neverybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and\nsudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the\nfacility of borrowing.\n\n1\n\n\f“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are\nliberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts];\nnothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales\nof real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be\nsure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the\naggregate as solid capital....\n“Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to\nthe ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them\nmaddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another;\nspeculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n“Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the\n[financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of\nenchantment.... No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention that does not\ndouble or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does\nnot promise an immediate fortune….\n“Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream;\nbut [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.”\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street\nJournal or David Brooks of the New York Times, or their counterparts at LeMonde or the\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or the Straits Times or Reforma or O Globo or the Daily Mail\nand Guardian in Johannesburg (whose headline today was “Without Real Leadership, We Face\nFinancial Disaster”). It was written by Washington Irving in his famous “Crayon Papers” about\nthe Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or an SIV or a credit default swap or\nother modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old\ncolleague called “irrational exuberance” is replaced by irrational fear: What was a sure thing\nyields to uncertainty; uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking; and the\ndecisionmaking that ordinarily keeps the credit system robust retreats into a defensive crouch. (A\nfellow being interviewed on television the other day was asked what position he would advise\nhis clients to take to ride out the current storm, and he replied: “Cash and fetal.”)\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion, and no\nbusiness appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers\nand begins to weaken.\nSo what have we done about it?\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the most powerful and dynamic economy in the\nworld. It is the lender of last resort for that colossal economy. The behavior of the classic lender\nof last resort in the current circumstance is also etched in the history books, and it is well worth\nremembering.\n2\n\n\fHenry Thorton and Walter Bagehot articulated it early in the 19th century.\nBagehot’s prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: “The holders of the cash reserve must\nbe ready not only to keep it for its own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities\nof others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man’ wherever\nthe security is good.”\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its\ngovernor as follows: “We lent by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted\nbefore; we took stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on those\nbills, we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange\nto an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the\nbank....”\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Henry Thorton, writing in 1802: “It is by\nno means intended to imply that it would become the (Central) Bank to relieve every distress that\nthe rashness of bankers (and financiers) may bring upon themselves.... The relief should neither\nbe so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as\ndeeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by\nevery distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their\nstate.”\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate\nbetween the need to “advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and\nmerchants, and ‘to this man and that man’ wherever the security is good” and the equally\ncompelling need to fend off moral hazard of relieving “those who misconduct their business,”\nyou might dust off your Bagehot and Thorton.\nCentral bankers are ordinarily considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Not so in\na time of crisis. I would submit to you that the Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of Ben\nBernanke has wasted no time and left no stone unturned in addressing the current crisis. We have\n“lent by every possible means and in modes we have never adopted before” “consistent with the\nsafety of the Bank.” We have neither been “scant” nor “slow.”\nYesterday, Roger Coles walked you through the rapid-fire steps we have taken at the Federal\nReserve. Phillip, throw up that chart of the growth of our balance sheet. This picture says a lot:\nThe assets on the books of the Fed are now close to $1.6 trillion. In December of last year, they\nwere only $890 billion.\nYou will notice the dramatic difference in the composition of the assets held by the System. At\nthe beginning of the year, we were almost 100 percent in Treasury securities; now “other assets”\nand “term auction credit” represent roughly one-third or some $500 billion in our total assets.\nThis reflects what I consider one of the most significant strides taken to address perhaps the most\ndebilitating pathology of a credit crunch. I refer to “rollover risk.” When counterparties are\nunwilling to engage one another for fear that regardless of price, a borrower will not be able to\nroll over a loan to another source of funds, the credit markets cease to operate. Suppose Charles,\nfor example, thinks Richard is creditworthy. But the certainty that Bill might replace that loan to\nRichard when it comes due to Charles is suspect. Charles becomes reluctant to lend to Richard in\n3\n\n\fthe first place for fear that Richard will be unable to roll over his debt to Charles to Bill. The\nresult is that no one lends to Richard at all, even if he is creditworthy in Charles’ eyes. Thus our\nrecent initiatives to provide a backstop for funding banks, primary dealers and commercial paper\nissuers. By providing a backstop source of funding, the Fed seeks to lower or eliminate rollover\nrisk. Charles no longer worries about what Bill might think of Richard as a borrower because he\nknows he will be repaid by Richard's going to the Fed for a loan.\nThe Fed will do whatever it needs to do to be a credible backstop in support of the credit system.\nIt is traditional for Reserve Bank presidents and governors to proffer only their personal views\nand never speak for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee. This morning, I\nam casting that convention aside. I believe I can safely speak for us all when I tell you that the\nFederal Reserve will continue to explore every avenue and consider every option to see the credit\nmarket through the current crisis, consistent with the safety of the System. We will provide the\nleadership called for by the Daily Mail and Guardian of Johannesburg and others.\nOf course, we know that we cannot go it alone. At home, our work must complement the work of\nthe fiscal authorities as they seek to recapitalize the banking system and reconfigure our\nregulatory system. Thus we are working hand-in-glove with the Treasury, which has facilitated\nthe growth of our balance sheet, enabling us to keep credit flowing in the face of the seizing up\nof interbank lending and of the commercial paper market.\nWe live in a globalized world, and as evidenced by the expansion of swap lines with nine of our\ncounterparts and by the recent coordinated rate cut, we will continue to explore appropriate\npolicy responses that can be enacted without detriment to others but instead to the benefit of all.\nIn the end, there is only so much that the Federal Reserve or any other central bank, even acting\nin unison with each other and with fiscal authorities, can do. I believe we can and we will restore\norder to the credit markets and that the fiscal authorities led by Secretary [Henry] Paulson and\nthe Congress will engineer an appropriate recapitalization of the banking system in a manner that\ndoes not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs of the practice of capitalism that has made for\nthe powerful economic machine of America. That does not mean that we can undo in short order\nthe damage that has been done to confidence on Main Street—in the real sector of the economy\nwhere jobs are created and innovation and progress are realized. Contrition for the misbehavior\nof the financial sector and the realization that we have lived for too long too high on the\nambrosia of money compliantly advanced by overly eager lenders at home and abroad—that, to\ngo back to Washington Irving, our “delusion” could not “always last”—will likely be manifest in\na painful period of adjustment and subpar or even negative growth for some time, probably well\ninto 2009. But properly managed, a task to which my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I\nwill devote every ounce of our collective energy, need not—indeed must not—result in the dire\nscenarios being bandied about by economics Cassandras.\nAs we navigate our way through this difficult patch, we would do well to heed the advice of\nMarcus Nadler, a former chief of the Foreign Division of the Federal Reserve’s Board of\nGovernors:\nYou’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to\nexpand;\n4\n\n\fYou’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse;\nYou’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to\nruin or wreck the country;\nYou’re right if you bet that men in business, labor and government are\nsane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on\nto find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out\na compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.\nThese four propositions—what is now known as “Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy”—were not written\nfor some political campaign or for a recent edition of USA Today. They were crafted some 70\nyears ago by one of the world’s foremost economists to counter the down-in-the-mouth\npessimism that gripped our financial system in the 1930s. They serve as a gentle reminder that\nwe should never discount the unfailing ability of the American entrepreneur and thoughtful\ngovernment officials to solve our most complex problems—even those that plague us today.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNew York City\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fResponding to Turbulence\n(With Reference to Bob Dylan, Alan Brooke, Washington Irving,\nAnna Fisher and Marcus Nadler)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, John [Partlan].\nI haven’t been in these rooms for some 30 years. The Downtown Association used to be a haunt\nof some of the partners of the firm where I started my career—the venerable, now 190-year-old\nand still-thriving private bank, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. I went to work there for the\nlegendary Robert Roosa after graduating from Stanford Business School in 1975. He and the\npartners of Brown Brothers taught me money and banking and provided me the analytical\ntraining and insights that made for whatever successes I have had, including the investment\nperformance record cited by John in his kind introduction.\nMost important, it was Mr. Roosa, God rest his magnanimous soul, who set me on the path that\nled to the Federal Reserve. He had played a signal role in the development of the New York\nFed’s operations and later served with great distinction as President Kennedy’s undersecretary of\nthe Treasury before joining Brown Brothers. During his long career, he mentored many good\nmen—from Paul Volcker, who was his deputy at Treasury, to Mike Long, who became a key\ngeneral partner at Brown Brothers and whom I am very honored to see here tonight, to a few\nlesser characters like me. All of us take pride in having been members of a small fraternity that\nwas very much “sub-Roosa.”\nThat was then; this is now. Little about the fraternity I currently belong to—the Federal Reserve\nSystem—is sub-rosa, or secretive. Chairman Ben Bernanke has just completed two days of\ntestimony before Congress, and I doubt anything I can say tonight will be any more\ncomprehensive than what you heard from him these past two days. So I will make little effort,\nneither in this speech nor the Q&A that follows, to review or amplify upon the chairman’s\ntestimony. Instead, I am going to focus my comments predominantly on monetary policy, the\nbedrock mission of the Federal Reserve System. As always, the views I will express this evening\nare my own and not those of any other participant in the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or the Federal Reserve.\nAs I was preparing this speech against the background of recent fast-moving events in the\nfinancial markets, I couldn’t help but think of Bob Dylan’s song “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only\nBleeding).” 1 One of my favorite lyrics in that song is: “Money doesn’t talk, it swears.” Financial\ninstitutions have been bleeding, and the markets have been cussing up a blue streak lately. So I\nthought I would share with you tonight some perspectives on where we have been, what we have\ndone, where we are now and where this might lead us.\nLet me begin by reviewing where we have been on monetary policy by dispatching the excessive\nattention that has been given to my dissenting votes this year on the Federal Open Market\n1\n\n“It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” by Bob Dylan, Bringing It All Back Home, 1965.\n1\n\n\fCommittee. The morning after our meeting on Sept. 16, the headline in the business section of\nthe world’s most important daily … The Dallas Morning News … read as follows: “Bernanke,\nFed Colleagues Decide to Keep Rates Steady; Even Dallas’ Fisher Concurs.” 2\nThe less parochial among you may have read Hong Kong’s Asia Times on Sept. 18, which had\nthis gem of an analysis on the meeting: “Like an old-time cowboy, [Ben Bernanke]’s got all his\n‘little doggies’ back into the pen. Dallas Federal Reserve [Bank] president Richard Fisher, the\nleader of an anti-Bernanke insurgency calling for higher interest rates to fight inflation since\nspring, fell in line this time with the rate hold [at 2 percent], making the statement unanimous.”\nTo which the writer appended: “… if the choice was between the health of the economy and the\nrestoration of Bernanke’s authority, it seems that the economy got the nasty end of the stick.” 3\nI am not sure what was meant by that last clause about the end of the stick. But I can tell you\nthis: Ben Bernanke, whose authority as chairman has never been in question, is no cowboy. And\nI am no “doggie” (though our family does own a handsome herd of Longhorns and a fine\nbreeding bull named, incidentally, Irrational Exuberance; I consider these noble animals, so the\nterm in itself is hardly insulting). Nor am I a member of, yet alone a leader within, what some\ncynical writer imagines is an “anti-Bernanke insurgency.” I am a member of a group of earnest\npolicymakers, which includes the chairman, that places the health of the economy and the proper\nconduct of monetary policy above any personal interests or intrigue.\nThe FOMC met on Sept. 16, the day after the Lehman announcement and as the New York Fed\nwas wrestling with AIG. As we prepared to meet, fed funds were trading at up to 5 and 6 percent,\ntriple the targeted level, even as the open market desk was injecting prodigious amounts of\nliquidity into the system. And we met on the eve of some $89 billion in one day’s withdrawals\nfrom money market funds. The problem was clearly not the fed funds rate target. A rate cut was\nnot, and is not, the cure for an economy where many banks cannot expand their balance sheets,\nor must shrink their balance sheets, because of capital constraints. The case for a rate rise seemed\nboth less urgent and potentially disruptive given the clear and present danger of an imploding\nfinancial system and the considerable downside risks to the economy should that implosion\noccur. This “little doggie” entered the pen not because Ben Bernanke or anybody else had herded\nme there. Rather, I did so because I felt, as others at the table did, that holding the fed funds rate\nsteady at 2 percent was the right thing to do while our colleagues at the New York Fed and at the\nTreasury turned to dealing with the risk of AIG and other choke points in the markets.\nThis does not mean that I or anybody else at the table have abandoned our primary job as central\nbankers to deliver upon our mandate to provide the monetary conditions for maximum\nsustainable noninflationary employment growth. We do our duty when we vote with that\nmandate in mind, even if it means not satisfying the pundits or market operators who wish for us\nto accommodate their more immediate needs.\nI take this charge very seriously, as does every other member of the committee. If the author of\nthat Asia Times article, or any of you, wishes to place in perspective my votes—or those of\nCharlie Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed or Bill Poole of St. Louis, or those last year of the Boston\n2\n\n“Holding the Line: Bernanke, Fed Colleagues Decide to Keep Rates Steady; Even Dallas’ Fisher Concurs,” The\nDallas Morning News, Sept. 17, 2008, p. 1D.\n3\n“Ben First, Economy Last,” by Julian Delasantellis, Asia Times, Sept. 18, 2008.\n2\n\n\fFed’s Eric Rosengren or the Kansas City Fed’s Tom Hoenig or any other member of the\nFOMC 4 —he might benefit from reading Andrew Roberts’ magnificent new book, Masters and\nCommanders. It tells the story of Churchill and Roosevelt and their top aides as they sought to\nnegotiate the Second World War. Sir Alan Brooke was Churchill’s equivalent to Roosevelt’s\nGen. George Marshall. On more than one occasion, Brooke openly refused to fall into line with\nChurchill, and often articulated arguments that differed from the consensus of the war cabinet\nmeetings. A critic considered him an insurgent and told him so, saying that it would appear that\nhe might not hold the prime minister in highest regard. To which Brooke replied: “I adore him\ntremendously … but the day that I say I agree with him when I don’t is the day he must get rid of\nme because I am of no use to him anymore.”\nIn a committee such as the FOMC, the best service a member can render is to show his or her\naffection for the institution, its members and especially for its chairman by calling it as he or she\nsees it.\nIn my view, the situation this year has been as follows:\nSince the beginning of the year, I have been worried about the efficacy of reducing the fed funds\nrate given the problems of liquidity and capital constraints afflicting the financial system. As I\nsee it, the seizures and convulsions we have experienced in the debt and equity markets have\nbeen the consequences of a sustained orgy of excess and reckless behavior, not a too-tight\nmonetary policy.\nThere is no nice way to say this, so I will be blunt: Our credit markets had contracted a hideous\nSTD—a securitization transmitted disease—for which lowering the funds rate to negative real\nlevels seemed to me to be not only an ineffective treatment, but a palliative and maybe even a\nstimulus that would only encourage further mischief.\nI was and I remain skeptical that lowering the fed funds rate is the most effective antidote for\nsuch a pathology, given that, in my book, rates held too low, too long during the previous Fed\nregime were an accomplice to that reckless behavior. A fed funds rate of around 3 1/2 percent—\nthat was the level at which I began to stray from “the pen”—did not appear to me to be the\nprincipal problem, particularly with commodities prices soaring and incipient inflation coming to\nour shores from demand-pull pressures and rising labor costs in the countries that we use to\nsource the inputs needed to run our manufacturing base and stock the shelves of our retail stores.\nI would be happy to go into further detail during the Q&A period about my concerns this past\nyear for the risk of inflation “pass through.” Again, that was then; this is now. But we certainly\nwere seeing it continue as we entered the third quarter, even as the financial crisis was reaching a\ncrescendo. On Sept. 5, almost at the moment the Treasury announced it had taken Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the stock market had once again turned dyspeptic\nfrom fears of an economic slowdown, the customers of Georgia-Pacific woke up to find a note\ndated Sept. 4: “Please be advised that the Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP is increasing\n4\n\nPresident Plosser voted against the majority on March 18 and April 30. President Poole voted against the majority\non Jan. 22, 2008. President Rosengren cast a dissenting vote on Dec. 11, 2007. President Hoenig cast a dissenting\nvote on Oct. 31, 2007. All voting records are publicly available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n3\n\n\fprices up to 10% with selected items increasing more than 10%, on commercial towel, tissue,\nnapkins, wipers, dispensers, soap, aire [sic], and specialty products due to continued cost\nincreases…. Orders shipped on or after Monday, December 1, 2008, regardless of order date will\nbe invoiced at the new prices.” 5\nOn the day that notice was mailed to Georgia-Pacific’s customers, oil had fallen to $106.23 after\npeaking at $145.66 on July 11, the dollar had rallied to $1.42 on the euro from $1.60 over the\nsame period, and the benchmark Goldman Sachs commodity index overall had come off a July\nhigh of 473.97 to close at 374.55. I single out this interestingly timed notice to illustrate a\nbroader phenomenon of well-managed companies determined to preserve their margins after\nyears of upward-creeping cost pressures, despite the retrenchment of commodity prices. I suspect\nthat this risk, while muted, still lingers. Only days after the FOMC met on the 16th, FedEx, for\nexample, announced that its “U.S. express-delivery unit would raise its shipping rates by an\naverage of 6.9 percent in January.” 6\nBut I digress. The problem that has been ailing capital markets and, by extension, the economy\nhas not been the fed funds rate. It has been and remains risk aversion and uncertainty about\ncounterparty risk and capital adequacy.\nIt may be useful to review the emergency initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve as the\nhemorrhaging patient was being rushed into the ER:\nFirst, there was the administration of various emergency efforts to stabilize the situation. The\nFederal Reserve created three new facilities: the TAF, or term auction facility; the TSLF, or term\nsecurities lending facility; and the PDCF, or primary dealers credit facility. We used these\nimprovised devices to intravenously inject liquidity in amounts and on terms that were\nunprecedented.\nWe worked with other “ERs” as we saw the infection spread and take on global dimensions. We\nestablished and expanded our swap lines with the Europeans and the British and the Swiss and\nthe Canadians and the Japanese (and just this week with the Norwegians, Swedes, Aussies and\nDanes). Together, these central banks injected sizable amounts of liquidity to satisfy dollar\ndemand in their respective home markets.\nAnd, working with the Treasury, we cauterized certain blood vessels that seemed to burst almost\nspontaneously and threaten the system, like Bear Stearns and AIG and debilitated money market\nfunds.\nMeanwhile, other responders were at work—from the Federal Housing Administration, to the\nFederal Home Loan Banks, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the Treasury, to the\nCongress. As they collectively sought to contain the disease, they applied emergency treatments\nranging from extending lines of credit, to constricting short selling, to easing capital\nrequirements, to putting the government-sponsored enterprises into conservatorship, to\n\n5\n\nLetter addressed “Dear Valued Customer,” by Dennis B. Shearer, vice president, commercial sales, GeorgiaPacific Consumer Products LP, Sept. 4, 2008.\n6\n“FedEx Delivers Plan to Weather Downturn,” by Justin Baer, Financial Times, Sept. 19, 2008, p. 20.\n4\n\n\fnegotiating the dissolution of iconic financial institutions, to backstopping money market mutual\nfunds, to passing bills to support these various piecemeal efforts.\nThese various efforts were reactive responses. They were as deliberately and thoughtfully crafted\nand administered as they could be under the unusual and exigent circumstances. But they were\nnecessarily ad hoc. We were fast reaching a point where a more comprehensive, coordinated\nsolution was needed. Given that you are all New Yorkers, I am sure you read the Sunday Times.\nSo I am not divulging any great secrets in saying that Ben Bernanke, a careful student of the\nDepression of the 1930s and other crises, had long been warning the secretary of the Treasury\nand others that a more comprehensive solution might be required. 7 He pressed especially hard on\nthis front after the events surrounding our last FOMC meeting. You know the outcome: A\nproposal by the Treasury was sent to Congress Saturday, and both the secretary and the chairman\nhave been reviewing the merits of the proposed “package” with Congress these past few days.\nSo now a proposal has been made to isolate and quarantine the principal source of this debacle,\nthe toxic mortgage and mortgage-related bacteria, by placing it under a TARP, or “Troubled\nAsset Relief Program.” All parties have recognized that this proposal entails risk, not least of\nwhich is that every lobby will seek to sweep other festering sores—from credit card receivables\nto auto loans—under the TARP. The president of the United States summed up the sense of\nurgency last night in no uncertain terms.\nAs you heard Chairman Bernanke testify, the key strategy in the Treasury proposal is that by\ngathering these distressed assets under the TARP and auctioning them off in a prudent manner,\nsomething closer to a “hold to maturity” price, rather than a panic-based “fire sale” price, can be\ndetermined. This process would give banks a basis for marking their portfolios to a more realistic\nlevel, allowing them to clear the air and stabilize their capital base. By removing diseased\nmortgages and curing the credit market patient, creditors can begin getting back to the business\nof funding commerce and economic growth.\nOne could make the argument that isolating the infected assets that were the most active sources\nof contagion is a necessary but still insufficient condition for restoring a healthy credit system.\nThat argument would suggest that once the TARP, or whatever comes of it, passes through the\npolitical process and debilitating toxic assets are removed from balance sheets, we must next go\nabout buttressing the equity side of the balance sheets of the system’s key agents. I believe that\nafter something along the lines of the Treasury proposal is enacted, that is the next task. The\nStreet and the authorities must put their shoulders to the wheel, and I will be interested in hearing\nyour ideas about how this might be accomplished.\nEven before tackling the task of cementing capital adequacy, we need to bear in mind that the\nTARP places one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal\ngovernment ledger. Other off-balance-sheet liabilities were already in place before Washington\ntook on additional burdens from the reorganization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and\nwhatever we realize—which may, after all is said and done, be a positive return—from the\nliquidation of collateralized loans made through the Fed to Bear Stearns and AIG, and now the\nTreasury’s discharging of “x” dollars of mortgage-related securities for which there is presently\n7\n\n“A Professor and a Banker Bury Old Dogma on Markets,” by Peter Baker, New York Times, Sept. 21, 2008,\nwww.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21paulson.html.\n5\n\n\fno palpable market. (I say “x” because under the proposal made, the taxpayers’ outlay is not\n$700 billion; it is the difference between $700 billion and the return earned on that $700 billion\ninvestment.)\nForemost among the existing liabilities are some $13 trillion in unfunded Social Security benefits\nand Medicare obligations already promised to the people but as yet unfunded, an obligation that\nthe Dallas Fed staff estimates at a present value of over $80 trillion.8 The former comptroller\ngeneral of the United States, David Walker, estimates the Medicare deficit to be less, only $34\ntrillion, so let’s work with his less-excitable numbers. With everything including Social Security\nand Medicare properly accounted for, Mr. Walker estimates that “as of September 30, 2007, the\nfederal government was in a $53 trillion fiscal hole, equal to $455,000 per household and\n$175,000 per person.” 9\nWe are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm. Which begs the question: Is it possible, now\nthat so many distinguished senators and congressmen are proclaiming their concerns for the price\ntag of the Treasury proposal and are ardently defending the interests of the taxpayer, that one of\nthe outcomes of this debate will be that Congress, which alone has the power to tax and spend,\nwill finally face up to the task of squaring the nation’s books?\nJohn Plender, writing in the weekend edition of the Financial Times, reminded us of economist\nHyman Minsky’s dictum that fiscal activism and last-resort loans more often than not set the\nstage for serious inflation. 10\nWhether or not Minsky is right depends in part on those who have the power to tax and spend the\npeople’s money. They can use this crisis as a call to arms for coming to grips with our fiscal\npredicament, or they can punt by asking our children and their children to do what they cannot\nbring themselves to do. Or, just as awful, they can turn to the Fed to print their way out of their\ndilemma and encumber future generations of Americans with the debilitating burden of debased\nmoney.\nTwo weeks ago, I was blessed with the birth of a grandchild. Her name is Anna. For Anna’s\nsake, I pray that those with the power of the purse will take the high road and come to grips with\nour nation’s fiscal predicament either through deft management or enlightened fiscal initiatives.\nAnd I pray that Congress will resist the temptation to hinder the Federal Reserve’s independence\nand instead allow us to implement policy unencumbered by political exigency. For if they don’t\nand the people who deliberate monetary policy in the Fed’s hallowed halls are no longer able to\ndo their Alan Brooke-ian best to tell it like it is and act accordingly to provide the monetary\nconditions for sustainable noninflationary growth, I will fear for Anna’s future.\nVery serious matters are before us, and they require the most thoughtful responses from all\nparties concerned—from the Fed, to the administration, to the ultimate representatives of the\npeople, the Congress. Mind you, this is not the first time that the capital markets have forgotten\n8\n\n“Storms on the Horizon,” by Richard W.

Consider this description of what we\nhave experienced:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive\nseasons, when ‘the credit system’ … expands to full luxuriance:\neverybody trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad\nway to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men are\ntempted to dash forward boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are\nliberally discounted at the banks…. Every one now talks in [bodacious\namounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great\npurchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at\nevery transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer\nin promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital.…\n“Now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men. They\nrelate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle\nthem with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The\nexample of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation;\nbubble rises on bubble; every one helps … to swell the windy\nsuperstructure.…\n“Speculation is the romance of trade, and casts contempt upon all its\nsober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the Exchange a\nregion of enchantment.… No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention\nthat does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth\nfollowing that does not promise an immediate fortune.… The\nsubterranean garden of Aladdin is nothing to the realms of wealth that\nbreak upon [the] imagination.\n“Could this delusion always last, … life … would indeed be a golden\ndream; but it is as short as it is brilliant.” 11\n\nThat was not recently written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or David Brooks of the\nNew York Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Washington Irving in\nhis famous Crayon Papers about John Law’s “Mississippi Bubble” fiasco of 1719. Irving had\nnever heard of a subprime mortgage or an Alt-A loan, an SIV, a CDS, a CLO or a CMO. But he\nunderstood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and busts born of fear, and that these\nunderlying forces are deeply rooted in human DNA.\nIf this is a DNA issue, perhaps no financial system—no matter how enlightened its central bank\nor sophisticated its regulatory architecture or wise its Congress or executive—can prevent nature\nfrom running its course. Still, our country is the most advanced in the world. We have been at the\nforefront of innovation and structural advancement in biology and science and technology, in\n11\n\n“A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,” by Washington Irving, in The Crayon Papers, 1890.\n7\n\n\fculture and management and commerce and countless other fields. We must continually strive to\nbe at the forefront of figuring out how to corral the “little doggies” that are the financial markets’\nanimal spirits in a way that encourages them to work their magic of underwriting prosperity and\nyet discourages their straying from the pasture. This is not an easy thing to do. But if we want to\npreserve our way of life, and do what is right for Anna and future generations of Americans, we\nmust get it done.\nLet me wrap up this long monologue by going back to the origins of this club. At times like this,\nit is easy to become melancholy and bitter and cynical. This club, the Money Marketeers, was\nfounded by Marcus Nadler, one of John’s and my predecessors at the Federal Reserve who was\nthere “at the creation.” You will remember that Nadler put forth four simple propositions to\ncounter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial\nindustry after the Crash of ’29:\n“You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to\nexpand;\n“You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse;\n“You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to\nruin or wreck the country;\n“You’re right if you bet that men in business, labor, and government are\nsane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted\non to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work\nout a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\nThis became known as “Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy,” and for my part, it is spot on. Every redblooded American should keep it in mind.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Economic Challenges\nRemarks before the Greater Houston Partnership\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nHouston, Texas\nSeptember 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fEconomic Challenges\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Doug [Foshee, CEO of El Paso Corp.]. I am most grateful for this opportunity to\naddress the Greater Houston Partnership. This great metropolis houses a key branch of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, overseen most ably by Admiral Bob Smith from that splendid\nMichael Graves-designed building on Allen Parkway. I want to tell you that that building was\ndelivered on time and on budget thanks to Leo Linbeck’s good work and Bob’s watchful eye. Of\ncourse, we would expect no less from a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nI salute you, Leo. The great entrepreneur Norman Brinker told me when I first came to Texas in\n1973 that “it is nice to be important. But it is more important to be nice.” Leo is the embodiment\nof being both nice and important. And so is Bob. Thank you both for your exemplary leadership.\n\nThis is an exciting period in American history. We have two able presidential candidates vying\nfor the highest office in the land during a period of enormous economic challenges. The central\nbank of the United States—the Federal Reserve—is chartered by Congress to conduct monetary\npolicy so as to engender maximum sustainable noninflationary growth. To do so, the Federal\nReserve and its officials and staff must remain scrupulously nonpartisan and nonpolitical. When\nyou enter the temple of the Fed, you check your political affiliation and interests at the door. We\nfavor no party and no candidate. We treasure our independence.\nI say this up front so as to politely ask you to pardon me if I dodge any questions you might be\ntempted to ask about the presidential campaign at the conclusion of these comments.\nThat said, I thought I would sketch out for you the circumstances the new president and the new\nCongress will be confronted with when they are elected.\nTwo weeks ago, I spoke in Aspen and described the current domestic economic predicament like\nthis: The housing market has yet to find its bottom; credit markets remain tempestuous; creditors\nare tightening their standards; consumers and businesses are battening down the hatches and\nreefing in their sails. The prices of Chinese and other emerging country labor and inputs we have\ncome to depend on have been rising; business margins are being squeezed; consumers are\nsuffering from declining real incomes; savers and investors are confronted with negative real\nrates of return. These are hardly fortuitous circumstances.\nIn Admiral Smith’s parlance, having sailed the economy along for years in a tranquil following\nsea, we are now navigating Force 10 conditions. To be sure, on the growth front we have\nmanaged to make better headway than most everyone expected under the circumstances: To\neveryone’s surprise, our $14 trillion economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate last quarter,\nmeaning that the American economy produced almost $29 billion more in the second quarter\nthan it did in the first.\n\nThat said, looking off the bow, I see nothing on the horizon that would lead me to conclude\nanything different than what I articulated in Aspen: The data received since then on personal\n1\n\n\fconsumption expenditures, real capital expenditures and construction show the third quarter off\nto a weak start, although yesterday’s manufacturing numbers were a nice surprise on the upside.\nI think it is very likely we will suffer anemic growth for the current and perhaps the next couple\nof quarters. But I want to lay down a caveat: What bothers me is that this is a widely held view. I\nlearned over the years as a market operator that the consensus view is almost always wrong.\nAmerican entrepreneurs and business leaders are ingenious in figuring out how to overcome\nobstacles that might befall lesser capitalists. Still, I think it likely that our movement through the\nmuck and the flotsam and jetsam of the credit and housing debacle will be sluggish, and it may\ntake some time into 2009 for us to get the economy back up to a snappier cruising speed.\nAs to the inflation outlook, there appear to me to be even odds that one of two scenarios will\nobtain.\nThe first calls for slowing domestic and economic growth to dampen the inflationary surges we\nhave seen of late. This scenario banks heavily on the recent price reversals in energy and other\ncommodity prices and takes succor in the fact that, but for the oil patch and construction sectors\nin Texas and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast, domestic wage pressures have been tame, mitigating\nthe odds of what inflation watchers most fear: a self-reinforcing wage–price spiral in response to\nupward pressures in the cost of living.\nThe other probable scenario assumes that rather than passing through as a “one-off’ event, there\nis some spreading of the inflationary pressures we have been experiencing. According to this\nscenario, the inflationary scare we experienced of late infiltrates the mindset of consumers and\nbusiness operators alike, and they begin to change their behavioral patterns accordingly.\nIn my most recent series of speeches, I have enumerated several examples of the actions taken by\na wide swath of businesses to recover their costs by raising prices. In the interest of time, I will\nnot repeat them here. All you need to do is look at Tuesday’s New York Times article titled\n“Despite Lower Oil Prices, Little Relief for Consumers” to get the picture. 1 After companies\nhave had their margins gutted by dramatic rises in their cost of goods sold, one can envision\nthem being a little skeptical about the durability of recent price retrenchments in the commodities\nmarkets and taking advantage of every opportunity to buy protection from being victimized\nagain. Under this scenario, consumer prices prove sticky on the downside.\nThe jury is still very much out as to which scenario will obtain. The most recent inflation reports\nare not particularly encouraging. On Aug. 29, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)\nnumbers for July were released. The “headline” inflation rate for the PCE came in at an\nannualized pace of 7.9 percent. This is better than the 9.3 percent we saw for June. And yet if\nyou link May, June and July together, but for the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, you\nhave to go back to 1982 to find a worse three-month stretch for consumer price inflation.\nMoreover, if you break out the component details of the PCE, you would notice that of the\nexpenditure-weighted items—there are over 200 items in the basket whose price movements are\ntracked—85 percent increased in price, with 48 percent rising faster than a 5 percent annualized\nrate, up from 33 percent in the June period.\n1\n\n“Despite Lower Oil Prices, Little Relief for Consumers,” by Louis Uchitelle and Michael M. Grynbaum, New York\nTimes, Sept. 2, 2008.\n2\n\n\fAs every economist worth his or her salt will tell you, you have to be careful to sort out the\n“noise” from the “signal” in all these data to discern the underlying trend. Taking all our various\nprice measures together (both PCE-based and CPI-based), here is what you can say: It is pretty\nclear that trend consumer price inflation has accelerated over the past few months.\nLess clear, however, is the duration of this acceleration. The thing you have to constantly bear in\nmind is that data represent the past. It is history, not the future. To discern the future course of\neconomic phenomena you have to keep your ear to the ground, in addition to consulting\neconometric models.\nI repeat that while it seems pretty clear that economic momentum is slowing, the jury is out on\nwhether lesser momentum will be sufficient to translate into relief on the price front over the\nintermediate to longer term. In East Texas parlance, “It might could, but it mightn’t”; it most\ndefinitely has not thus far.\nIn formulating my input into the upcoming discussions of the Federal Open Mark Committee\n(FOMC), I am going to be listening very closely to my contacts in the business community as to\ntheir perception of the direction of prices while carefully studying the entrails of the models and\nother econometric tools employed by our able economists at the Dallas Fed and the Board of\nGovernors.\nI will say this much and then shift to more felicitous subjects: Within the aviary that is the\nFOMC, I am viewed by outside analysts and by the press as being the “most hawkish” on\ninflation, sometimes referred to in [Larry] McMurtry-esque language as “The Lonesome Hawk.”\nNeither I nor what commentators describe as my “less hawkish” or “dovish” colleagues feel that\nthis convenient nomenclature does justice to our approach to policy. The one thing we do not\nwish to become are pigeons. So we work double time, overtime to try to deliver on our mandate\nto provide the monetary conditions for maximum sustainable noninflationary employment\ngrowth. And doing so means we must be wary of risks on both the growth and inflation fronts.\nSo much for fowl language. I want to turn now to some good news that also comes from a close\nanalysis of the recent numbers—a ray of sunshine, if you will, peeping through the dark clouds. I\nrefer to our growing prominence as a global service provider.\nAmericans are champion exporters. In 2007, we sold $1.1 trillion in goods to satisfy foreign\nconsumers, ranging from one of our biggest exports, semiconductors, to soybeans to airplanes to\npharmaceuticals. The shipment of goods is vital to the future of Texas, as we are the largest\nexporting state, having recently pulled ahead of California, in no insignificant part due to the\ngreat Port of Houston. But a close study of the numbers makes clear that as we move forward in\ntime, our nation’s comparative advantage in global markets increasingly lies in the service\nsector.\nIn 2007, Americans sold nearly $500 billion in services to foreign customers, more than the\ncombined total of the two next largest service exporters, Germany and Great Britain. The most\nrecent data show service exports are running about 17 percent ahead of last year’s pace and have\nbeen growing at a rate of 12 percent per annum for the past five years.\n3\n\n\fHoustonians and Americans are top-notch competitors in most all high-value-added service\nsectors. In industrial engineering, U.S. exports exceed imports by nearly 24 to 1. Our ratio in the\ndistribution of film and television programs is 13 to 1. In both medical care and in construction\nservices, areas where Texas hits the ball out of the park, the edge is 10 to 1. We have an 8 to 1\nedge in information processing. I could lull you to sleep with a recitation of each and every\nservice sector, so let me just say that in over three-quarters of all trade categories classified by\nthe Department of Commerce, the United States maintains significant comparative advantage\nrelative to the rest of the world. We run a trade surplus in services.\nThe consensus view among leading economists is that growth of the global economy is slowing\npresently. Yet, even if the global economy slows in the immediate future, over time we will\ncontinue to benefit from our comparative advantage in providing services. Let’s look at the two\ncountries that everyone seems to be focusing on: China and India.\nOur chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Michael Cox, calculates that China will add $116 billion\nto global demand for medical care in 2008. India will contribute an additional $25 billion in\ndemand. Together, these two countries’ increase in demand for medical care in just one year will\nbe more than four times that of the United States.\nOr look at recreational services. In the U.S., we add roughly $23 billion a year in spending on\nrecreation. In China, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion, and in India, $16 billion.\nWe have enormous capacity to sell into those and other more-developed markets American\nservices that are head and shoulders above the competition. Why? Because we have the right\nstuff. Over a third of our workers have earned at least a college degree, tops in the world. A good\nmany of them hold services jobs and are among the world’s most productive service workers.\nHerein lies a challenge that goes above and beyond monetary policy. If we want to keep growing\nthe United States’ share of the global market for services, we must resist the siren call of\nprotectionism. We cannot expect to have our service-sector team rack up points on the trade\nscoreboard if we pull out of the game and retreat into a defensive crouch in the other sectors of\nour economy. I hope both presidential candidates and both political parties will bear this in mind.\nWe must always remember that the ultimate source of our comparative advantage in providing\nhigh-value-added services and brain-intensive goods like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals to\nthe rest of the world is the three-pound machine that sits on top of every American’s shoulders—\nthe American brain.\nWe cannot succeed in a globalized world without superior educational institutions. You all have\nheard the arguments a million times and I won’t repeat them here, except to ask you to consider\ntwo aspects of the clear need to plow an enormous amount of money and effort into continually\nmaking for the best-educated workforce in the world.\nFirst, if Texas is to become the brightest star in the American economic sky, we simply must\ndrive our universities to higher levels of excellence. As Houstonians, you should be proud of the\nfact that Rice was ranked by last year’s U.S. News and World Report survey as 17th in the nation\nfor overall excellence, above Vanderbilt and University of California–Berkeley. As Texans, you\nshould be less proud that, according to that survey, six campuses in the University of California\n4\n\n\fsystem outranked the University of Texas at Austin, which U.S. News ranks at 47th. Or that\nTexas A&M ranked 64th, SMU 66th and Baylor 76th. 2\nThere are numerous other measures of “brain prowess,” and on almost all fronts the point is\nclear: While we can be justifiably proud of Rice, we should be making every effort to bring our\nother academies up to the highest standards in order to secure our future. By almost any measure,\nwe are falling short on this front, be it the number of faculty members Texas universities have in\nthe National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Engineering or the Institute of\nMedicine or as winners of Nobel prizes or—that great arbiter of academic excellence—as\nclaimants to federal R&D dollars.\nDavid Daniel, the president of UT Dallas, likes to point to an exemplary study done by\neconomists with BankBoston in 1994 about MIT alumni. 3 That study showed that more than\n4,000 high-value-added companies employing 1.1 million people were founded by MIT grads. In\n1994 those companies grossed $232 billion. By contrast, in 2005, Dallas–Fort Worth, a region\nresponsible for one-third of our state’s economic output, reported a gross metropolitan output of\n$285 billion. The Austin–Round Rock MSA reported a gross metropolitan product of $66.2\nbillion that same year. In 1994, MIT alums produced approximately as much as the entire DFW\nmetroplex 10 years later and three and a half times as much as our state capital.\nTexas is a mighty economic machine. We cannot expect to stay mighty in a knowledge-driven,\nservice-sector-powered world unless we see to it that our major universities achieve the\nstandards of a Rice University or an MIT.\nThe second point is that we cannot expect to do so unless we develop a sensible approach to\nimmigration. Most of the time, the discussion of immigration focuses on the poor and huddled\nmasses that wish to come to our economic shores, like my parents did 70 years ago, as did the\nancestors of most every person in this room. But there is another side to the immigration issue\nthat is very much as important.\nConsider two illustrative facts: Fifty-five percent of the engineering master’s degrees awarded by\nmajor Texas universities went to foreign citizens. Seventy-five percent of engineering Ph.D.’s\nfrom those same universities also went to foreigners.\nNow consider this: These same skilled immigrants must wait up to 10 years for a green card\nwhen they are lucky enough to get an H-1B visa first. While the U.S. is busy turning away the\nbest and the brightest, other governments are thinking proactively about how to take more of\nthem in. The Australian government recently announced they will seek to increase their pool of\nskilled foreign workers by 30 percent. The European Union is considering a skilled immigration\nprogram similar to our H-1B visa; some of the original EU nations are already benefiting from\ninfluxes of skilled migrants from the new member nations in Eastern Europe.\n\n2\n\n“America’s Best Colleges 2009,” U.S. News and World Report,\nhttp://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/national-search.\n3\n“Thoughts on Creating More Tier One Universities in Texas,” by David E. Daniel,\nhttp://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/commit/c535/20080723/David_Daniel_Tier_One_Universities_Report.pdf.\n5\n\n\fSo where do you think these wonderful students that we have educated in universities subsidized\nby taxpayer money and private endowments are going to go?\nThis is nonsense. It is as though we went out and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to drill\nexploratory wells and then when they were proven, simply gave all the oil or gas away to others.\nWe need an immigration policy that encourages the cream of the crop of foreigners to stay here\nand help us build our economy and stay ahead of the competition in the high-value-added service\nsector.\nOne of my more erudite friends puts it this way: Pretend the U.S. is an NFL franchise. Everyone\nwants to play on our team; we could have every first- and second-round draft choice we wanted\nif the rules allowed it. And yet we give them away to other teams.\nI hope you good Houstonians will do all you can to influence the lawmakers of our land to\nredress our nonsensical immigration policy.\nEnough serious stuff. I want to come back to Leo and Bob. Remember I told you that they\nbrought our branch building here in on time and on budget? Well, my wife, Nancy, and I are\ndoing a major remodeling of our house. On Sept. 8, Nancy and I will celebrate our 35th wedding\nanniversary. I can honestly tell you that in those 35 years—three and a half decades—we have\nnever—not once—had an argument … that I haven’t lost. This record remains intact with the\nrebuilding of our house. So, Leo and Bob, you could win one for the Gipper just this once if you\nwould share your secrets with me. I promise to keep them to myself.\nThank you all. I would be happy to avoid answering your questions now.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "Monetary Policy in Uncertain Times\n(With a Salute to Julius Squeezer\nand Mr. Bean)\nRemarks before the Progress & Freedom Foundation\nAspen Summit 2008\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAspen, Colorado\nAugust 19, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fMonetary Policy in Uncertain Times\n(With a Salute to Julius Squeezer and Mr. Bean)\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am grateful for the invitation to speak to such an impressive gathering of technologically savvy\npeople. I want you to know what a tremendous sacrifice it is to be here in the Rockies, instead of\nsitting at home like a hard-boiled egg in the steamy summertime cauldron of Texas. Mark Twain\nfamously said that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it. Well, I\nhave done something about it: I’ve come to Aspen. Bret [Swanson], thank you for inviting me.\nAnd thank you for that kind introduction.\nLast night I had the pleasure of talking about China at dinner with a group of you. Today, I\nwould like to talk about the issues we face at the Fed as we work to create the monetary\nconditions for achieving sustainable, noninflationary employment growth in very uncertain\ntimes. But first, given the interests of this group, I want to tip my hat to information technology\nand quickly tell you about the IT side of the Federal Reserve.\nMost of what you read about the Federal Reserve focuses on monetary policy, which I will turn\nto shortly. Yet, in addition to setting the base interbank lending rate, known as the fed funds rate,\nthe Fed operates a pretty complex business.\nWe meet the banking system’s need for cash. The 12 regional banks store currency and coins in\nmassive vaults and use 132 machines to count and sort currency at a rate of 86,000 bills an hour,\nday in, day out. We clear checks. Last year, we processed 5.8 billion paper checks and 4.1 billion\nelectronically imaged checks. We moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to\nsettle their accounts.\nAnd we extend credit. Over the past eight months, we have lent considerable amounts through\nthe discount window and other facilities created to provide liquidity and alleviate strains in the\nfinancial system. At its peak, credit outstanding approached $180 billion and currently stands at\nabout $165 billion. This is on top of our currency swap agreements designed to provide more\nthan $60 billion of liquidity to European banks. In addition, we have made available large\namounts of Treasury securities to primary dealers.\nNone of this would be possible, of course, without sophisticated information technology and\nsystems. As Bret mentioned, in addition to serving as president of the Dallas Fed, I chair the IT\nOversight Committee for the Conference of Presidents of the 12 regional banks.\nLet me give some idea of the dimensions of our Systemwide IT needs. Our mainframe\nprocessing power totals nearly 9,000 millions of instructions per second, or MIPS. We have in\nexcess of one petabyte, or one quadrillion bytes, of data storage capacity. Across the System, we\nhave about 4,500 servers and 24,000 desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. Our\nnational networks support nearly 3,000 high-bandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end\npoints, both internal locations and external customers. To keep this technology functioning, we\nemploy 3,600 IT professionals. Our annual spend on IT is roughly $1 billion.\n1\n\n\fTo say that it is a special pleasure to spend a couple of days surrounded by IT professionals—\nwho aren’t trying to sell something—would be an understatement. I look forward to learning a\nlot more from you these next few days than you will likely learn from me today.\nLet me turn to the current predicament facing monetary policy makers. Keep in mind that what I\nam about to say reflects my own opinions and experiences. I do not speak for the Federal\nReserve or the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), our main\npolicymaking group.\nWe are in the midst of a fierce correction from a prolonged period of indiscriminate behavior in\nthe credit markets, a surfeit of home building, a global avalanche of cheap labor and\ncorrespondingly cheap imports, and other unsustainable financial and economic activity. If you\nwere a yachtsman, you would say that we sailed the economy along in a following sea for a long\ntime; now we are navigating force 10 seas. Everyone is battening down the hatches and reefing\nin their sails. Worldwide, creditors are tightening their standards and consumers and businesses\nare correcting their courses.\nThe correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom. Credit markets remain\ntempestuous. The price of the Chinese and other emerging-country labor we came to rely upon to\nhold costs down is rising; the cost of imported goods, and of goods and services overall, is rising\ntoo, driven in part by demand from the newly rich consumers in those emerging countries. U.S.\nconsumers are being hammered by declining real income, U.S. savers and investors are being\nsqueezed by negative real interest rates and U.S. companies’ business margins are under\npressure.\nAll these forces have conspired to constrain economic growth. My best guess is that our $14\ntrillion economy grew faster than the 1.9 percent annualized rate initially reported for the second\nquarter, thanks to exports and prudent inventory management. But I expect U.S. economic\ngrowth will decelerate to a snail’s pace, if not completely grind to a halt, in the second half of\nthis year. Indeed, we may see the slowdown extend into 2009 as the excesses that drove the\nhousing markets unwind before the economy can again gear up to cruising speed. Then, as 2009\nunfolds, it is quite possible that the economy will resume a more normal growth trajectory.\nCongress charged the Federal Reserve with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable,\nnoninflationary employment growth. We are sorely aware of the present risk to job growth. At\nthe same time, we have to be keenly aware of the consequences of our actions for inflation. We\nhave a dual mandate—the operative words modifying growth are “sustainable” and\n“noninflationary”—and we are duty bound to deliver upon it.\nA clear-eyed observer would, I believe, look at the facts and say the Fed has done its job on the\ngrowth front. The FOMC has taken aggressive action to stabilize the credit markets and has not\nbeen shy about cutting the fed funds rate. It would likely appear to that clear-eyed observer that\nthese initiatives have paid dividends: The U.S. economy has continued to grow. In fact, but for\nthe fourth quarter of 2007, the numbers have thus far been better than what most pundits\nexpected, though everyone and his sister, including me, contemplates a more anemic outlook\ngoing forward. (The old hedge fund manager in me tells me that when everyone and his sister\n2\n\n\fshares a view—when there is consensus on the street—it is usually wrong, but I still think the\ngrowth outlook for the next quarters is unpleasant.)\nAs for the “noninflationary” part, the observer would take heart from the recent price reversals\nthat have taken place in the oil and commodity markets. But her brow might knit up a bit as she\ndissects the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released Thursday. That report said that consumer\ninflation increased at an annualized rate of 10.3 percent in July and that, year over year,\nconsumer prices have risen 5.5 percent. She might also note that roughly 25 percent of our\nConsumer Price Index is a theoretical construct to capture the cost of shelter called “owner’s\nequivalent rent” and conclude that the effective cost pressure on consumers and business\noperators is actually higher than the headline number.\nAnd our clear-eyed woman would note that even as economists remove energy and food from\nthe CPI to eliminate the “noise” of those volatile items, the underlying, or “core,” inflation\nmeasure is also drifting upward on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflationary pressures\nare spreading beyond energy and food prices. Were she an economics wonk, she might further\nnote that the “trimmed mean” CPI that the Cleveland Fed calculates—another way to parse the\ndata to look for the underlying trend—posted a one-month gain of 7.2 percent, something it has\nonly done once before, in 1991.\nIt is important to remember, however, that the July CPI is history. Data are the past. The question\nthat the FOMC must wrestle with is: What will occur on the inflation front going forward?\nIn an op-ed in the August 7 issue of the Financial Times—perhaps the world’s most renowned\nnewspaper before the recent surge of the National Enquirer—one of the world’s most respected\neconomists, Martin Feldstein, wrote that the Federal Reserve “is prepared to gamble that the\nweakness in U.S. employment and the general decline in economic activity will prevent a wageprice spiral without further increases in the interest rate. If food and energy prices remain at\ntoday’s level and wage costs do not accelerate, the overall consumer price index inflation will\ndecline by next year….” 1\nWere I rewriting that paragraph, I would purge the word “gamble” because the thought of any\nsemblance of gambling at the Fed is contrary to my experience. The FOMC—the 16 dedicated\nindividuals whom I have the great privilege of working with under the leadership of Ben\nBernanke—does not gamble. To be sure, we are aware any economic outcome is subject to\nprobabilities and chance. But the verb “gamble” carries the connotation of squandering away\nhard-earned capital. The earnest men and women who make up the FOMC have no intention of\nsquandering the bedrock capital of a central bank: the confidence the public places in our hands\nto keep inflation at bay while we work to bolster economic growth and restore the financial\nsystem.\nThat said, you do not have to be a gambler to subscribe to Dr. Feldstein’s scenario. The markets\nin commodities, like those of stocks and bonds, are manic-depressive mechanisms and overshoot\non the upside as well as on the downside. One could reasonably deduce from recent price\nreversals in oil and food prices that they overshot on the upside and that their price run-up was a\n1\n\n“The Crisis: A Tale of Two Monetary Policies,” by Martin Feldstein, Financial Times, Aug. 7,\n2008.\n3\n\n\fone-off development. If you subscribe to this argument, you envision a process not unlike that of\na python digesting dinner: It visibly moves through the system, creating some moments of\ndiscomfort—in this case, a temporary inflationary bulge—but is processed in reasonable time\nand done with.\nBecause this is a serious speech, I will refrain from telling you about my neighbor in Dallas who\nhad a pet python named Julius Squeezer. But I will tell you that I learned much from watching\nthat python over the years: He was an efficient processor of most anything he swallowed,\nalthough there were times when he had to be taken to the vet to be treated for indigestion.\nIt is tempting to deduce from the recent reversal of commodity prices—in particular, energy\nprices save coal—that the discomfort manifest in headline inflation numbers that we broached in\nJuly is passing through the system and is being squeezed out by slowing economic growth. This\nis certainly a plausible economic scenario. Weakness in the U.S. and other advanced economies\nwill mitigate inflationary pressures, rendering them a temporary inconvenience. In the parlance\nof central bankers, the recent run-up of headline and core prices represents “noise” rather than\nunderlying “signal.” Given that the Fed focuses on signals about intermediate and long-term\nsustainable, noninflationary employment growth, rather than short-term expediency, it is in\nkeeping with our charter to give considerable weight to this scenario.\nI note that we would not be alone in doing so. This is the conclusion that the Bank of England\nhas been most public about as it recently ceased raising its policy rate. I have the highest\npersonal regard for Governor Mervyn King and especially for his deputy, a member of the\ndistinguished advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, the\nconvivially named Mr. Charlie Bean. I did note, however, that in reaction to the recent release of\nthe Bank of England’s analysis, the Financial Times on Thursday wrote an especially harsh\neditorial titled “Shoot the Doves,” which concluded with these words:\n\n“The ongoing disruption in credit markets is acting as a brake on the economy … because credit\nis less available and it costs more .… Keeping rates on hold looks right for now.”\n“But,” the editorial went on, “… the Bank must also worry about its credibility: if the public\nceases to believe that it will bring inflation back down, then it will become much harder to do\nso.” 2\n\nThis risk applies to the Fed just as much as it does to the Bank of England. We cannot afford to\ngamble away our credibility. That is why the FOMC has made it clear in its recent statements\nthat we are keenly monitoring inflationary impulses. In doing so, we must be wary of a second\npossible scenario, one that differs from the one summarized by Dr. Feldstein.\nThis second scenario is less felicitous. It acknowledges the manic-depressive nature of\ncommodity markets and recognizes that it was inevitable that price peaks would give way to\n2\n\nEditorial comment, “Shoot the Doves,” Financial Times, Aug. 13, 2008.\n\n4\n\n\fprice valleys. But the scenario envisions the possibility that rather than passing through the\npython, the recent burst of cost-push inflation is giving the beast digestion problems that might\nmanifest themselves in the form of a lingering inflationary fever.\nMany micros make a macro. The economy is the sum of its parts. Jobs are created by, and prices\nare set by, microeconomic units, by businesses—thousands upon thousands upon thousands of\nthem.\nBusiness operators do what they are paid to do—grow their bottom lines in good times and\nprotect them in bad. Presently, it is difficult to grow top lines in the U.S. domestic market\nbecause demand is anemic. And yet it is increasingly difficult to protect bottom lines because\ncritical components of the cost of goods sold have been rising. What comes in through the back\ndoor of most businesses has been rising, driven by fuel and transportation and other input costs.\nLabor costs at home have been restrained. But labor costs in other places where American\ncompanies produce and source goods, particularly China, have been rising dramatically.\nHere is where the globalization process hits the inflationary road. Not long ago, the newfound\ndesire of the Chinese and Indians and former Soviet satellites and the Brazilians and others to\nhop onboard the capitalist ship led to a flood of cheap labor and low-cost goods and outsourced\nservices. Our economy experienced the most pleasant of tailwinds, propelling it forward while\nrestraining inflation. Now that these countries are climbing up the income ladder and consuming\nmore of what we consume, we are facing a bracing headwind from the very same sources that\npreviously helped our economy sail along.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security reports that in the first half of\nthis year, wages in urban areas, where most U.S. and foreign firms make or assemble products,\nrose 18 percent. And, as any U.S. firm operating in China will tell you, recent stepped-up\nenforcement of job rules has made China an even more expensive place to operate.\nI cannot tell you how much we should weigh this particular cost component. Nobody knows the\nanswer to how this impacts cost structures here at home. But this much is clear: The tailwind that\nwas holding labor costs at home hostage to the threat of outsourcing production to China has\nbeen significantly mitigated. Any garment producer or hospital equipment maker or high tech\nassembler operating in China can testify to that.\nIn addition, as income levels have risen in the emerging countries, so has their appetite for raw\nmaterials and basic necessities. China, for example, now has 37 million cars; the press reports\nthat they will reach 50 million cars in 2009, on their way to some 100 million in fairly short\norder. Fueling that fleet contributes to the country’s rising demand for oil, now largely satisfied\nby imports of 8 million barrels of oil a day. As China grows, she will require still more oil. How\nmuch? Well, here is a simple calculation you can do. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal 3\npointed out that the Japanese consume 14 barrels of oil per capita each year, whereas the\nEuropeans consume 17 and the Americans 25. If China used the same amount of oil per capita as\nparsimonious Japan, China’s consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an\namount that dwarfs our consumption of 7.5 billion barrels. Add that to new demand stemming\n3\n\n“U.S. Retools Economy, Curbing Thirst for Oil,” by Justin Lahart and Conor Dougherty, Wall\nStreet Journal, Aug. 12, 2008, p. A1.\n5\n\n\ffor oil from the billion people of India, the new members of the European community, an\nincreasingly prosperous Brazil and so on, and extrapolate these new demand pressures for oil to\nwood or steel or food oils or animal proteins or anything else that growing economies consume,\nand you begin to get the picture of what keeps a forward-thinking businesswoman or man up at\nnight.\nIf you layer a Chinese wage-price spiral and demand-pull forces on top of the shiver sent up the\nspine by sudden price increases in most raw materials this past year, you might forgive U.S.\nbusiness operators—the women and men who do the spadework to create the employment we\nseek to encourage through prudent monetary policy—for doing what rational managers do to\nprotect their margins. At bedtime, they may pray on their knees, thanking the market gods for the\nrecent correction in prices for oil and gas and other materials. But during the day they are doing\ntwo things: (1) They are cutting whatever costs they have control over by reducing head count,\nstretching out inventories, pulling back on capital expenditures, and so on; and (2) they are\nseeking to pass through costs that are out of their direct control—the ones that are coming\nthrough the back door—by raising prices of the goods and services they ship out the front door.\nOn August 1, for example, the Wall Street Journal 4 reported that Unilever offset cost pressures\nby raising the average price of its thousands of products by 7.4 percent, despite having seen its\nvolume of goods sold slip by 0.5 percent in the second quarter. The article added that Unilever’s\nCEO “didn’t plan to make any major changes.”\nNeither, according to public reports, do companies as varied as Dow Chemical, Frito-Lay,\nKodak, McDonald’s, American Airlines and the various 99 cent stores. Even Bloomberg, the\ngreat electronic purveyor of financial information and news, is protecting margins by raising\nprices: Last week, they notified their customers, including the Dallas Fed, they would be\nincreasing prices by 6 percent on December 1. It was noteworthy that in releasing his company’s\nearnings for the second quarter, the CFO of Wal-Mart said suppliers were asking for price\nincreases at a “higher level than I can remember since I began at the company.” 5\nThis behavioral response, were it to become even more widespread, leads to unpleasant\nconsequences for me and my fellow policymakers. Unless the python that is the U.S. economy\ncan quickly pass the recent burst of cost-push pressures, we risk a reinforcing spreading of\ninflationary impulses and expectations. Should this happen and the Fed were to fail to address it,\nwe would run the risk of losing the public’s confidence in our ability to constrain inflation. Then\nthe great editorial writers in this country, to say nothing of Congress and the American people,\nwill be calling for all of us—doves and hawks alike—to be shot (metaphorically speaking, of\ncourse).\n\n4\n\n“Unilever’s Earnings Fall as Price Increases Hurt Sales,” by Aaron O. Patrick, Wall Street\nJournal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. B3.\n5\n“Wal-Mart Net Up 17% on Rebates, Bargain-Hunters,” by Ann Zimmerman, Wall Street\nJournal, Aug. 15, 2008, p. B1.\n\n6\n\n\fThus, I urge you to observe closely the noble python. He might digest and dispatch the recent\ninflationary surge, or he might gag on it. It is too early to tell. And until we have a clear sense of\nwhat will prevail, monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to\ncontain inflationary pressures.\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "A Perspective on China\nRemarks to a Working Dinner Sponsored by the\nProgress & Freedom Foundation\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nAspen, Colorado\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA Perspective on China\nRichard W. Fisher\nI may have the longest record of experience with China of anybody in this room, including\nChinese nationals. My Australian father and South African-born Norwegian mother sailed out of\nShanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as that port was being closed by Communist\nrevolutionaries in 1948. In a story too long to tell, my parents had been dispatched to collect a\ndollar payment owed an American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They\nleft Shanghai with more than Spazier’s loot: My mother was with child—me. I was born the\nfollowing March, the felicitous by-product of an otherwise fretful stay at the Peace Hotel on the\nBund.\nI have been asked to speak to you tomorrow about “Monetary Policy in a Globalized World.”\nTonight, I establish my bona fides for that talk: I was manufactured by an Australian–South\nAfrican/Norwegian partnership in China, shipped across the Pacific and on to Mexico for final\nassembly, and then sent across the border to the U.S. to become one of the innumerable factors\nthat make for a dynamic economy that is uniquely American. You can’t be more globalized than\nthat!\nMy embryonic experience allows me to lay claim to being a China watcher for nearly 60 years.\nBut it was only in 1979, when I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy\nplanning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, that I first saw China. I\nmention this for a reason. My early experience in China, coupled with my involvement 20 years\nlater in negotiating China’s accession to the World Trade Organization for President Clinton,\nforms the lens through which I now view China.\nI am going to focus my brief remarks tonight on some of the perspectives gained from that first\ntrip to China.\nPresident Nixon and Henry Kissinger had famously normalized political relations with China in\ntheir meetings with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell on President Carter to settle the\ncounterclaims between the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949.\nMao’s forces failed to seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but managed to seize the\nrailroad stock and other assets the U.S. had lent or invested in Nationalist China; we, in turn,\nretaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims, we\ncould not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, Secretary\nBlumenthal and his team, including me as his faithful chef de cabinet, were dispatched from\nAndrews Air Force Base to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with Deng\nXiaoping, then-Chairman Hua Guofeng—a hapless fellow traveler of Mao’s whom we met with\nonly for the purposes of being photographed for the People’s Daily but paid little attention to,\ngiven that we knew of Deng’s ascendancy—and Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance\nMinister Zhang Jin-fu. We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after arduous negotiations\nwith Deng and Zhang, and that day officially raised the flag over the American Embassy in\nBeijing, establishing the fulsome presence of the U.S. in China.\n\n1\n\n\fThe memories of this trip flooded back as I viewed the opening ceremonies of the spectacle and\npageantry of the Olympics in Beijing.\nWhen we landed in that city on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, we were whisked off to the\nofficial guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because the\nroute had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What\ntraffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and\ncountless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing\nZhou’s “four modernizations.”\nBy 2006, just 27 years later, Beijing had some 2.4 million motor vehicles, a small fraction of\nChina’s total of 37 million.\nThink about that. Worldwide, roughly half of oil production goes into making gasoline and diesel\nfuel. In 2008, China is projected to consume nearly 8 million barrels of oil daily. Let’s say that,\nconservatively, 2.5 million barrels of that goes into propelling the present auto and truck fleet of\nthe country. You can do the numbers and see the amount of oil that will be required just to feed\nthe fleet of Chinese autos as it grows to 100 million.\nWhen the Blumenthal delegation arrived in Beijing in 1979, the main customers for OPEC and\nother oil producers were the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. You may remember that in today’s\ndollars the price of oil was broaching $90 at that time, on its way the next year to $100 plus.\nNow, oil producers have as customers an added 1.3 billion Chinese, who not only drive cars but\noperate factories and require heat for their homes, as well as the populations of catch-up players\nlike India and the countries liberated from Soviet tyranny. This puts the supply and demand for\noil and diesel and gasoline into perspective. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal pointed out that\nJapan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita, Europe consumes 17 and America consumes\n25. If China used the same amount per capita as parsimonious Japan, Chinese consumption\nwould total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an amount that dwarfs our country’s 7.5 billion\nbarrels. Add that to new demand for oil stemming from India, the newest members of the\nEuropean community, an increasingly prosperous Brazil and so on. For those trying to discern\nthe long-term future of oil prices, this is considerable food for thought.\nOnce we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims on China—at roughly 40 cents on the\ndollar—we flew to Shanghai on a Chinese military plane for a little R&R before returning to\nBeijing to tidy up some fine points. The Chinese government had picked out the prettiest military\nwomen they could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight—nothing becomes a pretty\nwoman like the uniform of the People’s Liberation Army. On a whim, my counterpart and seat\nmate from the State Department, Bob Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs,\ntook out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would\nhave thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been\nseen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came\nto the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology. Imagine that.\nThis was roughly a quarter century after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four\nyears after the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—brought forth the first commercial Apple\ncomputer. The Chinese public had never seen a Polaroid camera, let alone heard of a computer.\n\n2\n\n\fPolaroid has since gone kaput. China now owns what used to be IBM’s PC business. Today,\nChina produces 93.4 million microcomputers, and it has 600 million domestic cell phone\nsubscribers. The country has become the world’s largest exporter of information technology\ngoods. The Chinese conduct technological espionage so brilliantly that business and government\nleaders in Europe and the U.S. are told that any conversation held anywhere in the world within\nrange of a BlackBerry can be listened to by Chinese agents even if you have it turned off, so long\nas the SIM card and battery are in place.\nWe no longer regard China as a technological backwater. Think back to that opening Olympic\nceremony two Friday nights ago. In 1979, a Polaroid camera stunned the most advanced Chinese\nmilitary pilots. In 2008, the show put on in the Olympic “Bird’s Nest” exhibited an ability to\nharness technology that rivals the most sophisticated weapons or game designer or software\nprogrammer in Silicon Valley.\nWhich brings me to this ancient land’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping\nentered the room for the initial encounter with Blumenthal, he cackled, “Where are these big\nAmerican capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?” During our meeting, he made\na remark that paralleled his famous “black cat, white cat” theme—“it doesn’t matter if the cat is\nwhite or black as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s remarks encapsulated the importance of\npractical results over political correctness and economic development over ideological purity—\nboth hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to our delegation that China was intent on\nmodernization, that the Chinese cat was focused on catching droves of economic mice as it\nengaged the rest of the world, starting with the trade that would be liberated from our settlement\nthat week.\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous\ntariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, they send more than\n$300 billion in goods to the U.S. and hold over $840 billion in U.S. Treasuries and agencies.\nSince Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown their economy at least 10 percent per annum, has\nbecome the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of technology.\nThe Chinese are survivors. During our trip to Beijing in 1979, we were treated to a soiree in the\nGreat Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a\nperformance of Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy No. 6”—by a haggard and emaciated pianist named\nLiu Shikun. Today, Liu is regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide,\nincluding with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music\nalbums of all time. He had given his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of\n10, he had won the Chinese National Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the\nage of 17, he was so brilliant in his performances around the world that the Hungarian\ngovernment presented him with a lock of Liszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius\nwho won innumerable international competitions worldwide.\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that “he has performed in front of\nseveral generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong…Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin\nand Hu Jintao.” What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural\nRevolution and maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell and playing it\nday after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us was one of his\n3\n\n\ffirst public appearances since his “rehabilitation,” and it was so stirring that even our Chinese\nhosts, many of whom had blood on their hands, were moved to tears.\nI thought of Liu when I saw those eight People’s Liberation Army soldiers goose-step their way\nforward with the Olympic flag. They, too, are symbolic of modern China, a nation whose\nthousands of years of history have given us numerous repressive leaders.\nChina occasions an update of Winston Churchill’s famous epigram about Russia: “It is a riddle\nwrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” With China, things are not always what they seem. The\nOlympics have provided us with at least two examples of that. The fireworks in the video of the\nopening ceremonies contained computer-generated images to make the display more vivid. A\ncute-as-a-button 9-year-old girl lip-synched the national anthem being sung by a 7-year-old\nreportedly deemed not attractive enough by a member of the Politburo.\nThese enigmatic efforts to control and to bend reality to conform to image were evident during\nmy 1979 visit to China. The front page of the March 1 edition of the People’s Daily prominently\ndisplayed a photograph of Chairman Hua escorting Secretary Blumenthal, Treasury\nUndersecretary Anthony Solomon and Assistant Secretary of State Jules Katz, with me in tow,\ninto the Great Hall. A discerning viewer would have detected that the shape of our eyes had been\ndoctored by hand into almond-shaped, Chinese-like features.\nThe economic advances that put millions of Chinese in cars are real, as is the technological\nprowess on display in global markets and at the Olympics. The determination of a pianist\npracticing on a makeshift keyboard is real, as is the discipline of the goose-stepping soldiers of\nthe PLA. But here is the message: As we contemplate modern China’s impact on our economy\nand culture and national security, we must work to find the China that lies behind a carefully\ncrafted façade. Churchill concluded his alliterative “riddle, mystery and enigma” line by saying\nthat the key to getting our minds around a perplexing Russia was an understanding of her\nunderlying national interests. In contemplating China, we need to look past carefully crafted\nimages and deepen our understanding of her national interest. Failure to do so will be perilous.\nThank you.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Francisco, California\nMay 28, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fStorms on the Horizon\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Bruce [Ericson]. I am honored to be here this evening and am grateful for the\ninvitation to speak to the Commonwealth Club of California.\nAlan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, two of Ben Bernanke’s linear ancestors as chairmen of the\nFederal Reserve, have been in the news quite a bit lately. Yet, we rarely hear about William\nMcChesney Martin, a magnificent public servant who was Fed chairman during five presidencies\nand to this day holds the record for the longest tenure: 19 years.\nChairman Martin had a way with words. And he had a twinkle in his eye. It was Bill Martin who\nwisely and succinctly defined the Federal Reserve as having the unenviable task “to take away\nthe punchbowl just as the party gets going.” He did himself one up when he received the Alfalfa\nClub’s nomination for the presidency of the United States. I suspect many here tonight have been\nto the annual Alfalfa dinner. It is one of the great institutions in Washington, D.C. Once a year, it\nholds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly\nin cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of\ncourse, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the\nStassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time,\nthen ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group is Veni, Vidi,\nDefici—“I came, I saw, I lost.”\nBill Martin was nominated to run and lose on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966, while serving as\nFed chairman during Lyndon Johnson’s term. In his acceptance speech, 1 he announced that,\ngiven his proclivities as a central banker, he would take his cues from the German philosopher\nGoethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore,\nMartin declared, he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “make\nlife endurable again by stamping out prosperity.”\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully\nconducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that\ncan be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all\ntheir conflicting counsel.”\nIt is true, Bruce, that as you said in your introduction, I am one of the 17 people who participate\nin Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations and provide Ben Bernanke with\n“conflicting counsel” as the committee cobbles together a monetary policy that seeks to promote\nAmerica’s economic prosperity, Goethe to the contrary. But tonight I speak for neither the\ncommittee, nor the chairman, nor any of the other good people that serve the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I speak solely in my own capacity. I want to speak to you tonight about an economic\nproblem that we must soon confront or else risk losing our primacy as the world’s most powerful\nand dynamic economy.\n1\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin, “Alfalfa Club Dinner Script,” delivered at the Alfalfa Club Dinner, Washington, D.C., Jan. 22, 1966, Box 163,\nWilliam McChesney Martin Collection, Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library, Austin, Texas.\n\n1\n\n\fForty-three years ago this Sunday, Bill Martin delivered a commencement address to Columbia\nUniversity that was far more sober than his Alfalfa Club speech. The opening lines of that\nColumbia address 2 were as follows: “When economic prospects are at their brightest, the\ndangers of complacency and recklessness are greatest. As our prosperity proceeds on its recordbreaking path, it behooves every one of us to scan the horizon of our national and international\neconomy for danger signals so as to be ready for any storm.”\nToday, our fellow citizens and financial markets are paying the price for falling victim to the\ncomplacency and recklessness Martin warned against. Few scanned the horizon for trouble\nbrewing as we proceeded along a path of unparalleled prosperity fueled by an unsustainable\nhousing bubble and unbridled credit markets. Armchair or Monday morning quarterbacks will\nlong debate whether the Fed could have/should have/would have taken away the punchbowl that\nlubricated that blowout party. I have given my opinion on that matter elsewhere and won’t go\nnear that subject tonight. What counts now is what we have done more recently and where we go\nfrom here. Whatever the sins of omission or commission committed by our predecessors, the\nBernanke FOMC’s objective is to use a new set of tools to calm the tempest in the credit markets\nto get them back to functioning in a more orderly fashion. We trust that the various term credit\nfacilities we have recently introduced are helping restore confidence while the credit markets\nundertake self-corrective initiatives and lawmakers consider new regulatory schemes.\nI am also not going to engage in a discussion of present monetary policy tonight, except to say\nthat if inflationary developments and, more important, inflation expectations, continue to worsen,\nI would expect a change of course in monetary policy to occur sooner rather than later, even in\nthe face of an anemic economic scenario. Inflation is the most insidious enemy of capitalism. No\ncentral banker can countenance it, not least the men and women of the Federal Reserve.\nTonight, I want to talk about a different matter. In keeping with Bill Martin’s advice, I have been\nscanning the horizon for danger signals even as we continue working to recover from the recent\nturmoil. In the distance, I see a frightful storm brewing in the form of untethered government\ndebt. I choose the words—“frightful storm”—deliberately to avoid hyperbole. Unless we take\nsteps to deal with it, the long-term fiscal situation of the federal government will be\nunimaginably more devastating to our economic prosperity than the subprime debacle and the\nrecent debauching of credit markets that we are now working so hard to correct.\nYou might wonder why a central banker would be concerned with fiscal matters. Fiscal policy is,\nafter all, the responsibility of the Congress, not the Federal Reserve. Congress, and Congress\nalone, has the power to tax and spend. From this monetary policymaker’s point of view, though,\ndeficits matter for what we do at the Fed. There are many reasons why. Economists have found\nthat structural deficits raise long-run interest rates, complicating the Fed’s dual mandate to\ndevelop a monetary policy that promotes sustainable, noninflationary growth. The even more\ndisturbing dark and dirty secret about deficits—especially when they careen out of control—is\nthat they create political pressure on central bankers to adopt looser monetary policy down the\n2\n\n“Does Monetary History Repeat Itself?” Commencement Day Luncheon of the Alumni Federation of Columbia University, June 1, 1965, New\nYork City.\n\n2\n\n\froad. I will return to that shortly. First, let me give you the unvarnished facts of our nation’s\nfiscal predicament.\nEight years ago, our federal budget, crafted by a Democratic president and enacted by a\nRepublican Congress, produced a fiscal surplus of $236 billion, the first surplus in almost 40\nyears and the highest nominal-dollar surplus in American history. While the Fed is scrupulously\nnonpartisan and nonpolitical, I mention this to emphasize that the deficit/debt issue knows no\nparty and can be solved only by both parties working together. For a brief time, with surpluses\nprojected into the future as far as the eye could see, economists and policymakers alike began to\ncontemplate a bucolic future in which interest payments would form an ever-declining share of\nfederal outlays, a future where Treasury bonds and debt-ceiling legislation would become dusty\nrelics of a long-forgotten past. The Fed even had concerns about how open market operations\nwould be conducted in a marketplace short of Treasury debt.\nThat utopian scenario did not last for long. Over the next seven years, federal spending grew at a\n6.2 percent nominal annual rate while receipts grew at only 3.5 percent. Of course, certain areas\nof government, like national defense, had to spend more in the wake of 9/11. But nondefense\ndiscretionary spending actually rose 6.4 percent annually during this timeframe, outpacing the\ngrowth in total expenditures. Deficits soon returned, reaching an expected $410 billion for\n2008—a $600 billion swing from where we were just eight years ago. This $410 billion estimate,\nby the way, was made before the recently passed farm bill and supplemental defense\nappropriation and without considering a proposed patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax—all\nmeasures that will lead to a further ballooning of government deficits.\nIn keeping with the tradition of rosy scenarios, official budget projections suggest this deficit\nwill be relatively short-lived. They almost always do. According to the official calculus,\nfollowing a second $400-billion-plus deficit in 2009, the red ink should fall to $160 billion in\n2010 and $95 billion in 2011, and then the budget swings to a $48 billion surplus in 2012.\nIf you do the math, however, you might be forgiven for sensing that these felicitous projections\nlook a tad dodgy. To reach the projected 2012 surplus, outlays are assumed to rise at a 2.4\npercent nominal annual rate over the next four years—less than half as fast as they rose the\nprevious seven years. Revenue is assumed to rise at a 6.7 percent nominal annual rate over the\nnext four years—almost double the rate of the past seven years. Using spending and revenue\ngrowth rates that have actually prevailed in recent years, the 2012 surplus quickly evaporates and\nbecomes a deficit, potentially of several hundred billion dollars.\nDoing deficit math is always a sobering exercise. It becomes an outright painful one when you\napply your calculator to the long-run fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs. Were I not\na taciturn central banker, I would say the mathematics of the long-term outlook for entitlements,\nleft unchanged, is nothing short of catastrophic.\nTypically, critics ranging from the Concord Coalition to Ross Perot begin by wringing their\ncollective hands over the unfunded liabilities of Social Security. A little history gives you a view\nas to why. Franklin Roosevelt originally conceived a social security system in which individuals\nwould fund their own retirements through payroll-tax contributions. But Congress quickly\nrealized that such a system could not put much money into the pockets of indigent elderly\n3\n\n\fcitizens ravaged by the Great Depression. Instead, a pay-as-you-go funding system was\nembraced, making each generation’s retirement the responsibility of its children.\nNow, fast forward 70 or so years and ask this question: What is the mathematical predicament of\nSocial Security today? Answer: The amount of money the Social Security system would need\ntoday to cover all unfunded liabilities from now on—what fiscal economists call the “infinite\nhorizon discounted value” of what has already been promised recipients but has no funding\nmechanism currently in place—is $13.6 trillion, an amount slightly less than the annual gross\ndomestic product of the United States.\nDemographics explain why this is so. Birthrates have fallen dramatically, reducing the worker–\nretiree ratio and leaving today’s workers pulling a bigger load than the system designers ever\nenvisioned. Life spans have lengthened without a corresponding increase in the retirement age,\nleaving retirees in a position to receive benefits far longer than the system designers envisioned.\nFormulae for benefits and cost-of-living adjustments have also contributed to the growth in\nunfunded liabilities.\nThe good news is this Social Security shortfall might be manageable. While the issues regarding\nSocial Security reform are complex, it is at least possible to imagine how Congress might find,\nwithin a $14 trillion economy, ways to wrestle with a $13 trillion unfunded liability. The bad\nnews is that Social Security is the lesser of our entitlement worries. It is but the tip of the\nunfunded liability iceberg. The much bigger concern is Medicare, a program established in 1965,\nthe same prosperous year that Bill Martin cautioned his Columbia University audience to be\nwary of complacency and storms on the horizon.\nMedicare was a pay-as-you-go program from the very beginning, despite warnings from some\ncongressional leaders—Wilbur Mills was the most credible of them before he succumbed to the\npay-as-you-go wiles of Fanne Foxe, the Argentine Firecracker—who foresaw some of the longterm fiscal issues such a financing system could pose. Unfortunately, they were right.\nPlease sit tight while I walk you through the math of Medicare. As you may know, the program\ncomes in three parts: Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays; Medicare B, which covers\ndoctor visits; and Medicare D, the drug benefit that went into effect just 29 months ago. The\ninfinite-horizon present discounted value of the unfunded liability for Medicare A is $34.4\ntrillion. The unfunded liability of Medicare B is an additional $34 trillion. The shortfall for\nMedicare D adds another $17.2 trillion. The total? If you wanted to cover the unfunded liability\nof all three programs today, you would be stuck with an $85.6 trillion bill. That is more than six\ntimes as large as the bill for Social Security. It is more than six times the annual output of the\nentire U.S. economy.\nWhy is the Medicare figure so large? There is a mix of reasons, really. In part, it is due to the\nsame birthrate and life-expectancy issues that affect Social Security. In part, it is due to evercostlier advances in medical technology and the willingness of Medicare to pay for them. And in\npart, it is due to expanded benefits—the new drug benefit program’s unfunded liability is by\nitself one-third greater than all of Social Security’s.\n\n4\n\n\fAdd together the unfunded liabilities from Medicare and Social Security, and it comes to $99.2\ntrillion over the infinite horizon. Traditional Medicare composes about 69 percent, the new drug\nbenefit roughly 17 percent and Social Security the remaining 14 percent.\nI want to remind you that I am only talking about the unfunded portions of Social Security and\nMedicare. It is what the current payment scheme of Social Security payroll taxes, Medicare\npayroll taxes, membership fees for Medicare B, copays, deductibles and all other revenue\ncurrently channeled to our entitlement system will not cover under current rules. These existing\nrevenue streams must remain in place in perpetuity to handle the “funded” entitlement liabilities.\nReduce or eliminate this income and the unfunded liability grows. Increase benefits and the\nliability grows as well.\nLet’s say you and I and Bruce Ericson and every U.S. citizen who is alive today decided to fully\naddress this unfunded liability through lump-sum payments from our own pocketbooks, so that\nall of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would\nreceive promised benefits in perpetuity. How much would we have to pay if we split the tab?\nAgain, the math is painful. With a total population of 304 million, from infants to the elderly, the\nper-person payment to the federal treasury would come to $330,000. This comes to $1.3 million\nper family of four—over 25 times the average household’s income.\nClearly, once-and-for-all contributions would be an unbearable burden. Alternatively, we could\naddress the entitlement shortfall through policy changes that would affect ourselves and future\ngenerations. For example, a permanent 68 percent increase in federal income tax revenue—from\nindividual and corporate taxpayers—would suffice to fully fund our entitlement programs. Or we\ncould instead divert 68 percent of current income-tax revenues from their intended uses to the\nentitlement system, which would accomplish the same thing.\nSuppose we decided to tackle the issue solely on the spending side. It turns out that total\ndiscretionary spending in the federal budget, if maintained at its current share of GDP in\nperpetuity, is 3 percent larger than the entitlement shortfall. So all we would have to do to fully\nfund our nation’s entitlement programs would be to cut discretionary spending by 97 percent.\nBut hold on. That discretionary spending includes defense and national security, education, the\nenvironment and many other areas, not just those controversial earmarks that make the evening\nnews. All of them would have to be cut—almost eliminated, really—to tackle this problem\nthrough discretionary spending.\nI hope that gives you some idea of just how large the problem is. And just to drive an important\npoint home, these spending cuts or tax increases would need to be made immediately and\nmaintained in perpetuity to solve the entitlement deficit problem. Discretionary spending would\nhave to be reduced by 97 percent not only for our generation, but for our children and their\nchildren and every generation of children to come. And similarly on the taxation side, income tax\nrevenue would have to rise 68 percent and remain that high forever. Remember, though, I said\ntax revenue, not tax rates. Who knows how much individual and corporate tax rates would have\nto change to increase revenue by 68 percent?\nIf these possible solutions to the unfunded-liability problem seem draconian, it’s because they\nare draconian. But they do serve to give you a sense of the severity of the problem. To be sure,\nthere are ways to lessen the reliance on any single policy and the burden borne by any particular\n5\n\n\fset of citizens. Most proposals to address long-term entitlement debt, for example, rely on a\ncombination of tax increases, benefit reductions and eligibility changes to find the trillions\nnecessary to safeguard the system over the long term.\nNo combination of tax hikes and spending cuts, though, will change the total burden borne by\ncurrent and future generations. For the existing unfunded liabilities to be covered in the end,\nsomeone must pay $99.2 trillion more or receive $99.2 trillion less than they have been currently\npromised. This is a cold, hard fact. The decision we must make is whether to shoulder a\nsubstantial portion of that burden today or compel future generations to bear its full weight.\nNow that you are all thoroughly depressed, let me come back to monetary policy and the Fed.\nIt is only natural to cast about for a solution—any solution—to avoid the fiscal pain we know is\nnecessary because we succumbed to complacency and put off dealing with this looming fiscal\ndisaster. Throughout history, many nations, when confronted by sizable debts they were unable\nor unwilling to repay, have seized upon an apparently painless solution to this dilemma:\nmonetization. Just have the monetary authority run cash off the printing presses until the debt is\nrepaid, the story goes, then promise to be responsible from that point on and hope your sins will\nbe forgiven by God and Milton Friedman and everyone else.\nWe know from centuries of evidence in countless economies, from ancient Rome to today’s\nZimbabwe, that running the printing press to pay off today’s bills leads to much worse problems\nlater on. The inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far\nworse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid.\nEarlier I mentioned the Fed’s dual mandate to manage growth and inflation. In the long run,\ngrowth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation. Stable prices go hand in hand\nwith achieving sustainable economic growth. I have said many, many times that inflation is a\nsinister beast that, if uncaged, devours savings, erodes consumers’ purchasing power, decimates\nreturns on capital, undermines the reliability of financial accounting, distracts the attention of\ncorporate management, undercuts employment growth and real wages, and debases the currency.\nPurging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine. We\nhave been there, and we know the cure that was wrought by the FOMC under Paul Volcker.\nEven the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy to accommodate fiscal\nburdens, should it take root, is a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy.\nThe Federal Reserve will never let this happen. It is not an option. Ever. Period.\nThe way we resolve these liabilities—and resolve them we must—will affect our own well-being\nas well as the prospects of future generations and the global economy. Failing to face up to our\nresponsibility will produce the mother of all financial storms. The warning signals have been\nflashing for years, but we find it easier to ignore them than to take action. Will we take the\npainful fiscal steps necessary to prevent the storm by reducing and eventually eliminating our\nfiscal imbalances? That depends on you.\nI mean “you” literally. This situation is of your own creation. When you berate your\nrepresentatives or senators or presidents for the mess we are in, you are really berating yourself.\n6\n\n\fYou elect them. You are the ones who let them get away with burdening your children and\ngrandchildren rather than yourselves with the bill for your entitlement programs.\nThis issue transcends political affiliation. When George Shultz, one of San Francisco’s greatest\nRepublican public servants, was director of President Nixon’s Office of Management and\nBudget, he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend. After\nsome nights of tossing and turning, he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office. Cohen\nhad a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history. “Sam,”\nShultz asked, “tell me something just between you and me. Is there any difference between\nRepublicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen looked at him, furrowed\nhis brow and, after thinking about it, replied, “Mr. Shultz, there is only one difference:\nDemocrats enjoy it more.”\nYet no one, Democrat or Republican, enjoys placing our children and grandchildren and their\nchildren and grandchildren in harm’s way. No one wants to see the frightful storm of unfunded\nlong-term liabilities destroy our economy or threaten the independence and authority of our\ncentral bank or tear our currency asunder.\nOf late, we have heard many complaints about the weakness of the dollar against the euro and\nother currencies. It was recently argued in the op-ed pages of the Financial Times 3 that one\nreason for the demise of the British pound was the need to liquidate England’s international\nreserves to pay off the costs of the Great Wars. In the end, the pound, it was essentially argued,\nwas sunk by the kaiser’s army and Hitler’s bombs. Right now, we—you and I—are launching\nfiscal bombs against ourselves. You have it in your power as the electors of our fiscal authorities\nto prevent this destruction. Please do so.\n\n3\n\n“The Euro’s Success Could Also Be Its Downfall,” by Harold James, Financial Times, May 18, 2008.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSt. Petersburg, Florida\nMay 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fLabor Omnia Vincit\n(Labor Conquers All Things)\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Chairman [George] Michel. It is an honor to address the Class of ’08 here in this\nbeautiful Garden Theatre. Right off the bat, Capt. [Robert J.] Fine, I want to congratulate you\nand your staff and the students for the honor you continue to bring to David Glasgow Farragut’s\ngood name. I understand that six of this afternoon’s graduates received service academy\nappointments, another 12 received Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) scholarships and\n100 percent of the class is college bound. That is heady stuff. The hero of the Battle of Mobile\nBay would be proud.\nI want the Class of 2008 to stand up. Now turn around. Look at all these people who have come\nto celebrate your success. These are your parents, your brothers and sisters, your other relatives\nand your friends and teachers. They have been at your side through joyful moments and less\njoyful ones. They have for some 18 years encouraged you and pushed you. They have believed\nin you. And now they are here to celebrate with you your admission to the society of educated\nmen and women.\nJust as your admirers will soon applaud you, I want you to take this opportunity to applaud them.\nThank them for their love and support.\nMr. Chairman, your introduction brought back some precious memories and reminded me of the\nlong distance I have traversed since the summer of 1963, when I showed up on the banks of\nToms River on the North Campus in New Jersey, a skinny little 14-year-old, both afraid and\nexcited about the adventure that lay ahead. I was lucky to be taught by people you mentioned,\ndedicated educators like Vernie Romefeld and Stan Darby, God rest their souls, and others I hold\ndear to this day 40-odd years later. I was lucky to be coached by Stan Slaby, who badgered and\ncoerced me to excel on the playing fields, toughening me up for the challenges of life in a\nsometimes relentlessly competitive world.\nBest of all, I was lucky to have made lifelong friends there. I am delighted to see Ed DeSeta here\ntoday. He was our battalion commander, just as his son Alex would be 35 years later—the first\nfather–son battalion commander legacy in the academy’s history. For an entire academic year, I\nstood right behind Ed three times a day in parade formation as his “exec” as we drew swords,\ntook reports and marched into meals. To this day, I remember the back of his head! I am glad to\nsee it remains as noble now as it was then.\nThree other classmates are here today as well. My roommate Alex Garcias, who came from Cuba\nand zipped through Farragut’s academics like gee whiz, graduated as class vice president and as\ncommander of the First Company and went on to Vanderbilt University and a prestigious career\nas a urologist. Russ Phillips, who hailed from the small town of Finksburg, Md., and used his\nprodigious brain to win the Headmaster’s and English awards our junior year and his ample\nmuscle to play fullback on the football team, became First Company lieutenant junior grade, then\n1\n\n\fwent on to Duke and a stellar career in financial services. Robert Jauernig, a Californian who\nbecame Second Company commander, had a mind that was so quick and dynamic that we\nnicknamed him “IBM.” After Farragut, he darted off to Rensselaer Polytechnic on an ROTC\nscholarship and then on to direct the U.S. Navy’s electronic and logistical warfare needs in the\nfirst Gulf War before becoming a big deal in the New York banking community.\nLast night, Alex and Russ and Bob and I did what middle-aged men do when they gather to\nreminisce: We ate good food, drank a little wine, told lies about the women who swore they\nloved us, and recalled old friends from Admiral Farragut Academy. Most important of all, we\ndiscussed what I might say to you today.\nThe standard reflex of a commencement speaker is to troll through Bartlett’s or the Oxford\nDictionary of Quotations or Wikipedia to find something wise that puts the nobility of education\nin a glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay as a collection of other\npeople’s thoughts disguised to look like your own. Commencement speeches are no different.\nHoping to find something profound I might pinch and adapt to inspire you today, I wandered\nthrough abridged versions of the great minds of the ages: Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St.\nAugustine, Voltaire, Muhammed, Martin Luther … Mae West, Jessica Simpson, Miley Cyrus.\nAlas, I found nothing that I could be certain you had not heard many times before. So I turned to\nmy three classmates.\nThey reminded me that at Farragut in the 1960s, no doubt much like it was for Chairman Michel\nin the Class of ’49, we had drilled into us those maxims that define leadership. Our favorites\ncame from the lips of heroes past:\nJohn Paul Jones, the “Father of the Navy,” described a leader as “a gentleman of liberal\neducation, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor.”\nThe immortal Winston Churchill said: “Never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing,\ngreat or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense.\nNever yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”\nRobert E. Lee said, “Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one.”\nAnd Gen. George Patton wisely advised that a leader should “Never”—these Great Men sure like\nto use the word “never”—“tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will\nsurprise you with their ingenuity.”\nAfter a wee bit too much cabernet, Russ Phillips came up with this, which is thought to be from\nGen. Norman Schwarzkopf: “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without\nyour accordion.” (I’ll have to use my leadership skills and tell Russ to surprise everyone with his\ningenuity by sticking to his current successful career and not turn to speechwriting).\nEvery commencement speaker at every school and university, including Gen. Schwarzkopf, will\ndispense pretty much the same advice over the next few weeks of commencements: Be\ndisciplined; be prepared; be loyal, brave and thrifty; don’t waste your talents; take risks; push the\nenvelope; respect your fellow men and women; serve others; never compromise your integrity;\n2\n\n\fto thine own self be true and be true to community and country; give back when others have\ngiven to you; promise no more than you can deliver; stick to your obligations; never—there it is\nagain—never forget you have talent to do good; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of\nexcellence.\nGreat words of wisdom can inspire us. And yet they do not determine who we are or what we\nmight become. Character comes from our upbringing and our experiences—and it is on this very\npersonal level that I want to address the seniors who will soon walk out of Admiral Farragut\nAcademy with diploma in hand.\nI have been in your shoes. At 14, I was shipped off to Farragut North. It was, frankly, a tough\nand unforgiving place. Trust me: It had nothing as pretty as this Garden Theatre in this sunny\nenclave of St. Petersburg. When the wind howled off of Toms River in wintertime, it felt colder\nthan the dark side of Pluto. Capt. Fine’s counterpart, our headmaster, was named Raven O.\nDodge. He was a stern man. He had one arm. We lived in fear of him. But we respected him,\neven if the boyish wits on the swim team called him “Sidestroke” behind his back.\nWe rose at 6:15 every morning, mustered out to the parade field for inspection and marched to\nbreakfast in formation. We had morning classes and then formed up and marched to lunch with\nour drum and bugle corps. After lunch came more classes, then activities and sports at 3:30. And\nthen, for the last time of the day, we formed up and marched to dinner at 6. We went straight to\nour rooms after dinner to do homework before lights-out at 10. On weekends, we had full-dress\nparades. We learned how to handle weapons and, being at a naval academy prep school, how to\ntie knots and navigate by the stars.\nIn those days, Farragut was an all-male school. My buddies back home thought I was nuts. They\nwere with their families, dating good-looking girls, driving cars, spending money, having fun,\nsleeping late and doing things in their own sweet time. I was in New Jersey for four years,\nmarching to meals, studying hard, leading a highly disciplined life and getting by on a $2-a-week\nallowance. We got $5 a week as seniors, but it didn’t make a whole lot of difference because we\nonly got out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. My life and my friends’ lives were as different\nas night and day. Sound familiar?\nAnd yet, I wouldn’t go back and change any of it—even with the hindsight gained in the 45\nyears since I showed up on the doorstep of Farragut Hall. I wouldn’t change any of it because the\nlessons I learned in those four years made it possible for me to accomplish all those things that\nGeorge Michel bragged on earlier. We learned to internalize—to come by as instinct—all those\nattributes mentioned so eloquently in those great leaders’ words I cited earlier. We learned the\nvalues of punctilious courtesy, sticking to conviction, never wronging a friend or bowing to\noverwhelming odds. We learned that semper fidelis—being always faithful to your country, your\nmission and your own potential—is reward in and of itself.\nWe also learned a lesson that is quintessentially unique to naval academy prep schools. When\nyou wear a uniform and you live in the same dorms and eat the same food in the same place,\nnobody cares whether you are rich or poor or where you or your parents come from. I was the\nson of immigrants. My father never got past fourth grade; my mother was a secretary. Alex\nGarcias was a Cuban immigrant whose mother survived by waiting tables when she first landed\non our shores. Bob Jauernig was an Army brat. Russ Phillips was a country boy from Finksburg.\n3\n\n\fWe were at school with a lot of rich boys from Manhattan and other tony places who had fancier\nbloodlines, but it didn’t make a bit of difference. You moved up in rank according to your effort\nand achievement. You got what you earned and you earned what you got.\nI can’t tell you how many times people now ask me: Just how did you get to Annapolis and to\nHarvard and all those fancy schools? How did you end up on Wall Street, make money, become\nan ambassador and do all those high-sounding things in Washington? How did you end up\nworking with Henry Kissinger? And how did you end up sitting at the table with Alan Greenspan\nand Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve? What’s your secret?\nAn honest answer requires the ultimate disclaimer that it helps to have good luck on your side—\nserendipity comes in mighty handy. I have had way more than my share of it. But I believe that\nthe lessons and disciplines learned at Farragut, just like those you have learned, are what allowed\nme to make the most of that good luck.\nAs to the secret, you can forget all those quotes from musty, dusty men of the past. I’m going to\ngive it straight to you from the ultimate source: Oprah Winfrey. As accomplished an American\nas you will ever find, she says it best: “The big secret in life is that there is no big secret.\nWhatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work.”\nThat hits the nail on the head. You need to dream of big things. But dreaming will not suffice. To\nsucceed, you must work. If you are willing to work hard, you will achieve your goals. That is all\nyou need to remember of this graduation speech. That, and the sound advice that you should\nnever, never, never, never … go deer hunting with an accordion.\n\n4\n\n\f"

            "content": "Selling Our Services to the World\n(With an Ode to Chicago)\nRemarks before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nChicago\nApril 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fSelling Our Services to the World\n(With an Ode to Chicago)\nBy Richard W. Fisher\nThank you, Charlie [Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]. And\nthank you, Mike Moskow for inviting me to speak to the Chicago Council. We miss you, Mike.\nFor 13 years you brought not only wisdom but élan to that big mahogany table at the Fed, and\nnone of us can quite fill that gap. The measure of a successful leader, however, is who he picks\nas his replacement, and with Charlie, you hit a home run.\nI especially appreciate Charlie’s mentioning my modest book collection. Part of that collection\nconsists of documents and writings of British prime ministers. One of my favorites is Gladstone.\nHe used to say that “only love has made more fools of men than contemplating the nature of\nmoney.” Yet, that is precisely what Charlie Evans and I and Ben Bernanke and our colleagues at\nthe Federal Reserve do: We spend practically every waking hour contemplating the nature of\nmoney and the proper shape and conduct of our monetary system. So if you detect an air of\ndistraction in Charlie Evans now and then, be kind. He has not gone mad or foolish on us; he is\njust hard at work noodling through our predicament and conjuring up Chicago’s\nrecommendations on what we at the Federal Open Market Committee should do.\nLast week in San Antonio, I provided my perspective on the situation we now encounter in a\nmarketplace entering the early stages of recovery from a period of excess, indiscriminate\nbehavior and historical (and occasionally hysterical) amnesia, and on the efforts we at the\nFederal Reserve are making to calmly and prudently restore the efficacy of the financial markets.\nI said then—and I assert again today—that there is nothing “unprecedented” about the situation\nwe find ourselves in. To illustrate the point, I want to read a passage from Washington Irving’s\n1819 essay on the Mississippi Bubble.1 For those of you who think the recent housing bubble\nand the ensuing financial imbroglio are “unprecedented,” listen to these words penned almost\n200 years ago:\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when\nthe ‘credit system’…expands to full luxuriance: everybody trusts everybody; a\nbad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies\nplain and open…. Banks…become so many mints to coin words into cash; and as\nthe supply of words is inexhaustible, it may readily be supposed what a vast\namount of promissory capital is soon in circulation…. Nothing is heard but\ngigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and\nimmense sums made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but\nthe believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital….\n“Now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men. They relate their\ndreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, [and] dazzle them with golden\nvisions…. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on\nspeculation; bubble rises on bubble…. No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of\nattention, that does not double or treble the investment…. Could this delusion\n1\n\n\falways last, the life of a merchant would indeed be a golden dream; but it is as\nshort as it is brilliant.”\nAnd to think, Washington Irving had never met a subprime mortgage, or a CDO, a CLO, an SIV\nor a credit default swap! It is indeed true that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat\nit. That is the bad news. Financiers, “dazzle[ing] the credulous,” including regulators, repeated\nhistory in spades, despite their claim to unprecedentedly clever and new risk-management tools\nand mathematical sophistication. It was as short as it was momentarily “brilliant.” But that is\ndone, and now we must do what we can to remedy the situation. One thing, however, is clear.\nThe answer, to be curt, is not to compound the bad by repeating the oft-prescribed remedy of\ninflating our way out of our predicament with a wing-and-a-prayer promise that it can always be\nreined in later. It is for this reason that I have maintained a strong reluctance to further general\nmonetary accommodation. At the same time, I have been an advocate of using our various\ndiscount window facilities, within reason, to bridge the financial system’s structural problems as\nthe credit markets correct themselves and run the long course of contrition.\nEnough of that pleasantry. That is not what I came to speak about today. I don’t know about you,\nbut I am weary of the woeful stuff that is constantly blaring from our newspapers and television\nsets and the Net, compounded as it is in the throes of a presidential election. Today, I would like\nto talk about something more uplifting—about the good news documented in another of my\nfavorite books, the Dallas Fed’s annual report, which we have placed on each of your chairs and\nwill be releasing to the public after this luncheon.\nI hail from one of those growing, prosperous Sunbelt cities that has burst forth as a center of U.S.\neconomic growth in the past generation or two. Dallas is now the hub of the nation’s sixth largest\nmetropolitan area, which joins the fifth largest metropolitan area in Houston and the ninth largest\nin the San Antonio–Austin region to form the economic backbone of a thriving state powered by\nthe gumption of 24 million hard-working, hardscrabble souls. To be sure, our economy is\nlubricated by a robust energy industry. But it percolates on technology and information. I believe\nthat my hometown of Dallas can serve as a microcosm for our nation’s tectonic shift from\nproducing goods to producing services.\nBy Chicago standards, we Texans may be nouveau riche. But as my father used to say, “It is\nbetter to be nouveaux riche than not riche at all.” Lest you forget, back at the end of the 19th\ncentury, when Dallas and Houston and San Antonio and Austin were just a twinkle in our\nancestors’ eyes, Chicago was considered equally nouveaux and brash by the folks in New York.\nIt was that brashness that transformed Chicago from what Carl Sandburg described as “hog\nbutcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of wheat, player with railroads and the nation’s freight\nhandler” into one of the great cities and a cutting- edge center of finance- and information-based\nprogress. You have repeatedly used your riches to evolve your economy, setting an example not\njust for Dallas but for all of America.\nWith each passing year, the U.S. economy relies less on the production of agricultural and\nfactory goods and more on services to fulfill the American Dream. Today, four-fifths of our jobs\nare in services, a sprawling and diverse sector that includes janitors and cashiers and fast-food\ncooks, as well as bank presidents and college professors, software “geeks,” architects and\nfilmmakers, chemical engineers and bioengineers, doctors and their nemeses, lawyers. Imagine\nthis: In 2005, there were more or less the same number of people employed in the legal services\n2\n\n\fprofession as there were in the auto manufacturing sector, yet lawyers contributed twice as much\nof the value added to our GDP as the automobile manufacturers. We are a service-sector-driven\neconomy, plain and simple.\nIn 1950, the height of America’s Industrial Age, Chicago had 42 percent of its workforce in\nmanufacturing, mining and construction, a share significantly above the rest of the country.\nToday, industry as we knew it then accounts for just 17 percent of the Windy City’s job base, a\nnumber below the national average. The remaining 83 percent are in services, putting the city\nslightly above the national average.\nWith this remarkable shift from industry to services, Chicago’s economy has continued to grow,\non net adding nearly 400,000 jobs in the past quarter century. A great many of them are highpaying service-sector positions, putting Chicago 11th among the nation’s 280 metropolitan areas\nin household income. That’s in the top 4 percent.\nThe more adaptable cities are—the more able and willing to remake their economies as times\nchange—the better they do. In his 1916 poem, Sandburg portrayed the raw energy of an\nemerging industrial giant that was constantly building, breaking up and rebuilding. The\neconomic way of life that defined that era of furious industrial activity may be ebbing or even\nlost to new industrial sites in China or Eastern Europe, but the fierce desire to keep moving\nforward has survived and, with it, Chicago’s claim to being a vibrant, top-ranking world city.\nOld Chicago, perhaps better than young Dallas or the other new cities of the Sunbelt, provides a\nperfect template for success in today’s era of globalization. The United States, like Chicago, can\ncontinue to prosper only if it faces economic change head-on, choosing to compete rather than\nretreat, seeking out new opportunities in a globalizing economy, where goods, services, money\nand ideas flow freely across international borders.\nOne of these opportunities—maybe the best one—lies in exporting services. The Dallas Fed\nexplores this subject in its keynote essay in this year’s annual report, titled “Opportunity Knocks:\nSelling Our Services to the World.”2 I urge each of you to read it. Apart from making you feel a\nbit better about this country’s economic future in a globalized and highly competitive world, it\nmight give you some insight into which service industries are likely to outperform others as\nglobal demand expands, and why.\nLet me take you inside our report, starting with a look into the typical buying patterns of\nconsumers—be they Americans, Chinese or South Africans. Data from nearly all parts of the\nworld show us that consumers tend to spend relatively less on goods and more on services as\ntheir incomes rise. You might think of a shopping list. At the top of it are life’s necessities, led\nby the traditional triumvirate of food, clothing and shelter, followed by all sorts of household\nitems, from knives and forks to furniture and appliances, and so on. These are largely goods.\nOnce people have met their basic needs, they tend to want medical care, transportation and\ncommunication, information, recreation, entertainment, financial and legal advice, and the like.\nIn short, with increasing prosperity, consumers shift to spending a higher percentage of their\nmoney on services. Many services, of course, are customized and delivered directly to clients;\nthey are largely knowledge and information. In the Internet age, this intellectual output can be\ncarved up into bits and bytes and sent nearly anywhere on this planet in a few seconds for a few\npennies.\n3\n\n\fIn the United States, we shifted our buying from goods to services as we grew richer. Other rich\ncountries have done the same. There is no reason to believe that the next group of countries\nclimbing the income ladder will behave any differently. That brings us to China and India, two\npopulous nations that in the past decade have stirred from a long slumber and taken off on fastgrowth paths. As they’ve opened up to the rest of the world, 2.5 billion consumers have been\nadded to the world economy.\nMany commentators portray the emergence of China and India as a threat. We hear about a flood\nof Chinese manufactured goods costing U.S. factory jobs. We hear about the outsourcing of jobs\nto India eroding U.S. service industries. These are actual phenomena. But it is also true—and this\nwe rarely hear about—that these and other emerging countries are not just selling to world\nmarkets, they are buying from them, too. Imports as a share of China’s economy more than\ndoubled in the past decade to 33 percent. India’s import share has tripled to 23 percent.\nTo a Dallasite or a Chicagoan, that is the sound of opportunity knocking. Let me give you a few\nexamples. At forecasted growth rates, we calculate that China will add $116 billion to world\ndemand for medical care in just one year. India will contribute an additional $25 billion.\nTogether, the incremental demand for medical care from just these two markets will be more\nthan four times larger than the contribution from the U.S. Turning to global spending on\nrecreational services, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion from China and $16 billion\nfrom India, compared with $23 billion from the U.S. Down the line, these gains should be even\nbigger, provided China and India continue to grow their economies.\nNow throw in all the services beyond medical care and recreation. Then consider the world\nbeyond China and India, a mix of emerging nations and traditional markets, most seeing their\nincomes rise. This is new business. Their domestic producers will meet a good chunk of the\nadded demand, but China, India and other countries will shop the globe for what they cannot find\nat home or what is better elsewhere. Here, we have advantages in many areas. Medicine, finance,\neducation, legal services, forensics, architecture and design, engineering technology, film and\nother aspects of entertainment—in these service areas and more, America is second to none.\nTo be sure, we must compete with the Brits, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Aussies and\neveryone else for this business. But U.S. firms have already proven to be stellar at selling their\nservices to the world. We already export more services than any other nation—by a long shot.\nOur foreign sales of nearly $500 billion in 2007 exceeded the combined total of the next two\nservices exporters, Britain and Germany. Better still, most of what we sell abroad are highly\nvalued services—and the numbers prove it.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis divvies up services exports into 20 categories. In three-fourths\nof them, U.S. exports exceed imports. Our edge is nearly 24 to 1 in industrial engineering, which\nincludes American technicians who install computerized control systems, design industrial\nrobots and streamline supply chains. Marquees all over the world tout our movies, and we have a\n13-to-1 trade ratio in the distribution of films and television shows. We are crackerjack suppliers\nof construction services, information management, legal and financial services, and education.\nBecause of our deep reservoir of copyrights and patents, what we receive from foreigners in\nlicensing fees and royalties exceeds what we pay to other countries by better than 2 to 1.\n4\n\n\fAll told, our service exports exceed imports in 15 of 20 categories. In 10 categories, our service\nexports are more than double our imports—some exceeding even 10 times as much, such as\nmedical services, TV and film, and industrial engineering. In only two service categories are our\nimports more than double our exports—freight and insurance.\nThe United States developed its services prowess here at home. Our companies learned how to\ndeliver services efficiently and effectively by meeting the needs of a highly sophisticated,\nevolving domestic economy. To fill the ranks of these companies, our colleges and universities\neducated doctors, lawyers, architects and managers. The next logical step has always been to sell\nthis expertise to foreign customers.\nWe should not overlook the revolution in communications and information technology that has\nspread around the world in the past two decades, a revolution that was conceived and delivered\nand nurtured to maturity in the laboratories and universities of the United States. The economics\ntextbooks I had in college told me it was far easier to export goods than services. Physical things\ncould be mass produced, crated, put on ships, warehoused and sold abroad. Most services, in\ncontrast, had to be delivered directly to clients. They faced obstacles in export markets largely\nbecause of technological limitations and the high costs involved with communications, travel and\ninformation transmittal.\nThese barriers to services trade have been crumbling. The story goes back to the late 1960s, with\nthe Defense Department’s project for decentralizing communications, which a few decades later\ngrew into the Internet we know today. In the mid-1970s, the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—\nsold their first Apple I, the first step toward the desktops and laptops that keep today’s businesses\nhumming. Information Age technology expands the range of services that can be delivered over\ngreat distances. It makes it cheaper and easier to find and interact with customers overseas.\nThe upshot is changing trading patterns. The growth rate for U.S. exports was faster for goods\nthan services until the early 1980s. Then, foreign sales of services began rising faster than goods.\nSince 1985, our services exports have grown nearly 260 percent, eclipsing the 200 percent\ngrowth in goods exports. Today, services represent nearly 30 percent of our overseas sales.\nWe can expect our trade to continue its transition from goods to services. I assure you this is\nindeed good news, particularly welcome at a time of widespread anxiety about creating good\njobs and maintaining high and growing median income levels. Exporting more services will help\nus do both.\nToo often, services get a bad rap. The hamburger-flipper stereotype of services jobs would have\nus believe that they are innately and unalterably inferior to goods-producing jobs. That simply is\nnot true. Yes, there are low-paying jobs in services, just as there are low-paying ones in goods,\nbut the average services worker today makes more than the average factory worker. If we look\nback to 1990, we see that hourly wages have grown faster in services than manufacturing for all\nservice categories except transportation and warehousing.\nAverage manufacturing earnings stood at $16.40 an hour in 2007, excluding overtime. Finance,\ninsurance and real estate workers earned $19.66 an hour. Professional and business services were\nat $20.14 an hour and information services at $23.92 an hour. Utilities paid their workers $27.93.\nOnly retail trade and leisure and hospitality paid significantly less than manufacturing in 2007—\n5\n\n\fand these are industries that for the most part don’t require advanced skills and employ large\nnumbers of students and many young people just starting their careers.\nProductivity determines pay. And America’s services workers are among the world’s most\nproductive, with an average worker’s output at $80,000. U.S. services providers are productive\nbecause they’re well educated and highly skilled. The capital of our times is human, not\nmechanical. Yesterday’s factory workers brought strong backs, steady eyes and sure hands to the\nproduction process, while the capitalist provided the buildings and machinery. Today’s service\ncompanies may provide office space and computers, but the workers create value with their\nminds. The engine of the knowledge economy can be found not in sooty factories but atop our\nnecks: It is the human brain. This is particularly true of the services we export, which skew\ntoward the highly sophisticated output of well-educated and skilled workers.\nEconomic theory tells us that nations will export what can be produced by factors they have in\nrelative abundance. This is the principle of comparative advantage. Countries with significant\nmineral wealth will sell oil or copper. Those with large tracts of fertile land will sell wheat, corn\nor beef. Those with cheap labor and large stocks of machinery—think China—will sell run-ofthe-mill factory goods. America’s highly knowledgeable and experienced services workers are\nour nation’s relatively abundant factor. That is what we sell to the world. That is where our\nfuture lies.\nAnother of my favorite prime ministers was Winston Churchill. In the early years of the 20th\ncentury, Britain had a donnybrook of a debate—with Churchill and his free traders pitted against\nJoseph Chamberlain and the protectionists. Churchill saw how global competition would push a\nnation to make higher value-added products. Here is how he put it: “The country in which the\nsuperfine processes are performed—in which the superfine, the most complicated terminal stages\nof manufacture are performed—is the country which possesses what may be called commercial\n‘leadership.’ ” Today, I would broaden Churchill’s words to emphasize services and find\ncommercial leadership in nations, like ours, that possess the talents and experience needed to\nprovide the highest-valued services.\nThe answer to competition from the new countries that have joined the capitalist race is not to\nwrap ourselves in the toxic, defensive mantle of protectionism. That is akin to embracing\ninflation as a remedy to the credit market correction. The answer is to go on the offensive, to\nmaster and dominate the “superfine processes.” We must continue climbing the value-added\nladder into the most profitable and productive services. We must exploit this competitive\nadvantage, so we can continue growing our economy and expanding the welfare of our citizens.\nWe in Dallas, like you here in Chicago, are working diligently to sell our services to the rest of\nthe world. Progressive cities all over this great country are making yet another sweeping\ntransition—this time, to thinking and acting globally in the services arena—that promises to pave\na path that will allow us to remain the world’s premier economy for many, many years to come.\nCharlie, let me conclude by going back to my books and quoting another Charlie—Charles Eliot,\nwho was Harvard’s president for 40 years. He once said, “Books are the quietest and most\nconstant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors and the most patient of\nteachers.” I hope that in the essay you will find in the little, accessible book that is our annual\n6\n\n\freport some wise counsel and a quiet but reassuring ray of sunshine for this otherwise dark and\nimpatient world.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nWashington Irving, “A Time of Unexampled Prosperity,” The Crayon Papers: The Great Mississippi Bubble\n(1819–1820).\n2\n\nW.

            "content": "The Egocentricity of the Present\n(Prefaced by the Tale of Ruth and Emma)\nRemarks before a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Community Forum\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\nApril 9, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fThe Egocentricity of the Present\n(Prefaced by the Tale of Ruth and Emma)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Dick. I admire Dick Evans for many reasons. He is a smart banker. He is a devoted\nSan Antonian. He is a superb member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ board of directors.\nAnd he is married to Jimmie Ruth, who is living proof that men, even Dick Evans, can always be\nimproved upon.\nThe name Ruth evokes memories of my godmother, Ruth Walgren, who had a vivid sense of\nhumor. She lived to a very ripe old age and used to tell a story that went something like this:\nTwo women, Ruth and Emma, lived well into their 90s, surviving their husbands and practically\nall their friends in their little town. They had been best friends all their lives, growing up just a\nfew doors from each other and living just a few blocks apart since childhood. Age finally caught\nup with Ruth. In her final hours she told Emma: “You know what I remember most fondly?\nSoftball. My favorite thing in my long life was playing softball when we were girls. We were\ncarefree and happy and everything was just so perfect. Oh, Emma, I pray there is a softball team\nin heaven.”\n“My dear and oldest friend,” Emma said, “I loved playing softball too. If there is softball in\nheaven, will you send me a signal and let me know?”\n“I will, I promise,” said Ruth, and with that she smiled, closed her eyes and passed on.\nSeveral weeks later, on a Sunday night, Emma was peacefully lying in her bed. Suddenly a flash\nof intense light hovered above her bed. Ruth appeared as an angel. “Emma,” she said, “I have\ngood news and I have bad news.”\n“Oh, Ruthie,” Emma said, “tell me the good news.”\n“The good news, Emma, is that there is a softball team in heaven! All of our friends from\ngirlhood are here and so are our old teammates. We are all carefree girls again. We play all day\nin perfect weather. We never get tired. And we are happy, happy, happy and will be for eternity.\nIt is truly heavenly.”\n“Oh, Ruth, that is so wonderful,” Emma replied. “What better news could I have received on this\nfine Sunday night? What could possibly be the bad news?”\n“Well,” said Ruth, “the bad news is you are pitching on Tuesday.”\nSo often, just when all seems so good and just right, we receive an abrupt warning that things are\nabout to change, that we are going to be yanked from our comfortable existence and into the\nunknown. At that moment, we realize we have been enjoying a false sense of comfort. The\noutlook suddenly becomes less certain, even bleak, and we panic, wondering just how to deal\nwith our new predicament. This is especially true in economics.\n1\n\n\fLast Thursday, the Financial Times published a pithy little letter by Alex Pollock, a resident\nfellow of the American Enterprise Institute, questioning the assertion of a column written some\ndays earlier about the financial markets that had stated “we are in unknown territory facing\nsituations that have never arisen before.” Pollock’s response was that the current bursting of the\nhousing bubble exhibits time-honored boom–bust traditions. And then he penned this zinger: “In\nbooms it is proclaimed that we are in a ‘new era’—in busts that we have ‘unprecedented\nproblems.’ This is merely the egocentricity of the present.”\nI would like to talk today about the “egocentricity of the present” as it relates to the economy.\nWhat is the nature of the bubble we have experienced and what are the dynamics of the bust?\nHow is it affecting Texas? What is the proper role of the Federal Reserve in dealing with the\nsituation? And what might Texans do about it?\nTo begin, we need to spend a moment pondering the nature of risk. Perceptions of risk lie in the\neye of the beholder. Some see risk as a powerful force vital to capitalism; others consider it a\nfour-letter word. The latter view may be gaining currency these days, as risks taken in housing\nfinance have led to considerable stress in financial markets and weakness in the overall\neconomy.\nWe must not forget that prudent risk taking is the lifeblood of capitalism, especially in the\nAmerican form of capitalism where we are constantly replacing the old with the new, and the\nfamiliar with the new and the innovative. If we had not taken risks, we would never have created\nfrom scratch the $14 trillion U.S. economy.\nEvery one of us takes risks to advance our interests. A young person who goes to college, for\nexample, risks the certain income from today’s job, believing in the probability of a better paying\none after graduation. As we accumulate excess savings, we place them at risk by investing in\nstocks and bonds to secure our retirement. We take risks by borrowing to build our businesses,\nwith the expectation that a brighter future will enable us to repay our debts and then some.\nOf course, we also strive to manage risk. Once we are in the workforce, life insurance, for\nexample, hedges the risk that we might die before we have socked away enough money to\nprovide for our families. A prudent banker like Dick Evans drills down into the businesses he is\nlending to and knows them like the back of his hand in order to minimize risks to his short-term\ndepositors from providing businesses with long-term financing. And so on.\nThe necessity of risk taking as a pillar of market capitalism has also given rise to agents to\nservice it. Insurers and banks are two such agents, as are investment banks, money managers,\nhedge funds and other financial intermediaries that provide the means to assess, package and\ndistribute risk. In the old days, their job was fairly straightforward. The agents packaged straightup risk instruments like letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, simple loans\nand stocks, life and property insurance and fixed-rate mortgages. More recently, with the aid of\ntechnology and computational power that can assess probabilities at lightning speeds, the menu\nof risk instruments expanded dramatically. Financial intermediaries began offering exotic\nproducts to satisfy almost any risk taker’s needs anywhere in the world at any time. Hunger for\nthe new risk products was stimulated by a lengthy period of abnormally low interest rates and the\n2\n\n\fnormal human instinct to look for ever-higher yields when the returns on orthodox financial\ninstruments, like U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds or bank CDs, become ho-hum.\nOf course, like exotic foods, consumption of new risk products can lead to indigestion, and even\nallergic reactions. Lately, we have witnessed many allergic reactions—in the form of losses and\nsetbacks—especially among money center banks and other financial institutions whose fiduciary\neyes—as old Ruth Walgren would have said—“simply got too big for their stomachs.” What\nbegan as isolated pockets of trouble in the U.S. housing market soon spread to global markets in\nmortgage-backed securities, where many of the exotic home mortgage products were gobbled up.\nSoon it became obvious that financial market participants were gagging on the many types of\n“structured” credit products—not just those backed by mortgages—they were being served. As\nwe approached the summer of 2007, this gag reflex reached a pinnacle; the larger banks found it\ndifficult, if not impossible, to sell to others many types of loans; and the interbank lending\nmarket experienced intense liquidity pressures as banks became fearful of lending to each other\nfor longer than overnight.\nJust when things seemed so comfortable, when we were so happy as an economy, it is as though\nwe settled down for a peaceful night’s sleep on a Sunday night this past August, only to learn we\nwould be called to pitch on Tuesday, but with less pleasant prospects than those of our fictional\nfriend Emma. We’ve seen yet another historical cycle of excess risk-taking—in this case,\nconcentrated in financial innovations in credit and structured finance served up and consumed\nwithout regard for the downside—followed by extreme risk aversion.\nThis round of speculation and financial amnesia seems to have been driven by a combination of\nfactors, including an over-reliance on statistical models and rating agencies, excessive liquidity\nand perverse incentives compounded by an excess of complacency.\nIn assessing the situation, don’t let anyone convince you that we’ve entered a “new era.” The\ndetails may be different, but we’ve been here before. Allow me to temper the ego of the present\nby recalling the not-too-distant past and the events that happened right here in Texas.\nIn the 1980s, the euphoria of oil prices around $100 a barrel in today’s dollars led to a frenzy of\nlending activity in Texas. At least I think that’s what any reasonable observer would call the\nannual growth rate of business loans of over 40 percent at Texas banks and annual growth in\ncommercial real estate lending of almost 50 percent that we saw in the early part of that decade.\nBooking assets at such a rapid clip has a seductive power. My favorite line from the musical\n“Evita” is when she belts out, “All I want is a whole lot of excess!” Well, we certainly pursued\nexcess here in the 1980s. In pursuit of a seemingly sure thing, more than 550 new banks were\nchartered in Texas from 1980 through 1985. This made for a volatile brew, combining dramatic\nrates of growth in activity with a dramatic expansion of the number of players with limited\nexperience in knowing what to do when things go wrong. The assumption of permanently high,\nor permanently rising, prices in an asset class—in this case, oil—invariably leads to regrettable\ndecisions.\nYou recall what ensued. Real oil prices began to fall, contributing to an economic slowdown in\nthe region’s most energy-sensitive areas, such as Houston. The regional economy held its own\nfor a while, propelled by a red-hot commercial real estate sector. The state economy suffered a\nsevere decline, however, when oil collapsed to the current equivalent of around $22 per barrel by\n3\n\n\fmid-1986. Bank and thrift failures reached a frightful magnitude. More than 800 financial\ninstitutions went out of business in Texas during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Nine of the\n10 largest banking organizations based in Texas didn’t make it—the exception being Dick\nEvans’ Cullen Frost.\nThe energy bust reverberated through Texas, and it was keenly felt in both commercial and\nresidential real estate markets. Office vacancies soared. In Dallas and Houston, they hovered\naround 30 percent, and they approached 40 percent in Austin. Employment growth flatlined and\nrecession ensued.\nThe nation’s current difficulties took root not in the oil market, but in the U.S. housing market.\nAfter several years of startling increases in home prices and financing activity, things began to\nunravel several quarters ago. But the roots of the current crisis were like those of earlier bubbles.\nThey originated in the seductive power of price escalation—of a “whole lot of excess”—and the\negocentricity of the present, which led some to believe we had entered a “new era.” We either\ndidn’t notice this elaborate conceit or failed to deal with it. But it was there. Many coastal areas\nof the U.S. were beginning to see 20 to 30 percent year-over-year increases in house prices, some\neven as high as 30 to 40 percent. Subprime mortgage borrowing, or lending to less creditworthy\nindividuals by lenders who were eager to finance a “sure thing,” exploded. The good news is that\nlevels of homeownership among the U.S. population reached unprecedented heights, extending\nthe American dream to more people than ever before. The bad news is that the methods used to\ndo so were not sustainable.\nLet me give you some numbers to focus the mind. In 1999, before home prices started to defy\ngravity, 55 percent of homes sold in the New York metro area were considered affordable to the\nmedian-income family by one industry gauge. When home prices peaked at the end of 2006, that\npercentage had fallen to just 5 percent. In Los Angeles in 1999, 43 percent of homes were\naffordable to the median-income family, but only 2 percent were by the end of 2006. Two\npercent! Compare that to Texas. In Dallas in 1999, 64 percent of homes were affordable, by 2006\nthat percentage had barely slipped to 62 percent. In Austin, home prices actually became more\naffordable over this period, in contrast to the U.S. as a whole.\nThe chairman of Presidents Nixon and Ford’s Council of Economic Advisers, Herb Stein, was\nfond of saying that, “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” Eventually the conceit of a\n“new era” in housing could not go on forever, and it stopped. The bubble popped, and a harsh\ncorrection has ensued.\nWith that abridged historical background, let’s turn back to the financial markets. We saw a\nwave of innovative mortgage products during the housing boom. Indeed, there would have been\nno other way for many borrowers to have procured financing without these new mortgage\nproducts.\nThese innovations in financing took two forms. First, credit-scoring models enabled lenders to\nbetter sort and price mortgages made to nonprime borrowers. The second set of innovations\nallowed these loans to be funded and sold to a new class of investors. While traditional\nmortgages had long been securitized and sold through government-sponsored enterprises such as\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the securitization market ushered in new players from the private\n4\n\n\fsector who would hold nonprime mortgages that could not meet the standards of Fannie and\nFreddie and that banks would generally not hold in portfolios.\nThese so-called structured credit products became all the rage with investors. These new and\ncomplex securities sliced and diced risk into different tranches. It was thought that the\ncollateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations could be hedged with credit\ndefault swaps to make them seem almost risk free. And, if you could do so with mortgage loans,\nwhy not credit card loans, auto loans and other types of debt?\nThings began to unravel once it became apparent that the housing bubble could not expand\nforever. Losses began to be recorded on traditional mortgage-backed securities, with the newer\ntypes of structured finance products used to securitize the newer types of mortgage lending being\nespecially hard hit. It didn’t stop there. Banks in other countries that had invested in the toogood-to-be-true U.S. housing market through these products began to record large losses. Even\nsome that weren’t directly involved in the U.S. housing sector or these products still felt the\nrepercussions; who could have imagined that house price declines in the U.S. would contribute to\na bank run in England?\nAll types of structured credit products soon came under suspicion. Issuance of asset-backed\ncommercial paper declined sharply beginning last summer. Although some of that paper was\nbacked by mortgages, not all of it was. But that didn’t seem to matter. The market for auction\nrate municipal bonds was also hit, as doubts spread regarding the financial health of the\nmisnamed “monoline” insurers. Investment banks also experienced abnormal difficulties in the\nusually routine task of syndicating their leveraged loans in the private equity sphere, which is\nfairly remote from the mortgage industry, to say the least.\nThe banking industry was smack in the middle of this maelstrom. This sector is of obvious\nimportance to the Federal Reserve. Not surprisingly, large losses have been recorded at some of\nthe largest banks. Their capital ratios are also under pressure from the fallout in the securitization\nmarkets. The difficulty in selling loans and the increase in lending to borrowers who were shut\nout of the securitization markets have increased banks’ exposure. In addition, some banks that\noffered off-balance-sheet commitments to their structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, have\nfound themselves having to move these assets onto their balance sheets. All this asset onboarding has pressured capital ratios. Combine these pressures with the difficulty of establishing\nvalues for structured credit products in seized-up markets and it is no surprise that term interbank\nlending thinned out considerably.\nThat’s what happened. There will be lots of theories as to how it happened. Mine is fairly\nstraightforward: however many “quants” from MIT or Cal Tech or UT San Antonio you bring in\nto build models that theorize away risk, there is no overturning the fundamental law that the\nprice of an asset is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it. Mathematical models\ncomplement judgment and experience but are no substitute for them. Judgment and experience,\nincluding our own vivid experience here in Texas in the 1980s, teach us that in booms and\nbubbles, prices overshoot and during busts, they overcorrect.\nTo a great extent, the bubble in housing was a classic case of the bigger-fool theory and efficientmarket theory run amok. The excesses in subprime lending in the United States were fed by an\nexcessive amount of faith in technically sophisticated approaches to risk management and a\n5\n\n\fmisguided belief that mathematical models could price securitized assets, including securities\nbased on mortgages, accurately. These valuation methodologies were so technical and\nmathematically sophisticated that their utter complexity lulled many people into a false sense of\nsecurity. In the end, complexity proved hopelessly inadequate as an all-encompassing measure of\nrisk, despite its frequent advertisement as such. The risk models employed turned out to be\nmerely formulaic descriptions of the past and created an illusion of precision. Such approaches\ncould not and cannot replace the forward-looking judgment of a seasoned professional.\nSeasoned investors and creditors know that incomplete information—or information asymmetry,\nin technical jargon—is a fact of life in financial markets. In fact, the presence of information\nasymmetries goes a long way toward explaining the structure of financial markets and\ninstitutions. In our system, we have implemented a process of “delegated monitoring” to address\nthese asymmetries.\nLet me explain what I mean by “delegated monitoring.” Because an individual saver would be\nhard-pressed to monitor the many potential borrowers to whom they could lend, they have\ndelegated that monitoring role to their bank, which then is in charge of keeping tabs on\nborrowers. In the U.S., where the safety of deposits at most banks is federally guaranteed,\nregulators are a delegated monitor, loosely speaking, watching over banks on behalf of their\ncollective depositors.\nThe regulators also are not above delegating some work. Rather than attempting to monitor the\nentire universe of financial institutions, U.S. regulators rely heavily on a core group of very large\nmoney center banks with significant exposures, expecting them to act as delegated monitors,\ndisciplining the remaining players in the financial system through effective controls on\ncounterparty risk by assessing and limiting the risk of other banks, hedge funds and private\nequity firms. And finally, regulators and investors alike have come to depend on ratings agencies\nto assess and monitor firms and securities on their behalf.\nAll these complex monitoring arrangements are motivated, at least in part, by the fact that\ninformation is costly. Yet it seems to me that a lot of our recent problems can be attributed to\nbreakdowns in this chain of delegated monitoring. To this end, the secretary of the Treasury has\nput forward recommendations to modernize and clarify the chain of command of delegated\nmonitoring. We are studying the recommendations he has made—as is the Congress and\nothers—and will contemplate them dispassionately over time.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is doing its level best to facilitate the process of price discovery\nand adjustment from a period of excess in a manner that restores the efficacy of the financial\nsystem.\nHere is a simple analogy to help you think about our effort. The Federal Reserve is charged with\nconducting monetary policy that sustains noninflationary economic growth. We have at our\ndisposal a tool called the federal funds rate, which we set as the base lending rate for the\neconomy. Think of the fed funds rate as a monetary spigot, and the Fed’s goal is keeping the\nlawn of the economy green and healthy. If we turn the spigot up too forcefully, we will flood and\nkill the grass with inflation. If we provide too little, the lawn turns brown, starved for money. To\nget the money from the spigot to the lawn requires a working system of pipes and sprinkler\nheads. The “shadow banking system,” however, looks like a Rube Goldberg device designed by\n6\n\n\fa hydrologist on acid, with pipes and conduits that lead every which way and not always toward\nthe goal of sustainable economic growth. Moreover, the system of pipes and outlets is clogged\nwith the muck and residue of a prolonged and frenetic period of unrestrained growth and abuse.\nUntil the confusion and the debris are cleared away, financial intermediaries will be reluctant to\nbook new loans or incur additional risk. This retards the impact of additional monetary\naccommodation.\nThus, even as we have been cutting the fed funds rate—even as we have been opening the\nmonetary spigot—interest rates for private sector borrowers have not fallen correspondingly, and\nrates for some borrowers have increased. The grass is turning brown.\nTo address this problem, we have created some new facilities that should provide a liquidity\nbridge over the currently dysfunctional system while the marketplace and regulators—ourselves\nincluded—go about restoring the system’s plumbing.\nThe term auction facility—known by its acronym, TAF—was introduced in December as an\nentirely new approach to funding problems at banks. Those who are eligible for primary credit at\nthe Fed’s traditional discount window can now bid at bimonthly auctions for term funds. So far,\nthe auctions have been well-subscribed and term funding pressures abated after the introduction\nof the TAF. The term securities lending facility we announced last month expands the Fed’s\nsecurities lending program. Securities will now be made available through an auction process\nwith an expanded array of collateral on a weekly basis for a term of 28 days. We also set up a\nprimary dealer credit facility, an overnight lending facility that provides funding to primary\ndealers in exchange for a range of eligible collateral. And, at the request of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, the Board of Governors of the Fed approved a loan to J. P. Morgan so that\nthat bank might digest the exposure that many counterparties had to Bear Stearns, without\nrewarding Bear Stearns shareholders for the imprudent risks assumed by their management.\nTo repeat, the objective of all this activity is to provide a bridge for the financial system while it\ntransitions from a period of indiscriminate excess and gets back to normalcy. I do not believe the\nFed should be, or is, “bailing out” any particular institution. Nor do I personally believe that any\ninstitution in and of itself is “too big to fail.” But I do believe that we must have a financial\nsystem that is in working order. We must have a system where the chain of delegated monitors\noperates smoothly and efficiently. We must have a system where the pipes that nourish\ncapitalism sustain the fertile lawn that is the American economy. It is the Fed’s duty as lender of\nlast resort to lead the way to restoring the efficacy of the financial system.\nThe Fed has made some tough judgment calls lately, and, having been party to making those\ncalls, I can assure you they certainly were not made lightly. In principle, we know that the\nmarket should decide the winners and losers, who survives and who fails. I am a big fan of\nWinston Churchill. “It is always more easy to discover and proclaim general principles than to\napply them,” Churchill said. I now know full well what he meant.\nLooking to the future, and in summary, the emerging discussion on new regulations and a new\nsupervisory framework should proceed, but regulations by themselves cannot replace good\njudgment by individual investors or bankers or financiers, and certainly by policymakers.\nPolicymakers need to remain vigilant in seeking the right balance between prudent and\nindiscriminate risk taking. But the elimination of risk—and the consequences of incurring risk—\n7\n\n\fcan never be the goal of any policymaker in a capitalist system. In building the bridge to restore\nfinancial order and efficiency, my primary interest is to do the minimum necessary to get the job\ndone. And no more. In so doing, my hope is that we restore the long-term faith of the millions of\nrisk takers who make our economy so mighty.\nHaving used the term “mighty,” let me turn to Texas. Texas’ housing, as mentioned earlier, is\naffordable. Our industrial mix creates jobs that are appealing. People continue to move here from\nthe high-priced East and West Coasts and the Midwest, where the job market has been softer. We\nare a thriving engine of growth in an otherwise anemic economy.\nHere are some data to prove the point. Between 2004 and 2007, job growth in the expensive\ncities on the East and West Coasts was 4 percent or less. In manufacturing-oriented cities of the\nMidwest, the job market was weaker, with Cleveland and Detroit posting declines. By contrast,\nbetween 2004 and 2007 employment in Dallas grew by 8.9 percent. In Houston, by over 12\npercent! Last year, almost one-third of all the private sector jobs created across America were\ncreated in our state. Let me repeat that: Over 30 percent of all the private sector jobs created in\nAmerica last year were created right here in the Lone Star State.\nAs a Texan speaking to a room full of Texans, I would be remiss if I didn’t offer my two cents\nabout what this state ought to be doing in times like these. Before he became president, Jack\nKennedy reminded an audience that the Chinese character for the word “crisis” has two brush\nstrokes. One stroke means danger, the other means opportunity. As Kennedy so wisely put it, “In\na crisis, be aware of the danger but recognize the opportunity.”\nThe housing crisis may not yet have run its course, and further danger could lie ahead both for\nthe nation and also for Texas. We may seem isolated from the rest of the nation’s woes, but we\nare not immune from the dangers they pose. Still, as I survey the Texan economic landscape, I\nsense we have an opportunity here. Our economy is growing. We’re an affordable and wonderful\nplace to live. And we hunger for workers—as recently as this morning I heard anecdotal reports\nof labor shortages in parts of Texas.\nThe U.S. economy will continue to suffer from a bout of anemia while the housing and financial\nmarkets settle down. I take comfort, however, in knowing that markets eventually clear if we at\nthe Fed do our job and the other regulators and fiscal authorities do theirs. Even in the egocentric\npresent, when gloomy analysts lament “unprecedented problems,” we must never lose faith in\nthe economic machine that has propelled the U.S. economy to unprecedented prosperity. You\nneed look no further than to what is happening in our own state for proof of our nation’s inherent\nresiliency. All I ask of you as San Antonians and as Texans is that you continue to serve as the\nexemplar of what can be accomplished by properly managing risk and turning “unprecedented\nproblems” into unrivaled opportunities, as Americans have done time and time again.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Comments on Stylized Facts\nof Globalization and World Inflation\nRemarks for a panel discussion at the International Symposium\nof the Banque de France on Globalisation, Inflation and Monetary Policy\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nParis, France\nMarch 7, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fComments on Stylized Facts of Globalization and World Inflation\nRichard W. Fisher\nFirst, I’d like to thank Governor [Christian] Noyer for the invitation to participate in this\nconference. The topic could not be more timely, and it is one that is close to my heart. It is a\ngreat privilege to discuss this paper by Ken Rogoff.\nWhen I took office as president of the Dallas Fed three years ago, I made it clear that I wanted\nour signature research issue for the coming years to be the study of the implications of\nglobalization for the conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. To this end, we have created a\nGlobalization and Monetary Policy Institute and have assembled a blue-ribbon advisory board\nthat includes Ken Rogoff among its members.\nLet me start by posing a rhetorical question. Should the default framework for thinking about\nmonetary policy in a country like the U.S. or, indeed, in the euro area, be an open economy\nwhere capital flows across national borders, goods and services are sourced from the cheapest\nglobal suppliers, interest rate movements in one country impact rates in another, and exchange\nrates factor in firms’ pricing and production decisions? Or can we get by thinking in closedeconomy terms, where domestic investment is financed with domestic savings, we only consume\nwhat we produce, interest rates are determined at home and exchange rates are irrelevant?\nNobody who has lived on the planet since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ascendancy of Deng\nXiaoping would likely testify to the validity of the second proposition. Globalization means that\nwe can no longer guide policy by ignoring trade and capital flows or the invisible but nonetheless\neffective links between countries that have been forged through cyberspace. Yet it appears to me\nthat the default framework for thinking about monetary policy continues to be the closedeconomy model.\nNow on to Professor Rogoff’s paper. Ken’s paper starts with a review of some of the salient facts\nabout globalization and segues to a discussion about the seeming resilience of the globalized\nworld economy and the important role that better monetary policy plays in ensuring that\nresilience. He then proceeds with a discussion of the central role China seems to be playing in\nthe recent acceleration of globalization, assesses its impact on global commodity prices and then\nwraps up with a very nice discussion of whether the recent subprime crisis is all that different\nfrom previous banking crises.\nGlobalization means different things to different people. To the Chinese peasant it may mean the\nprospect of an end to poverty and steady improvement in his living standards. To the American\nor French factory worker it may mean the threat of cheap imports and the potential outsourcing\nof his or her job. To the environmental activist it may mean the despoliation of the earth’s\natmosphere as more countries industrialize and pour pollutants into the atmosphere. To the\npublic intellectual it may mean the loss of national identity and the Americanization of culture.\nThere are many important dimensions to globalization, but as a central banker, I am most\ninterested in the economic dimensions, namely the greater integration of national economies\nthrough increased trade of goods and services, investment, migration, and task allocation. All of\nthese facilitate the dissemination of ideas and technologies that are another key manifestation of\nglobalization and indeed contribute to its spread.\n1\n\n\fHowever, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a good handle on just how rapidly the world is\nglobalizing. As Ken notes, there is a lot of hype out there about how many new workers and\nconsumers have become part of the global economy as a result of the demise of communism and\nthe opening of China, India and other economies. The raw numbers in terms of population are\nhuge—we are talking billions with a “b”—but the true extent to which the workers in these\ncountries are, for want of a better word, substitutable for workers in advanced economies is an\nopen question. It is this substitutability that determines how the coming on line of this new labor\nforce will impact the wages of workers in the advanced economies. It would appear that the\nnumber of workers in countries like China and India who possess skills comparable to those\nfound among the workforces of the U.S., Europe and other advanced nations is a small subset of\nthe headline numbers.\nIt is worth reminding the audience that the nominal per capita income of the average Chinese\ncitizen today is, in inflation-adjusted terms, roughly equivalent to that of an American worker in\nthe early 1900s. And yet, for those workers who possess the skills demanded by a modern\neconomy, wages have rapidly approached advanced-economy levels. There are abundant\nanecdotal reports that the salaries of top programmers in Mumbai are quickly converging to\nthose of their peers in Silicon Valley. Likewise, there is rapid wage growth for managers in\nChina who can work in Western companies. Indeed, just last week the Financial Times reported\non million-dollar bonuses paid to certain Chinese executives in the financial sector. But the vast\nmajority of the new workers in the global economy at present bring little more than their raw\nlabor and thirst for betterment.\nTechnological improvements and policy changes have both been important drivers of\nglobalization. The information technology revolution has played an important role in breaking\ndown the barrier between those goods and services that were hitherto thought to be tradable\nacross national borders and those that were not. Services that were long considered to be the\nquintessential nontradable good are increasingly traded internationally. If you do the numbers,\nyou will find that the U.S. exports a lot more services than it imports, and moving up the valueadded chain into more service-oriented sectors is key to the continued competitiveness of the\nU.S. economy.\nBy some measures, financial globalization has proceeded even more rapidly than the “real”\nglobalization that is rooted in trade flows. In some sense, this is not too surprising. While\ninnovations in transportation technology—such as the inventions of container shipping and the\njumbo jet that Ken mentions in his presentation—have helped reduce the effective geographic\ndistance between countries, making it easier to trade goods, distance in a very fundamental sense\nstill matters for trade. However, the information technology revolution has effectively eliminated\nthe idea of geographic distance in financial and several other service transactions. Financial\ntrades can be executed at any time of the day in any part of the world at the click of a mouse.\nArchitectural renderings can be created thousands of miles from the firm that commissions them.\nX-rays and CAT scans of patients in Dallas or Paris can be analyzed in Sydney or Delhi while\ntheir Texan or French doctors sleep. As long as the earth rotates on its axis and satellite and\nInternet connections are maintained, technology never sleeps in a globalized world, nor does the\nproduction of other goods and services.\n\n2\n\n\fGlobalization is not new. Some of the key technical innovations that make today’s globalization\npossible are a half century old or older. But it is perhaps worth emphasizing that much of the\nglobalization that occurred in the immediate post-World War II period was simply getting us\nback to where we were on the eve of World War I. As is well known, by the early 1970s, trade\nflows had gotten back to where they were in 1913, but other key dimensions of globalization,\ncapital flows and migration, were still well below their pre-World War I levels. Indeed, the\nreversal of globalization in the interwar period is something we should never forget and serves as\na reminder that we cannot take a liberal international economic order for granted.\nWriting shortly after the end of World War I, John Maynard Keynes commented on how\nthoroughly “internationalized” (his expression) the world was in 1913. It is worth repeating what\nhe said: “The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the\nvarious products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect\ntheir early delivery upon his door-step; …[and] at the same moment and by the same means\nadventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and\nshare, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could\ndecide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any\nsubstantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could\nsecure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or\nclimate without passport or other formality, could dispatch his servant to the neighboring office\nof a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then\nproceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs,\nbearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much\nsurprised at the least interference.” Most important of all, this average inhabitant of London\n“…regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of\nfurther improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”\nThat rather bucolic description of globalization as it once was practiced was penned by Keynes\nin The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919. It seems unlikely that the unique set of\ncircumstances that led to the collapse of globalization between the great wars of the twentieth\ncentury will ever be repeated, but newer twenty-first century challenges could just as easily\nimpede the progress of globalization.\nTaking a very long-term perspective on globalization, looking at it from the perspective of\ncenturies and not just decades, also teaches us something about the role of the monetary standard\nin promoting international economic integration. The nominal stability associated with the gold\nstandard played an important role in fostering globalization in the nineteenth century. The\ntransition to a fiat standard created some challenges for central bankers, but in recent years\ncentral bankers have come to a better understanding of how they need to conduct monetary\npolicy under a fiat standard and have done a good job at delivering price stability. Ken is right:\nHigh inflation is much rarer now, with only two countries experiencing what might be\nconsidered very high or hyperinflations. This greater nominal stability is a key factor underlying\nthe surge of globalization over the past decade and a half and remains vital to continued\nprogress.\nBut how resilient are the new monetary frameworks? Is the adoption of formal or informal\ninflation targeting the key to central bank successes in recent years, or have they been the\nbeneficiaries of a dollop of good luck in the form of higher productivity growth? Better monetary\n3\n\n\fpolicy helped make greater globalization and faster productivity growth possible, but\nglobalization and faster productivity growth also made the jobs of central bankers easier. The\nmore challenging circumstances that have developed over the recent past—as the tailwinds that\nensued from the addition of new workers to the production side of global output have morphed\ninto headwinds of demand for scarce resources—will serve to stress-test the new monetary\npolicy frameworks in ways they have not been tested before.\nNo discussion of globalization would be complete without some mention of China’s\nextraordinary growth over the past decade. The raw numbers are staggering, from the rapid\nurbanization of its population to the extraordinary increases in output year after year and the\nvoracious demand for raw materials as it becomes the workshop of the world. Ken asks what\nwould happen to the favorable inflation and productivity environment if internal stresses in\nChinese society were to cause the authorities to slow down or even reverse some of the recent\nmarket reforms. There can be little doubt that the Chinese authorities face a gargantuan task in\nmanaging the transition of the economy to a free-market system. Recent strains have manifested\nthemselves in higher inflation, and the ability of the authorities to control that inflation is clearly\nhindered by the exchange-rate regime. Greater exchange-rate flexibility will enhance the ability\nof the People’s Bank of China to deliver price stability, the surest contribution any central bank\ncan make to improvements in living standards over the long term.\nGlobalization does matter for inflation, but not in the ways that are often suggested in the media.\nThe most common fallacy is, of course, the confusion of relative price with price level changes,\nthe idea that a flood of cheap imports from China must of necessity lower the price level and the\ninflation rate. The channels whereby globalization affects inflation are much more subtle and not\nalways necessarily benign. Furthermore, I believe that different dimensions of globalization\naffect the dynamics of inflation in fundamentally different ways.\nLet’s start with trade. The availability of cheap imports from China and other countries does\nhave a direct and indirect impact on domestic prices and inflation. There has been a significant\namount of work in recent years trying to document the size of this effect. The estimates vary, but\nthey are generally significant. But the mechanism whereby the price changes are realized is\nsubtle. Yes, there is a direct effect through the availability of cheaper imports. When those\ncheaper imports are inputs into the production process, we know they directly lower prices at\nhome. The price effect is not just relative, but absolute. But that will be offset to some extent as\nconsumers use their enhanced purchasing power to buy more of other products, putting upward\npressure on prices. The threat of competition also has an effect on the pricing decisions of\ndomestic firms, both for firms producing products that are close substitutes for the imported\ngoods and for firms that use those imports as inputs. Cheaper imports will also have an impact on\nthe wage demands of workers who consume those goods. Of course, the effect is not all in one\ndirection, as Ken notes in his paper. The downside of the rapid growth in production in low-wage\ncountries is the upward pressure that this growth has put on commodity prices worldwide. Faster\ngrowth in incomes is having a significant effect on global food prices, although some of the\nrecent increases have been driven by policy changes encouraging the production of biofuels and\nsupply-side developments as well.\nThe thirst of the emerging-market economies for raw materials and the relative inefficiency with\nwhich they use these raw materials has propelled industrial commodity prices to record levels.\nThe fact that these increases have been persistent and not quickly reversed has raised tough\n4\n\n\fquestions about traditional measures of core inflation and made it increasingly difficult for\ncentral bankers to separate signal from noise in the inflation data. We in Dallas look at not just\nthe traditional measure of core inflation that simply excludes food and energy prices, but also a\ntrimmed mean measure that we think gives a better sense of where trends may be headed. While\nan improvement on the traditional measure, it too has some shortcomings, and I believe that over\nthe long term, the price stability that matters most to the people who pay our salaries, since they\ndo eat and they do drive, is stability of a comprehensive measure of prices.\nGlobalization of labor markets also matters for inflation dynamics. Now, one of the key\ndifferences between the current era of globalization and the one that preceded WWI has to do\nwith the greater restrictions on international movement of labor. We don’t see the same mass\nmovements of people as characterized the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and with\nmore countries providing social safety nets, and the equivalent of “virtual immigration” through\ncyberspace, we are unlikely to see such mass migrations ever again. Nevertheless, for some\ncountries, recent movements of workers have been quantitatively large enough to affect prices.\nThe recent expansion of the European Union and the freeing of labor mobility has clearly made a\ndifference to wage and price dynamics in Europe. Whether this is a one-off effect associated with\na permanent reallocation of labor from low-wage to high-wage countries or a longer-term\ndevelopment whereby workers are more willing to move in search of job opportunities in\nresponse to the business cycle, it is too early to say.\nThe third key dimension of globalization—that of capital markets—also matters for inflation, but\nin a way that fundamentally differs from trade flows and migration. Greater international capital\nmobility seems to have a disciplining effect on policymakers worldwide by making it costly to\nengage in reckless fiscal or monetary policies. But again, I think there is two-way causation.\nSounder monetary policy in more countries has contributed to the willingness of investors to\nventure abroad, but the ease with which capital can take flight has also made it more costly for\ncentral banks to deviate from the new orthodoxy of price stability.\nThe fourth dimension is the least understood. That is the global assignment of tasks through\nnontraditional channels. The U.S. is a high-value-added, services-driven economy; services\nrepresent over 80 percent of our economy. The growth of service sector trade, particularly\nthrough fiber optic cable and satellite connections, poses significant measurement issues. It is not\nas if we can just go down to the docks and count containers coming and going to quantify the\nimpact of service sector trade. And what implication does the increasing trade in tasks with\ncheap labor pools around the globe pose for pricing of services and, in turn, for inflation?\nKen’s final point has to do with the skepticism of some academics about the implications of\nglobalization for monetary policy. He cites a recent important paper by Michael Woodford as a\nrepresentative example, so let me conclude with two observations related to that paper. First, I\nthink there is an element of talking at cross purposes in some of the exchanges that have taken\nplace on what globalization may or may not mean for monetary policy. I am in substantive\nagreement with Woodford that globalization does not undermine the ability of the Fed, or any\nother central bank for that matter, to control inflation over an appropriate time horizon, but it\ndoes challenge us—you might say it disciplines us—to conduct monetary policy more prudently.\nIn today’s world, where investors can move their funds instantly from one currency to another to\navoid depreciation, the price central bankers pay for high inflation is much higher than in the\npast. Understanding this, you can see why I am a steadfast inflation-fighting owl.\n5\n\n\fGlobalization also should make us change the way we interpret some of the indicators that have\ntraditionally played such an important role in monetary policy deliberations. Globalization\nindeed warrants the examination of a broader array of data in arriving at monetary policy\ndecisions. For example, understanding global capacity utilization in an industry may be more\nuseful than equivalent measures of domestic capacity. Second, the elegance of Woodford’s\nexposition notwithstanding, we are still some way from having a consensus model of how the\ndomestic and international economy works. Enormous progress has been made in recent decades,\ndue in no small part to the work of scholars like Ken Rogoff and Michael Woodford, but a lot\nmore remains to be done, and we are spending an enormous amount of time doing it at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas. At times of rapid structural change, it is important to keep an\nopen mind and challenge old assumptions and paradigms, within a framework of disciplined,\nevidence-based scientific inquiry.\n\n6\n\n\f"

            "content": "Balancing Inflation and Growth\nRemarks before the Society of Business Economists\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nLondon, England\nMarch 4, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fBalancing Inflation and Growth\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an honor to speak here in London to the Society of Business Economists at the suggestion of\nmy much-admired friend, Charlie Bean at the Bank of England. Charlie is on the advisory board\nof the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and we are most grateful for his\ninsight and, not unimportantly, his wit.\nI am on my way to a conference in Paris, where I have been invited by the Banque de France to\ncomment on a paper by another of our institute’s esteemed advisors, Harvard professor Ken\nRogoff. I hope my French hosts will forgive me for bringing up my favorite of all of\nShakespeare’s histories this evening, Henry V, as I recall one of the more pleasant moments\nduring my tenure on the Federal Open Market Committee. During our last meeting with Alan\nGreenspan as chairman, some of us took advantage of the moment to ham it up and work a\nfarewell salute into our otherwise somber interventions. I chose to adapt Henry’s speech to the\ntroops at Agincourt. Affecting my best Kenneth Branagh imitation, I mangled the words of the\nBard: “We few, we happy few, we band of bankers,” and so on, concluding with the observation\nthat “…other economists now abed”—it was morning when we met—“shall think themselves\naccursed they were not here, and hold their policy prescriptions cheap while any speaks that\nserved in Alan Greenspan’s days.” When I finished, Alan looked down the table and said,\n“President Fisher, was that Henry V?” “Yes, Mr. Chairman,” I replied. “I know I’ve reached\nretirement age,” said the ancient chairman. “I went to high school with that guy.”\nWould that we could today enjoy such levity from the days when SIVs, CDOs, ARS and SLARS\nand VRDOs—or the “R” or the “S” words, as in “recession” and “stagflation”—were not yet part\nof the polite lexicon of monetary circles. These are not the happiest of times. These are, to put it\neuphemistically, challenging times for central bankers. We are confronted with the twin evils of\nslower growth and higher inflation, while also having to fight a banging hangover that resulted\nfrom allowing financial intermediaries to party on too hard for too long.\nThe monetary policy and regulatory frameworks that appeared to serve us so well in past decades\nare being stress-tested in ways that few dared imagine during that bucolic period when many\nwere lulled into assuming things would be forever NICE, as Mervyn King so memorably put it. 1\nWe know now that a Non-Inflationary Consistent Expansion is not the steady state of nature.\nNeither is the Great Moderation of both the economy and financial market volatility.\nIndeed, as I speak, central bankers here and across both the pond and the channel feel besieged\nby a seemingly insurmountable foe delivering retribution for our having been complacent, if not\nsmug, during those happier days. Like Henry’s troops at Agincourt, it may appear that we face\noverwhelming odds. Yet I am not overwhelmed.\nWhy not, you ask? Allow me to invoke another of your English ancestors in reply. Winston\nChurchill once asked: “Why is it that the ship beats the waves, when they are so many and the\n\n1 Mervyn King, Speech to East Midlands Development Agency/Bank of England Dinner in Leicester, Oct. 14, 2003.\n\n1\n\n\fship is one? The reason is that the ship has a purpose.” Tonight, I wish to give my view of the\npurpose of the Federal Reserve.\nNeedless to say—but I will say so anyway—the views I express this evening will be my own and\nnot those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or any official of the\nFederal Reserve System. This is but one man’s soliloquy.\nThe Federal Reserve, unlike the Bank of England, has a dual mandate. We are charged with\ncreating the monetary conditions to support sustainable noninflationary employment growth. We\nmust keep our eyes on two things: economic growth and price pressures. Of course, this is easier\nsaid than done. It poses a conundrum of priority and balance. How should we weigh the risks of\nslow growth over the need to manage inflation? Reasonable men and women can agree that\ninflation is a sinister beast that, if untethered, will devour savings, erode the purchasing power of\nconsumers, decimate returns on capital, undermine the reliability of financial accounting, distract\nthe attention of corporate management and undercut employment growth and real wages.\nThoughtful men and women can also agree that at certain junctures, sluggish employment\ngrowth and financial instability present greater risks than inflation to the economic welfare of the\nnation. Both feverish price pressures and economic anemia matter, and both present great risk to\nour welfare. Both deserve our attention. But the question of the day is which deserves more of\nour attention right now.\nSome argue it is the slowing economy. Even if you foresee the most likely U.S. scenario as a\nperiod of flat growth for a few quarters, followed later in the year by a return to potential growth\nof about 3 percent, one cannot help but worry about whether the so-called tail risk—the odds of\nthe worst-case scenario on the growth distribution curve unfolding—is getting fatter as the\ninventory of unsold homes continues to swell, consumers’ sense of wealth and businesses’\nconfidence erodes, and the solicitous bankers that used to court them become more coy.\nYet, the worst-case scenario remains very much a “tail” risk. As Chairman Bernanke noted in\ntestimony before Congress last week, the nonfinancial sector has held up reasonably well and\ncontinues to expand. Employment growth is weakening and consumer confidence is sagging, but\ninventories and other indicators remain constructive. You can see evidence of this in the fourth\nquarter’s corporate performance. Thomson Financial reported last week that earnings were on\ntrack to be down 22 percent for the 462 S&P 500 companies that have so far released their\nnumbers for the quarter. But strip out the financial institutions, and earnings were up 12 percent,\nand 62 percent of those 462 companies reported earnings that topped analysts’ expectations. In\nall, that is not bad when you consider the beating the financials have taken and how stocks of\nhousing and housing-related companies have been pummeled.\nThe woes of financial operators should not be overlooked, of course. There is a palpable risk that\ntheir pathology will lead to credit constriction that will, in turn, trigger an economic contraction.\nBut thus far, the Cassandras on Wall Street, in the press and on the political campaign trails have\nhad less to be glum about than they expected—or perhaps they had hoped for.\nThis is not to say that we are not at risk of encountering turbulence. Personally, I think the\ncruising speed of the U.S. economy has slowed considerably, and it is likely to remain subpar for\nthe current and following quarter. Without getting into specific numbers, I will tell you that my\ngrowth forecast is one of the more bearish among FOMC members. For someone like me, who\n2\n\n\fhas served on corporate boards and run a private company, it is not difficult to imagine managers\nbeing cautioned by their directors and consultants to batten down their hatches and run ever\ntighter ships at a time of gloomy news stories, dire predictions by respectable analysts and\nalarming rhetoric from public officials. While there is a risk the U.S. economy might sputter, I do\nnot believe that mighty engine will stall. I have tremendous faith in the ability of the women and\nmen who operate the private sector to overcome obstacles placed before them and keep the\npistons of the economy pumping. You can lose a lot of money betting against the recuperative\npower of the American economy.\nAt the same time, I am fully aware that the FOMC must be careful to not undermine that\nrecuperative process. Here, of course, I refer to the potential harm to the consumer and the\nbusiness and financial sectors alike by unwittingly allowing the perception to take hold that, as\nthe New York Times editorialized in its lead front page article last Thursday, “the Federal\nReserve, signaled [its] readiness … to bolster the economy with cheaper money even though\ninflation is picking up speed.” 2\nTalk of “cheap money” makes my skin crawl. The words imply a debased currency and inflation\nand the harsh medicine that inevitably must be administered to purge it. So you should not be\nsurprised that I consider the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy, should it\ntake root, to be a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy.\nI believe the Times overstates its case. Chairman Bernanke made clear in his congressional\ntestimony last week that we are monitoring inflationary pressures and expectations closely. And\nyet, I understand the source of the Times’ sentiment. In a globalized capital market where money\nis free to move anywhere it pleases, there is scant tolerance for even the slightest whiff of\ninflation. Since the January FOMC meeting, longer-term rates, including those on fixed\nmortgages, have risen rather than followed the federal funds rate downward. Over the same\nperiod, the dollar has declined nearly 3 percent against the euro. We know that monetary policy\nacts with a lag, but even with my well-documented pessimism about the efficacy of lowering the\nfed funds rate to 3 percent, I had privately hoped, against the odds, that we might get a\npsychological pop out of the yield curve. Instead, we have heard more and more reports of\ninflationary concerns, and with them increases in longer-term rates and record low exchange\nrates for the dollar.\nMind you, all these signals could be aberrations—twitches in markets that have occasionally led\nme to wonder if they were afflicted with the financial equivalent of Tourette’s syndrome. But\nthey might also indicate that the markets are unnerved by the idea of further monetary\naccommodation in a world where commodity prices inch upward almost on a daily basis and\nlabor costs escalate in Chinese factories, among Indian programmers and all along global supply\nchains.\nI am going to dwell on inflation for a few minutes because I consider it a critical issue. I spoke\nearlier of Churchill’s ship of purpose. As my FOMC colleague Governor Rick Mishkin argues so\neloquently, it is essential that monetary policy firmly anchor inflation expectations. If the Federal\nReserve has an overarching purpose, in my opinion, it is to make sure that anchor stays firmly in\nplace.\n2\n\n“Bernanke Says Sagging Growth Is Chief Concern,” New York Times, Feb. 28, 2008, Edmund L. Andrews, A1.\n3\n\n\fRecent readings on inflation have not been encouraging. The rate of increase in the core personal\nconsumption expenditures price index, or core PCE—that is, what people buy, except food and\nenergy—was 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Yet, its headline counterpart,\nwhich includes food and energy, increased an alarming 3.7 percent over the same time frame.\nBoth core and headline PCE figures have been following an accelerating trajectory over the past\nseveral months. If you annualize the change in the PCE over the most recent three-month period,\nfor example, you’ll notice that the core rose 3 percent, while headline rose 5.4 percent.\nClearly, food and energy prices matter, as these differences make clear. The price index for food\nrose 4.7 percent over the past 12 months, a rate not seen since 1990. Through January, the PCE\nenergy component was up roughly 23 percent over 12 months.\nWhile some of the movement in core consumer price inflation represents pass-through of high\nenergy prices—to transportation services, for example—we have also seen pickups in other\ncomponents, such as recreation, education and personal care services, and upticks in\ncomponents, such as apparel, that have historically exerted downward pressure on the price of\nthe consumer’s basket of goods.\nThere was a time, back when I was an outside observer of the Federal Reserve, when the Fed\npracticed what some have dubbed “opportunistic disinflation.” Beginning in the mid-1980s, the\nFOMC recognized that while recessions sometimes occur, they could not be anticipated with any\nprecision and that by the time the data revealed a recession, it was too late to do much about it,\ngiven the impact lags of monetary policy. The FOMC also recognized that the trend rate of\ninflation generally fell by about a percentage point or more following a recession. Put it all\ntogether and you get opportunistic disinflation, or the idea that if recession comes, make the best\nof it by bringing down the inflation rate.\nThis was a period of persistent disinflation—and, I might add, a period during which the U.S.\neconomy experienced only two short and mild recessions, a total of 16 months over almost 25\nyears. Over this same period, the inflation rate declined inexorably, reaching a point where the\nFOMC had to deal with the threat of deflation in 2003–04. It was also the period when the Fed\nmade the largest gains in its policy credibility.\nOne would like to think that as the economy slows, inflationary pressures will do likewise. But\nwe cannot always be sure they will, given the globalized nature of the U.S. economy. Demandpull pressures abroad have an increasingly potent influence on our domestic economy.\nTraditionally, a central bank would expect slack to develop as the economy under its jurisdiction\nweakened, leading to less demand for most inputs and an easing of price pressures. We no longer\noperate in a traditional economy. Domestic inflation developments have become increasingly\nless sensitive to domestic measures of slack. In an open, globalized economy, capacity utilization\nand inflation pressures need to be measured, or at a minimum, understood in their global context.\nYou cannot think in a purely domestic context about the pricing of oil or steel or soybeans or\npulp or shoes or clothing or even what I consider to be one of life’s essentials, beer, because\ninnovations in transportation and communications technology have all but eliminated national\nborders for almost any product for which trade barriers were negotiated away during the 1980s\nand ’90s. More vexing for economists and econometric modelers, the information technology\n4\n\n\frevolution and the spread of the Internet have blurred the once-clear distinction between easy-totrade goods and difficult-to-trade services. As a result, trade in services is one of the most rapidly\ngrowing components of global trade. Thus, even the available supply of architects or petroleum\nengineers or software designers or medical technicians or lawyers must increasingly be\nconsidered in the context of global rather than domestic demand.\nThe point is that, at present, we simply do not have the ability to adequately account for the\nimpact globalization has on the gearing of our domestic economy. Absent that capacity, we\ncannot, in my opinion, confidently assume that slower U.S. economic growth will quell U.S.\ninflation and, more important, keep inflationary expectations anchored. Containing inflation is\nthe purpose of the ship I crew for, and if a temporary economic slowdown is what we must\nendure while we achieve that purpose, then it is, in my opinion, a burden we must bear, however\npolitically inconvenient.\nTo some, this may appear a Hobson’s choice. I don’t see it that way. Our obligation is to prevent\ninflation in order to sustain long-term employment growth. I believe that the best way to cut\nthrough the treacherous economic waves that are upon us and keep our ship steaming forward is\nto stick to our purpose.\nThat about says it all for tonight. Let me bring this back to London. Recently, the New York\nTimes ran a delightful article on your search for a motto that captures the essence of Britain. My\nfavorite was Nemo me impune lacessit, which loosely translated—according to my Texas\nLatin—means “Never sit on a thistle.” Tonight I may have taken the risk of sitting on the thistle\nof opprobrium of those of you who wished to hear a more felicitous speech. But Charlie Bean’s\nadvice was to “just tell ’em what you think.” That is what I have done, and I thank you for\nallowing me to do so.\nIn the time that remains this evening, I would be happy to take questions and, in true central\nbanking fashion, do my level best to avoid answering them.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nMexico City, Mexico\nFebruary 7, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fDefending Central Bank Independence\nRichard W. Fisher\nGracias por darme la oportunidad de hablar ante ustedes. Para mi estar aquí es como regresar a\ncasa. Yo crecí en la Ciudad de México y, aunque les pueda resultar difícil de creer por lo\nrudimentario de mi español, cursé la primaria aquí, estudiando inglés como segunda lengua.\nTengo un profundo afecto por México y todo lo mexicano. De hecho, debo decir que aprendí\nacerca del Cura Hidalgo y Benito Juárez antes de conocer a George Washington o Abraham\nLincoln. También conocí las culturas maya, tolteca, y azteca antes de estudiar la historia antigua\nde los griegos y romanos en las escuelas estadounidenses. Guardo con mucho afecto estos\nrecuerdos de mi niñez y llevo a México prendado en mi corazón. Es para mi un gran honor\nhablar en este importante recinto, ante esta audiencia de las mentes jóvenes mas brillantes de este\ngran país.\nEsta tarde voy a hablar acerca de lo importante que es tener un banco central independiente.\nTrataré de hacerles ver que un banco central independiente es un elemento lógico y fundamental\nde una economía en buen estado; protege a un gobierno democrático de sus propios demonios.\nCreo firmemente que uno de los más grandes logros del México reciente ha sido la adopción de\nla enmienda constitucional de 1994 que otorga verdadera independencia al Banco de México.\nAfirmo además, que el liderazgo del Gobernador Ortiz ha sido insuperable…bueno, estoy\nobligado a decirlo porque él me va a invitar a cenar al rato y quiero estar seguro de que nos la\nvamos a pasar bien.\nAl final de esta presentación hablaré de asuntos recientes tales como la última reunión del\nComité Federal de Mercado Abierto (FOMC, por sus siglas en inglés). Eso me servirá para\nilustrar, en tiempo real, los retos y desafíos a los que se tienen que enfrentar los bancos centrales\nen cuestión de la política monetaria, especialmente en tiempos de coyuntura económica como los\nque estamos viviendo.\nEsta tarde, como siempre, hablo desde mi propia perspectiva, como presidente de uno de los\ndoce bancos regionales de la Reserva Federal, como una sola voz de entre las 17 que actualmente\nparticipan en las deliberaciones del Comité de Mercado Abierto. No hablo a nombre de ningún\notro oficial de la Reserva Federal, ni a nombre del comité.\nEntiendo que todos ustedes hablan inglés, por lo tanto voy a dejar de torturarlos con mi español,\ny continuar en inglés. Al final, tendremos una sesión de preguntas y respuestas que podremos\nllevar a cabo en cualquiera de los dos idiomas, o incluso en la lengua de mi amada Texas:\nSpanglish.\nLet me start with a refresher course on economics, so that we are all on the same page.\nThe price of a good or service is determined by supply and demand. Too much demand relative\nto supply leads to an increase in the relative price of that good or service. Too little leads to a\nprice decrease. Money and credit are the means by which aggregate demand is managed in the\neconomy. The central banker’s task is to provide the monetary and credit conditions that achieve\n1\n\n\fthe ideal balance between accommodating economic expansion and engendering inflation or\ndeflation.\nThe ultimate task assigned to central banks is to maximize the welfare of the people by providing\nthe monetary conditions for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth. In the long run,\ngrowth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation or deflation. The idea that\nstable prices go hand in hand with achieving sustainable economic growth has led more and\nmore central banks around the world to adopt price stability as their exclusive mandate. Mexico\ntook that view one step further by explicitly writing price stability into the constitutional\namendment that granted Banco de México its independence.\nI submit that the likelihood of achieving sustainable economic growth and keeping inflation at\nbay is best enhanced by having central banks that operate with independence from government\nmeddling.\nEconomic theory generally embraces the idea that a nation’s money supply ought not be directly\ncontrolled by its government because such an arrangement would create a perverse incentive\nstructure that would lead to economic disaster. Printing money, or debasing the currency, to pay\noff government debt is an old concept, noticed by the ancient Greeks and famously practiced by\nthe Romans. In 1824, David Ricardo warned that a government entrusted with the power to issue\nmoney would most certainly abuse it. 1 Like all good economists, Ricardo knew the destructive\ndynamic of printing excess money: The result is inflation, the cruelest form of taxation—\nespecially for the poor and for savers—and the greatest obstacle for entrepreneurs and financiers\nseeking to invest and grow their businesses.\nWe have some glaring examples today of the destruction that can be wrought by governments\nwith direct control over monetary policy. Zimbabwe is the most egregious. A year ago, after\nhaving let monetary printing presses run wild to cover up problems created by misgovernment,\nPresident Mugabe famously declared inflation illegal, promising to arrest and punish anyone\nwho raised prices or wages. Of course, that didn’t work. Just last week it was announced that\nZimbabwe’s inflation reached 26,470 percent in November. The economy of Zimbabwe has been\ndestroyed and its people cast further into poverty as their savings disappear.\nThere are some instructive examples of poor monetary governance in our own hemisphere. In the\ninterest of time, I’ll point to just one case: Venezuela.\nOne would think that Venezuela would be enjoying the prosperity that comes from oil priced\nabove $80 a barrel. But Venezuela’s government has taken effective control of the central bank\nand printed trillions of bolivars to finance ambitious social programs. The result has been an\nofficial inflation rate of 22.7 percent. However, the official figure includes a broad basket of\nitems for which the government has declared price controls, so it is more likely that the real\npurchasing power of the bolivar is being cut in half or more each year. The Venezuelan\nconsumer has been decimated.\nTo counter the inflation the government itself has created, Venezuela recently introduced a new\ncurrency, the “bolivar fuerte,” which is basically the old bolivar with three zeros trimmed off.\n1\n\nRicardo, David, 1824. Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank, Murray, London.\n2\n\n\fSome of your economics professors are old enough to remember when Mexico trimmed zeros off\nthe peso during a time of high inflation. I am sure they will agree that getting rid of all those\nzeros made it easier to do everyday transactions, but the idea that inflation can be brought under\ncontrol simply by dividing all prices and the currency by 1,000 is like believing you can keep a\nroom’s temperature constant by dividing the thermometer marker by two every time the heat\nindex doubles. Marketing gimmicks with new paper money do not lower the heat of inflation;\nthey do not make prices stable. The problem is a lack of economic discipline and bad\ngovernment policies that have undermined sustainable economic growth and destroyed\nVenezuela’s prosperity.\nI think you get the picture. Why do we have independent central banks? To provide a barrier\nbetween government and the money supply. Why is this necessary? Because doing the right\nthing for the long-term interests of the people can be very hard to do. Monetary policymakers\noften have to make decisions that can cause economic pain for real people in the short term, or\ndecide not to do things that could help people out of an immediate bad situation, in order to\npreserve the welfare of the people over the long run.\nThe incentives given to elected officials, even in the most praiseworthy democracies, increase\nthe likelihood of harnessing monetary policy to their political needs. A congressman or a senator\nor a president who has all the best intentions and works earnestly for long-term prosperity is still\nsubject to reelection and would quickly find himself voted out of a job if he tried to implement\nsome of the stern policies that an independent central banker is often required to carry through.\nIt is always easier, for example, to float a weakening economy by loosening the moorings of\nmonetary policy rather than cutting taxes or increasing spending. It is easier to allow inflation to\nfinance ambitious social programs or bail out a government from the burden of debt. Forgive me\nfor invoking Greek mythology and the work of Homer, but governments often fall victim to the\nSiren call of monetary accommodation. But with an independent central bank, a government, like\nOdysseus, can tie itself to the mast and commit to the best policy course for the long haul. Aware\nof the perilous fate that awaits those who succumb to the Sirens, a wise government can direct its\ncentral bankers to stuff beeswax in their ears and ignore the seductive calls of powerful interests\nthat demand accommodation to satisfy immediate political needs. Undistracted by political\nmotivation, the central bank can focus exclusively on piloting economic policy on a consistent\ncourse toward sustainable, noninflationary growth.\nAn independent central bank thus occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government\ninstitutions. Properly designed, it will pursue a deliberate and steady course, untainted by the\npassion of the moment and immune to political exigency and influence. Governments bestow\nindependence upon their central banks once they realize that the best approach to monetary\npolicymaking is a clearly defined mandate for price stability and noninflationary economic\ngrowth, applied consistently from administration to administration, year to year, decade to\ndecade, generation to generation.\nTo understand the rewards that come from having an independent central bank able to block out\nthe Siren calls and focus on price stability, the world need only look here to Mexico. Mexico can\nboast today of an inflation rate that by some measures is even lower than that of the U.S. Mexico\nhas managed two presidential transitions without a peso crisis. Mexican financial markets now\nhave the credibility to issue debt in pesos up to 30 years at less than 8 percent, whereas only a\n3\n\n\fdecade ago the longest maturity horizon for Mexican government debt was one year at over 20\npercent. The yield curve for Mexico has been extended, and Mexican businesses and consumers\ncan now borrow in pesos longer term, enabling the development of crucial infrastructure, such as\nhousing stock. Foreigners can now invest in Mexico without fear of significant peso\ndevaluations.\nThis is not the Mexico I grew up in. Today, the Mexican people have greater wherewithal to\nrealize their dreams. Mexican leaders have earned some impressive bragging rights: Two weeks\nago in Davos, as the various leaders assembled there were bemoaning the financial crisis\npresently afflicting global credit markets, Governor Ortiz, looking back to the Tequila Crisis and\nother episodes, exclaimed that “this time, it wasn’t us.”\nMexico would not be in this proud position today had your government not amended the\nconstitution in 1994 to create a fully independent central bank with price stability as its main\ngoal. Banco de México has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting, rightfully\nearning the respect of the international investment and monetary policy communities. And here\ncomes the flattering part that I hope will earn me a nice dinner with Governor Ortiz: It is widely\naccepted in central banking circles that under his direction, Banco de México has become one of\nthe most highly regarded central banks in the world.\nIt requires more than just a law bestowing independence upon a central bank for the bank to\nactually be independent. It also requires that it be independent in practice. By definition, for a\ncentral bank to be independent, it must possess the ability to define its policy objectives without\npolitical pressure and it must be free to use its policy instruments without constraints. This is\neasier said than done.\nWe know from our own experience at the Federal Reserve that in times of duress, Congress or\nthe executive branch can interfere with the workings of a central bank with disastrous\nconsequences. In the 1960s, a populist congressman from East Texas named Wright Patman,\nwho was chairman of the House Banking Committee, launched a comprehensive review of the\nFederal Reserve System that exacted an enormous strain on the System’s staff and resources.\nCongressman Patman was convinced that, contrary to David Ricardo, “money need[ed] to be\nback in politics where it was in the 19th century.” 2 He wanted to legislate away the Fed’s\nindependence and turn it into an arm of the executive branch. Patman’s investigation had reached\na point where the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks and the Washington-based Board of\nGovernors could no longer focus on economic analysis or other functions. Complying with\nPatman’s congressional subpoenas was keeping the Fed from doing its job.\nAt the same time, President Lyndon Johnson was escalating the U.S. military presence in\nVietnam and spending a pretty penny to do so; federal defense expenditures rose to over 10\npercent of GDP, more than double the burden of U.S. military spending today. Johnson needed\nto finance that spending and felt that the Federal Reserve could provide funds cheaply by\nkeeping interest rates low. The Federal Reserve had a real dilemma. It could cut a deal with\nPresident Johnson, who, as the most powerful Texan, could call Patman off, but at the price of\n\n2\n\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. William McChesney Martin Collection. Box 163; Folder: “Martin\nAddresses (5) April 1962 to July 1964.”\n4\n\n\fsurrendering Fed policy independence to Johnson’s desires; or it could continue to endure the\nPatman investigation and risk the Fed’s charter and long-run institutional independence.\nI should note that whether the then-chairman of the Fed, a very talented and honorable man\nnamed William McChesney Martin, and Johnson made a deal is a matter of speculation. Such an\nagreement would not have been documented if it did exist. What is known is that Chairman\nMartin met with Johnson at the White House in May 1964, and soon thereafter the Patman\nhearings unceremoniously ended without any legislation amending the Federal Reserve’s\nstanding. The Fed held interest rates mostly unchanged over the next 19 months—until\nDecember 1965—despite mounting inflation fueled by government spending.\nU.S. government budget deficits continued to grow, reaching their highest relative levels on\nrecord in the 1970s. Sadly, the Fed monetized these deficits for several years during the 1960s\nunder Martin’s chairmanship and in the 1970s under his successors, Chairmen Arthur Burns and\nWilliam Miller. By 1979, inflation had jumped to 14 percent and the prime rate reached 20\npercent.\nThe Federal Reserve managed to regain control of the economy and its own independence under\nthe firm leadership of Paul Volcker. But the cure for high inflation was a dose of harsh medicine.\nA severe recession ensued, followed by years of high unemployment and high interest rates.\nMonetary decisions made for short-term political gain exacted a heavy toll on the American\npeople.\nThe Siren call for monetary accommodation to address political ends is universal and can seduce\nany leader. Whether you live in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Mexico, the United States or anywhere\nelse, maintaining true central bank independence is required for achieving long-term economic\nprosperity. The Federal Reserve and Banco de México can best preserve our charters and the\nsacred trust of the people by doing what we have been assigned to do: remain focused on making\nmonetary policy that achieves long-term sustainable noninflationary growth. The future\nprosperity of our two countries depends upon it.\nWhich brings us to the present situation.\nUnder Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has been left alone to\nconduct monetary policy. We are a truly independent central bank. Policy is set by the Federal\nOpen Market Committee. The 17 current participants in the FOMC deliberations consist of five\ngovernors, including the chairman, who are appointed by the president of the United States and\nconfirmed by the Senate, and 12 presidents of the Fed’s regional Banks, each of whom serves at\nthe pleasure of his or her Bank’s board of directors. All 17 participate in honest and vigorous\ndiscussion of the economy and each offers his or her individual policy prescription at FOMC\nmeetings convened and presided over by the chairman. At the end of these meetings, the\nchairman calls for a vote. All the governors vote every year and five of the presidents vote under\na rotation system so that different presidents vote year by year. This year, I have the privilege of\nbeing one of the five voting presidents.\nAt the last meeting of the FOMC, I voted against lowering the federal funds rate—the target rate\nwe set for banks to loan overnight money to each other—from 3.5 percent to 3 percent. The\n5\n\n\fminutes of that meeting will be released on Feb. 20, 2008. It would be inappropriate for me to\ndiscuss the deliberations; however, I can give you a perspective.\nI spoke earlier of William McChesney Martin. He famously said that the job of a good central\nbanker is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going. For the past few years, we\nhave had a raucous party of economic growth fueled by an intoxicating brew of credit market\npractices that financed a housing boom of historic, and late in the cycle, hysteric, proportions.\nWith the benefit of perfect hindsight, some have argued that the Fed failed to take away the\npunchbowl as the subprime party spun out of control, leaving rates too low for too long and not\nusing our regulatory powers to restrain excessive complacency in the pricing and monitoring of\nrisk. But that is beside the point.\nNow we are faced with the consequences of a process that lawyers would call the “discovery\nphase”: As big banks and other financial agents confess their acts of fiduciary omission and\nexcesses of commission, credit markets have effectively de-leveraged important segments of the\neconomy, slowing growth suddenly and precipitously. Instead of taking the punchbowl away, the\nFederal Reserve is now faced with the task of replenishing the punch.\nYet at the same time, we are faced with the unprecedented consequence of demand-pull\ninflationary forces fueled by the voracious consumption of oil, wheat, corn, iron ore, steel and\ncopper, and all other kinds of commodities and inputs, including labor, among the 3 billion new\nparticipants in the global economy. When it comes to these precious inputs, we have no control\nover the surging demand from China, India, Brazil, the countries of the former Soviet Union and\nother new growth centers, but we know that it is putting upward pressure on prices in our\neconomy. Economists note that the “income elasticity of demand” for food is higher in China\nand other emerging economies than in the United States. Many of these countries’ income\nelasticity of demand for oil and certain other vital commodities is greater than 1, meaning that\ntheir demand for these items will increase faster than their income. Even if growth slows\nsomewhat in some of these important emerging economies—the World Bank, for example,\nprojects China’s growth will be 9.6 percent in 2008, down from 11 percent last year—demand\nfor inputs relative to the world’s ability to supply them will likely continue to exert upward\npressure on key commodity prices.\nWe also know that the inflationary expectations of consumers and business leaders are impacted\nby what they pay for gasoline at the pump and food at the grocery store.\nMonetary policy acts with a lag. I liken it to a good single malt whiskey or perhaps truly great\ntequila: It takes time before you feel its full effect. The Fed has to be very careful now to add just\nthe right amount of stimulus to the punchbowl without mixing in the potential to juice up\ninflation once the effect of the new punch kicks in.\nWe have been hard at work trying to find the right mixture. Before the meeting last week, we had\nreduced the fed funds rate by 175 basis points in 18 weeks—cuts that I supported even though I\ndid not have a formal vote. During that time, we also initiated a new system for term money that\nhas auctioned $100 billion at rates below the official discount rate.\nMy dissenting vote last week was simply a difference of opinion about how far and how fast we\nmight re-spike the monetary punchbowl. Given that I had yet to see a mitigation in inflation and\n6\n\n\finflationary expectations from their current high levels, and that I believed the steps we had\nalready taken would be helpful in mitigating the downside risk to growth once they took full\neffect, I simply did not feel it was the proper time to support additional monetary\naccommodation.\nI respect the majority view of the committee. I sleep well at night knowing that the collective\nwisdom of the group is guided by one common goal: the continued prosperity of the American\npeople.\nBueno amigos míos, así es la vida de los que hacemos la política monetaria. Gracias por darme la\noportunidad de platicar con ustedes. Ha sido un gran placer. Espero que ahora que conocen más\nacerca de lo importante que es tener un banco central independiente, puedan salir de aquí\norgullosos del papel que juega el Banco de México en el desarrollo económico de este gran país.\nPor mi parte, después de contestar a sus preguntas, voy a taparme los oídos con cera, amarrarme\nal mástil, y esperar que el distinguido Gobernador Ortiz me ofrece unos tragos del “ponche”.\nUna vez más, gracias por su atención.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "Challenges for Monetary Policy\nin a Globalized Economy\nRemarks before the Global Interdependence Center\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fChallenges for Monetary Policy in a Globalized Economy\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Charlie [Plosser]. I am grateful for the invitation to speak to the Global\nInterdependence Center.\nI am going to take advantage of this podium to provide the Dallas Fed’s point of view, from a\nglobal perspective, on the issue that preoccupies President Plosser and me and our colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). That issue is the conduct of monetary policy\ngiven our current economic predicament. If you will indulge me, we can address other issues of\nglobal interdependence in the Q&A session. Before I get started, let me go on record as having\nsaid that, as always, I speak today only for myself and not for the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, its members or the Federal Reserve System.\nFirst, a word about Philadelphia. I spent a tad more than my Fed per diem last night and stayed at\nthe Ritz Carlton at Broad and Chestnut. Before it became a hotel, that monumental building\nhoused the old Girard Trust Company. True Philadelphians know the rock-solid financial legacy\nof Stephen Girard. In 1811, he bought the remaining shares in the First Bank of the United States\nand renamed it Girard’s Bank. History footnotes Girard’s Bank as the key financial backer of the\nU.S. during the War of 1812. According to one estimate, the value of Girard’s net worth at his\ndeath in 1831 was roughly $2 trillion in today’s dollars. Imagine: Girard made Warren Buffett\nlook like a piker! He and his bank were so financially solid that the saying “In Girard we trust”\nwas later morphed into the Girard Trust Company.\nIt was Girard Trust that took an interest in me in 1963 and gave my family the means to send me\nfar from home to a New Jersey boarding school. I never quite learned why they treated me so\nkindly, but I do remember my father saying that Girard had a soft spot for wayward boys from\n“challenged” backgrounds who might—just might—have some potential for salvation. I would\nnever have accumulated all those honors mentioned in President Plosser’s introduction, nor\nwould I have had the good life I have enjoyed, nor would I be addressing you today as a Federal\nReserve Bank president, had it not been for Girard Trust.\nSo I slept well last night in the bosom of that solid old building that was once a pillar of financial\nrectitude—a rare luxury for a policymaker in these fitful times.\nYou’d be hard pressed to find an economist or market operator in this city or anywhere else on\nthe planet who is not concerned about waning U.S. economic growth. Some analysts and\ncommentators sound like Chicken Littles. Others are less excitable, but are nevertheless\nassuming a defensive crouch. Most are mindful of recent developments in employment patterns,\nuneven retail sales and downward shifts in shipping, rail and trucking indexes, industrial activity,\nbusiness capex plans, credit card payables, purchasing manager activity and other carefully\nwatched indicators. These stresses follow on the severe housing downturn and the liquidity bind.\nThere is an increasingly insistent drumbeat urging the Fed not only to not impose contractionary\npolicy on a weakening economy, but indeed to get “ahead of the curve” through further monetary\naccommodation.\n1\n\n\fChairman Bernanke spoke last week and made it clear that the FOMC stands “ready to take\nsubstantive action needed to support growth and provide insurance against downside risks,”\nadding that “additional policy easing may well be necessary.” In short, he made clear that the\nFOMC does not intend to just squat and wait should economic data and sound risk management\nsignal that monetary accommodation is required.\nIt needs to be underscored that being proactive and not passive in doing our job does not mean\nthat we will abandon prudent decisionmaking. We are the central bank of the United States, the\nbellwether economy of the world. Our job is not to bail out imprudent decisionmakers or errant\nbankers, nor is it to directly support the stock market or to somehow make whole those money\nmanagers, financial engineers and real estate speculators who got it wrong. And it most\ndefinitely is not to err on the side of Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.\nIn fact, to benefit Main Street, we have a duty to maintain a financial system that enables\nAmerican capitalism to do its magic. To this end, we have recently taken steps designed to\ncircumvent bottlenecks in interbank lending—steps that include changing the operation of our\ndiscount window and opening a new term auction facility. This facility has provided $70 billion\nin funds in roughly a month and will soon provide another $30 billion, and perhaps even more\nover time if needed.\nIn setting broader monetary policy and the fed funds target rate, the Fed operates under a dual\nmandate. We are charged by Congress with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable,\nnoninflationary employment growth. Put more simply, our mandate is to grow employment and\nto contain inflation. Unstable prices are incompatible with sustainable job growth. Some critics\nworry that we have forgotten that axiom. We haven’t.\nLet me give you my personal view.\nIn discharging our dual mandate, we must be mindful that short-term fixes often lead to longterm problems. The Fed occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government institutions. It\nwas deliberately designed to be calm and steady, untainted by the passion of the moment and\nimmune to political exigency and influence. Because monetary policy’s effects spread into the\neconomy slowly and accumulate over time, having an itchy trigger finger with monetary policy\nrisks shooting everyone in the foot. Our policy mandate must be discharged with careful and\ndeliberate aim.\nIn the attention-deficit world of television and Internet commentary, where so-called “instant\nanalysis”—an oxymoron if there ever was one—makes headlines, it is easy to understand why\none might think that the effect of a change in the fed funds rate would immediately alter the\ndynamic of the economy. To be sure, movement in the fed funds rate, or even no movement at\nall, may have an immediate psychological effect and influence expectations for future monetary\npolicy action. But the act of changing or not changing the fed funds target rate, in and of itself,\nhas no immediate effect on the economy. Like a good single malt whiskey, the ameliorating or\nstimulating influence kicks in only with a lag.\nThe lag time necessary for inflation to respond to policy is especially long. As a policymaker\ndischarging our dual mandate, I am always mindful that in providing the monetary conditions for\nemployment growth, we must not also sow the seeds of inflation that will eventually choke off\n2\n\n\fthe very employment growth we seek to encourage. You do not have to be an inflation “hawk” to\nrecognize that would be a Faustian bargain.\nThose of you who follow my speeches—probably a very small number of you with way too\nmuch time on your hands—will recall that I like neither the term “hawk” nor “dove.” I like to\nthink that all FOMC members are best metaphorically described in ornithological terms as\n“owls”—wise women and men seeking to achieve the right balance in carrying out our dual\nmandate. To be owlish, and to avoid the imbalance of emphasis that gave rise to needed harsh\ndiscipline imposed by the Volcker FOMC, one has to bear in mind that the seeds of inflation,\nonce planted, can lie fallow for some time, then suddenly burst through the economic topsoil like\nkudzu, requiring a near-toxic dose of countermeasures to overcome.\nIn the pre-Volcker era, the Fed had a less-than-admirable record of keeping inflation at bay. But\nover the past few decades, we have done well enough to both contain inflation and engender\ngrowth that far outpaced other advanced economies for a sustained period with only a smattering\nof short recessions. In short, the Fed has delivered on its mandate.\nTo be sure, we have been profoundly impacted by the shifting economic dynamics that have\ncomplicated our efforts to continue delivering on our mandate. I need not try to convince\nmembers and supporters of the Global Interdependence Center that we are living in a globalized\nworld. Increasingly, globalization is blurring economic boundaries. On the inflation front, for\nexample, we have extensive economic playbooks that tell us how to treat the wage–price spiral\nor cost-push forces in a closed economy. In a closed environment, one would ordinarily expect\nthat a weakening economy would lead, in turn, to a diminution in price pressures. But we have\nless experience with prescribing policy in an open economy where demand-pull forces come\nfrom beyond our borders—such as the burgeoning demand for commodities and food from\nrapidly growing and newly consequential economies like China, India, Latin America and the\ncountries liberated from the oppression of Soviet communism. These faraway places play an\never-increasing role in determining prices here at home.\nWriting in last Sunday’s New York Times, Ben Stein noted this and that the Fed does not have\nmuch power to influence the price of oil. 1 He is right. And for that matter, we can’t do much\nabout the external demand impacting the price of food—which, by the way, carries twice the\nweight of energy in the consumer basket of personal consumption expenditures. But the\ndynamics of production and demand among the new participants in the global economy\nnonetheless impact us in different ways at different times. As these new participants joined the\nglobal economy, they provided significant tailwinds, helping us grow by providing cost savings,\nnew sources of productivity enhancement and new sources of demand, helping fatten both the\ntop line and bottom line of our businesses while also holding down inflation. Under such\nconditions, the Fed could operate with a more accommodative monetary policy than what might\nhave been appropriate in a closed economy, without putting upward pressure on inflation. And\nthat is what the Fed did, although some argue—with the benefit of hindsight—it did so for too\nlong.\nI think it is now clear that the winds have shifted. The growing appetite for raw inputs from the\nnew participants in the global economy represents an inflationary headwind that is unlikely to\n1\n\n“Larry, Curly, Moe and the Economy,” The New York Times, page BU4, January 13, 2008.\n3\n\n\fsoon abate. The so-called “income elasticity of demand” for energy is 1.2 across a wide range of\ncountries, which is a fancy way of saying that economic theory should lead one to conclude that\nthe demand for energy in, say, China, for example, would begin to grow faster than China’s\nincome growth, which continues to increase at a rapid rate. Put more simply, income growth in\nChina and India and elsewhere, even if it slows from its torrid pace, is likely to continue raising\ndemand for food and energy. There is a risk that upward price pressures will continue to affect\nAmerican producers and consumers of energy and food products and a continuing danger that\noverall inflation expectations will drift upward as a result.\nIf I am correct, then the situation today is the flip side of the 1990s and early 2000s: In delivering\non our mandate to be monetary policy “owls,” we will have to err on the side of running tighter\npolicy than would otherwise be justified if we wish to limit upward inflation pressures.\nI mentioned single malt whiskey earlier to describe the effective time lags of monetary policy. I\nrealize it is only lunchtime, but let’s return to the economics liquor cabinet for a moment.\nInflation is like absinthe. The narcotic allure of inflation is a dangerous thing. It might seem like\nthe remedy to bail out a government or a bad book of business and forget your troubles. Yet our\nexperience in the past has taught us only too well that inflation is a dangerous elixir that\nultimately proves debilitating for businesses, consumers, investors—including those foreign\ninvestors who have lately come to the aid of some large balance sheets here—and especially for\nthe poor, the elderly and people on fixed incomes. It even inculcates bad financial behavioral\npatterns in the young by encouraging spending rather than investment and saving. Inflation is\nbad for Main Street and Wall Street and even for Sesame Street.\nYet we central bankers also traverse Lombard Street, and we know from Walter Bagehot that in\ntimes of crisis, liquidity is key. As a voter on the FOMC this year, I stand ready to take\nsubstantive action to support growth and provide insurance against downside risk, as long as\ninflation expectations remain contained.\nYou will note the operative qualifying words there were “as long as inflation expectations remain\ncontained.” Each of us looks to different indicators for a sense of inflation’s direction. Some\nperuse markets for signs of shifting expectations, looking, say, to the yield on Treasury InflationProtected Securities, or TIPS, or to the spread between yields in the forward markets between\nTIPS and nominal Treasuries at different points of the yield curve or all along the entire curve.\nPersonally, as a former market operator, I am wary of relying on Treasury spot or futures\nindicators during a flight to quality or at times when liquidity is at a premium, as investors may\nhave other preoccupations that trump or distort conventional inflation concerns.\nOthers look to surveys of consumers and professional forecasters, like those conducted by the\nUniversity of Michigan and the Philadelphia Fed. The latest, the University of Michigan survey,\nreleased in December, is forecasting headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 3.4\npercent, which is hardly comforting. The Philadelphia Fed survey, released last November,\nprovides a more palatable forecast of 2.4 percent for the next four quarters; yet if you plot that\nsurvey against actual headline inflation obtained for the last four years, it has more often than not\nunderestimated inflation’s true path.\nThe brow of a central banker considering further accommodation furrows further when looking\nat the inflation measures that form the basis for Main Street’s inflationary expectations—the CPI\n4\n\n\fand the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator. On a 12-month basis, the most\nrecent CPI, released yesterday, was running at a rate of 4.1 percent. The last PCE deflator,\nreleased in December, was 3.6 percent. The Trimmed Mean PCE Deflator, which the Dallas Fed\ntracks in an effort to eliminate “noise from signal” and as a basis for projecting inflation, is no\nlonger trending downward. Even the so-called “Core PCE,” which I personally consider least\nuseful because it eliminates food and energy prices, is rising rather than declining.\nOf course, what matters most is the future direction of inflation, not the past. In the course of\npreparing for each FOMC meeting, I regularly consult directly with some 30-plus CEOs to\ndevelop a sense of future business activity, including cost and pricing developments. I have\nfound this rigorous exercise to be extremely helpful in placing our staff’s econometric analysis in\ncontext as I have prepared for FOMC meetings in the past, and I will be listening especially\ncarefully to these business operators’ reports on inflation-related developments as I prepare for\nupcoming FOMC meetings.\nIn my view, the degree of substantive action to support economic growth and insure against\ndownside risk will be conditioned by what we see coming down the inflation pike. To deliver on\nits dual mandate, the Fed must keep one ear cocked toward signs that inflationary expectations\nare drifting upward as we execute additional monetary measures.\nLet me bring this home to Philadelphia. In 1748, Benjamin Franklin wrote an “Advice to a\nYoung Tradesman.” In it, he speaks in the language of the day of the concepts of opportunity\ncost and of the power of compound interest—pretty precocious stuff for those times. Of the\nmoney supply, he wrote that “the more there is of it, the more it produces [at] every turning, so\nthat the profits rise quicker and quicker.” Yet he also warns in earthy terms of the dangers of\nbeing too prolific. “He that kills a breeding sow,” Franklin warned, “destroys all her offspring to\nthe thousandth generation. He that murders a crown [the currency of the day], destroys all that it\nmight have produced….”\nThe late Dame Mary Douglas was no Ben Franklin. Nor was she a Philadelphian. She was a\nbrilliant British economic anthropologist who wrote a pathbreaking book titled Purity and\nDanger. In it, she wrote something that Franklin or Stephen Girard or any good central banker\nsince the onset of time has understood implicitly: “Money can only perform its role of\nintensifying economic interaction if the public has faith in it. If that faith is shaken, the currency\nis useless.”\nLike Charlie and my other colleagues, I have every desire to use monetary policy to intensify\neconomic interaction, to keep breeding jobs and growing our economy, so that we might keep\nAmerica strong to the thousandth generation. I have no intention of being party to any action that\nmight shake faith in the dollar. The challenge to monetary policy, as I see it, is to achieve the\ngrowth part of our mandate in the short term and get “ahead of the curve” without shaking faith\nin the currency over the long term.\nI know that the GIC has other things on its mind than just monetary policy. So let me stop there\nand answer any questions you might have.\n\n5\n\n\f"

            "content": "The U.S. Economy, Globalization\nand Inflation Measurement\n(With Brief References to Brawls,\nBeer and Bikinis)\nRemarks before the Australian Business Economists\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nSydney, Australia\nNovember 14, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe U.S. Economy, Globalization and Inflation Measurement\n(With Brief Reference to Brawls, Beer and Bikinis)\nRichard W. Fisher\nThere is a map in the library of our home in Texas that charts the sea-lanes that my ancestors and\nthose of my wife took to the United States. Nancy is a direct descendant on her father’s side of\nJohn Knox; her brother is named Michael Collins; her mother’s ancestors are listed in the\nDomesday Book. It comes as no surprise that her Scotch/Irish/English family sailed directly\nacross the Atlantic to America.\nMy family sailed through different waters. My ancestors had a penchant for migrating first to the\nantipodes of the Southern Hemisphere. My mother’s parents sailed from Norway to South Africa\nto whale and to mine in the late 1800s and never went home. My father’s ancestors came here to\nAustralia from a far different place on the English landscape than the one occupied by Nancy’s.\nWe do not know when the Fishers came to Australia. Nor do we know if they came of their own\nfree will. We do know that my father, Leslie, was born in Toowoomba in 1904, was abandoned\nby his mother and was poorly kept by his luckless father. In January of 1910, at the age of 6, he\nwas picked up sleeping on the doorstep of a bakery while his father was off begging for food.\nThus began an exotic “walkabout” that ended happily in America.\nIn 1999, when I was negotiating the first stages of the U.S.–Australia Bilateral Trade Agreement\nas an ambassador and trade representative of the U.S. government, Canberra gave me what could\nbe gathered of my father’s files. They include a letter from the director of the State Children’s\nDepartment of Queensland to the officer in charge of the Toowoomba police, dated April 4,\n1913. It reads as follows: “Leslie Fisher (was placed) under State control as a neglected child to\nour care by the Police Magistrate … in January 1910. [His] father had no place of abode and was\nliving from hand to mouth.” It goes on to inquire of the police whether Leslie Fisher, my father,\n“has a home of his own, or is he living with any person in the locality?” My dad was then 9 years\nold.\nTo our knowledge, the director never got an answer back. My father had disappeared, first into\nan orphanage, then to a series of rather harsh foster homes, then to the streets, where he, too,\nsurvived from hand to mouth as a street urchin until 1921, when at age 17 he was taken in as an\n“apprentice mechanic” at the firm of Foster and Dutton.\nHe swept the floors and worked a lathe, earning barely enough for food and clothing. At night,\nhe slept on the factory floor. Shortly before he died at the age of 90—he was a tough old buzzard\nwho kept all his marbles until he drew his last breath—he told me about the afternoon he\naccompanied his employer to a meeting in a hotel in Brisbane. Mr. Dutton ordered tea and tipped\nthe waiter more than he paid my father in a month. It was then and there, my father told me, that\nhe decided he would make something of himself, but that first he had to escape his past.\nIn February of 1924, at age 20, he sailed for South Africa—we don’t know if he somehow paid\nhis passage or simply stowed away—where he found work as a bus driver in Jo’Berg and\n1\n\n\feventually found my mother. Once they had saved enough, they sailed for America and the\ngolden shores of California in 1939.\nBut America would not immediately have him. The United States was willing to admit my\nmother but not my dad. And so they shuttled between Los Angeles and Tijuana, a few hundred\nmiles south just over the border on the Mexican side. Dad did what he needed to make a living,\nselling cars in California and beating the bookies at the then-famous Tijuana Race Track—a skill\nhe no doubt honed as a street gambler and “two-up” champion back in Queensland. The U.S.\nauthorities admitted him and my mother to U.S. citizenship in 1947.\nThe story gets richer still. In 1948, on the eve of the Red Army’s entry into Shanghai, my father\nwas hired to sail to that city to “collect” a payment a Chinese company owed a firm called\nSpazier Chemical and Soap. My mother and two brothers went with him. After a bit of time and\neffort, he succeeded in collecting the money, and they sailed out on the S.S. President Wilson\nback to Los Angeles. It was one of the last ships to leave Shanghai before China’s troops closed\ndown all passage. They brought back more than what was due Spazier Chemical: They brought\nme. I was born eight months after the Wilson left China.\nIncidentally, 50 years later, when I was helping negotiate the U.S. side of the deal to bring China\ninto the World Trade Organization, Madam Wu Yi, who oversaw China’s team, told me I must\nhave gotten my luck in life from being “Made in China.”\nSoon after I was born, we moved to Mexico City, where I received my primary school education,\nand from there began the serendipitous life that was more than generously summarized by Tony\nRichards in that kind introduction.\nAlthough he led a rough life here, my father taught us to be proud of our Aussie heritage. He said\nhe was just an example of the tenacity of Australians. “They are the best brawlers and fighters in\nthe world,” he would say. And, for puckish good measure, he would add, “and they love beer and\nbikinis.”\nI am the product of an Australian walkabout of epic proportion, a testimony to the fact that\nAustralians are the hardiest of peoples. I understand you have heard from some of my Fed\ncolleagues via satellite, but I am very proud, as a son of an archetypically hardy Australian, to be\nthe first representative of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) of the U.S. Federal\nReserve System to address the Australian Business Economists in person. Thank you, Robert\n[Henderson], for inviting me here.\nI have recited this long and bizarre history not just out of familial pride, but because I know\nsome among you feel the U.S. is a bit closed-minded about globalization and tends to think\nmyopically—either because we are so bloody large or by virtue of having been a pretty-much\nself-contained economic powerhouse for so long. I was “assembled” in China from\nEnglish/Australian and Norwegian/South African parts, was “programmed” in Mexico and\nrealized my “value added” in the United States. You can’t get much more globalized than that!\nMany of the governors and fellow bank presidents I serve with on the FOMC may have less\ncomplicated backgrounds, but they also get the picture: The economy in which we set monetary\n2\n\n\fpolicy is entirely different from that of our FOMC forbearers, placing new demands on our skill\nsets.\nI will focus my comments tonight on the current state of the U.S. economy. Having just invoked\nmy colleagues, I should mention, as I always do, that my comments this evening are in no way\nthe official position of the U.S. Federal Reserve or the FOMC. They are my views, and mine\nalone.\nRecent Developments in the U.S. Credit Markets\nYou are all well aware of the events that began to rattle the credit markets in August. Indeed, the\nmedia and analyst coverage of the market turbulence has been so extensive that you would have\nhad to have gotten lost on the walking tour around Ayers Rock last July and just now found your\nway back to civilization to be unaware of subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations\n(CDOs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and the write-downs taken by several leading\nfinancial institutions. The disruptions to the orderly functioning of the financial markets have\nbeen significant, and the Fed and other central banks around the world have acted to keep those\nmarkets functioning. Beyond the troubles in financial markets, we have had an otherwise healthy\neconomy in the U.S., with, thus far, the only other significant signs of weakening coming from\ncontinual corrections in the housing market.\nThe Federal Reserve took action in mid-August, first lowering the discount rate by a half\npercentage point at a specially convened session of the FOMC, making clear we, like all learned\ncentral bankers, had read Walter Bagehot. Then, at our regular September meeting, we cut the\nfederal funds rate by a half percentage point and the discount rate by the same amount. By the\ntime we met again on October 30 and 31, the hardening of the arteries or the blocking of the\naorta, or whatever cardiovascular analogy you choose to describe what was afflicting the\ncirculatory system of the credit markets, was no longer as severe and life threatening as it was in\nAugust. Indeed, investors had begun moving toward marking financial assets and exposures to\nmarket—pricing them according to what they might actually be bought or sold for—rather than\nat values posited by hypothetical mathematical models.\nA startling statement appeared in the Financial Times on October 26: A particularly astute\nmarket operator commented that “corporate treasurers are no longer investing in things they\ndon’t understand.” Imagine that! Investors are coming home from la la land. To be sure, they are\nnot out of the woods quite yet, and they have miles to go before they, and we as central bankers,\nsleep. But they have gone beyond suspended reality. You might say the credit markets have gone\nfrom the ridiculous to the subprime; the subprime and related derivatives market is the focus of\nangst, but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset classes appears\nto be in remission, if not over.\nWe have a way to go before full recovery and must acknowledge that shocks and accidents might\nhappen. Phrasing it politely, as an Aussie-Texan, I suspect some real “cow patties” remain in\nsome prominent institutional punchbowls in the U.S. and abroad, and they will undoubtedly\ncome to light before too long. I would submit, however, that we are on our way back to markets\npriced by reason rather than fantasy and that systemic risk has been lessened substantially.\n\n3\n\n\fWhile the Federal Reserve remains ready to act if needed—as we have hopefully made clear by\nour actions and statements—I believe it was appropriate for the FOMC to focus squarely on the\neconomy at its October 30 and 31 meeting.\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy\nAt 11 o’clock tomorrow morning Dallas time, the U.S. economy will officially be entering its\nseventh year of expansion. Here is how I view our economic situation from my perch at the\nDallas Fed. To begin, one has to take account of the corrections from a long period of excessive\ninflation of the U.S. housing stock. The sharp turnaround in mortgage availability will influence\nconsumer spending by affecting both the amount of household wealth and the ability of\nhomeowners to tap that wealth. Because mortgage availability has changed so much so quickly,\nthe precise effect of this change is hard to gauge and is thus worrisome. Yet, it may also be\nsubject to overstatement, given the Fed’s response. The overstatement may also be partly due to\nthe news media’s penchant for “instant analysis”—my favorite oxymoron, akin to jumbo shrimp\nor nonalcoholic beer—which tends to focus on the downside. The flexibility and recuperative\npower of our extraordinarily adaptive economy creates a dynamic often overlooked by\npessimistic pundits and even some thoughtful economists. My soundings find no appreciable, let\nalone debilitating, signs of spillover into the rest of the economy as yet. To be sure, the economy\nhas been weakened, but it has not shown signs of succumbing to the full-blown virus infecting\nhousing.\nGoing back to January, and even more so since the spring, banks in my district and elsewhere\nhave reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households, and the\noverall mood of the country as reported by the press is sour. Yet, we haven’t seen sharp increases\nin initial jobless claims, dangerously low Purchasing Managers Index readings or persistent\ndeclines in durable goods orders. The service sector—which people too often forget accounts for\n83 percent of the U.S. economy versus 11 percent for manufacturing, 5 percent for construction\nand mining, and 2 percent for agriculture—remains strong and productive. Indeed, economic\ngrowth was robust enough in the first estimate of third quarter growth to ring in at 3.9 percent. In\nan economy the size of the U.S., that means we added over $150 billion in output from July\nthrough September—a lot of new economic activity. What we added to GDP in just one threemonth period exceeds the total annual output of your neighbor New Zealand by 50 percent!\nHouseholds are still reasonably optimistic, although perhaps a bit more cautious, about their job\nprospects, and consumer spending continues to grow at a decent clip. There remain widespread\nreports of labor shortages all across the country. This is especially the case in Texas, where over\n247,000 net new jobs have been created year to date, representing between 15 and 20 percent of\nthe jobs created in the entire U.S. this year.\nThe bottom line? A fat left tail where some risk of substandard growth is clearly on the growth\nprobability curve, but the more likely outcome is for the U.S. economy to continue to expand at a\nsustainable pace.\nIn part, this is due to service sector strength, infrastructure and durable goods spending that is\nrunning better than expected, fiscal stimulus and strong export performance. U.S. overseas sales\nhave been propelled by increasing demand and facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar. We\n4\n\n\fmeet tonight as the trade-weighted dollar skates along a post-Bretton Woods low—not an easy\nthing for a strong-dollar man to note.\nCertainly, some risk remains that downward momentum will emerge. Personally, I worry about\nthe plight of big population states like Florida and California, where the housing correction is\nhaving its severest impact. I note the reports issued by express shippers and ground\ntransportation firms that show deceleration in year-over-year trends in pre-holiday traffic across\nthe nation. I realize that Wal-Mart and other large retailers have seen a slowing in same-store\nsales growth, that shopping mall traffic is down, and that the restaurant business—a notinsignificant part of the service sector that employs 14 million Americans—is showing signs of\nstrain as customers migrate from casual dining to more affordable fast-food providers. And, if\nyou parse the data for the third quarter, you will see a pretty stout guesstimate of inventory\naccumulation. These are prototypical signs of an economy in stress.\nYet, before each FOMC meeting, I consult 35 CEOs from a broad range of businesses, and with\nthe exception of homebuilders, not a single one of them feels the economy is at risk of falling off\nthe table. Big builders and engineering firms report a booming domestic infrastructure business,\nespecially in the petrochemical sector from the Gulf Coast up through the lower Midwest. The\ntech folks continue to find demand brisk—as manifest in earnings reports of Microsoft, Apple\nand others.\nOne of the biggest providers of computer services to businesses reports that, with the exception\nof financial institutions, sales have begun to flow again after being laid low by the uncertainty of\nAugust. The airlines report recent volume has been “less bad” than it was in the third quarter.\nShippers and railroads are concerned about consumer holiday demand and note slowing transPacific shipments into the U.S. Yet, they report that the tech product side of what they move\nlooks good, so the net impact, while nowhere near robust, is that conditions have not materially\nworsened. Outside of housing and payments due to some major law firms, we are not seeing a\nsignificant lagging of receivables. The mention of law firms may have caught your ear. They\nhave grown quite important to the U.S. economy. Nearly one million people work in legal\nservices in America, roughly the same number who work in manufacturing automobiles and auto\nparts.\nInflation\nAs they survey the economic landscape, many of my business interlocutors, however, worry\nabout prices. As do my staff and I. We have been experiencing a mitigation of inflationary forces\nand expectations recently, whether measured by such headline numbers as the Consumer Price\nIndex (CPI) or the index of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) or the so-called core\nindexes that exclude energy and food prices. And we have seen it in the trimmed mean\nmeasurement preferred by the Dallas Fed.\nYet, there appears to be some uncertainty about whether we will continue to see inflation\nslowing. Partly this stems from retailers who report cost increases on goods imported from China\nor from shippers who see continuous upward pressure on lease rates to move more expensive\nimports across the seas. We are also hearing it in other anecdotal reports, such as the rise,\nnationwide, of salaries paid to attorneys, architects and other highly skilled professionals.\n5\n\n\fOur concern about inflation at the Dallas Fed stems from two more pervasive sources—food and\nenergy, where we foresee a risk of a more pernicious pass-through effect than we saw in the\nrecent price increases of underlying commodities.\nIn food markets, we have seen a dramatic divergence this past year between food prices and the\ncore measures that indicate inflation in the 2 percent range. The CPI shows food up 5 percent\nthrough September. Green grocery prices are rising at a double-digit pace. The Producer Price\nIndex for finished consumer foods, or wholesale food prices, is up 4.3 percent year to date. This\npattern has historical precedent. A spread of the current magnitude between food price inflation\nand the core index occurred on several occasions between 1957 and 1980. But we have not seen\nit in a quarter century.\nAs Australians, you know better than anyone about the dramatic increase in milk prices, to say\nnothing of grains and other foodstuffs that go into feeding any creature that walks on two or four\nlegs. This is hardly encouraging, given that these price increases are occurring against a ramping\nup of the caloric and protein intake of a few billion new eaters in China, India and elsewhere. All\ntold, it injects a modicum of doubt about the wisdom of predicting further significant declines in\ninflationary pressures.\nEnergy price dynamics further cloud the picture. If you talk to any of the major and independent\noil companies, they will tell you they have no problem in finding oil or refining it or delivering\nfinal products. They will note, however, two key impulses that are at work:\nFirst, they see no evident slowing in the growth of demand for energy in the U.S. The energy\nappetite in the BRICs—the big, fast-growing nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China—is\nvoracious, and they are only part of the developing world. An enormous amount of chemical\nplant infrastructure and capacity is being constructed everywhere—from the U.S. Gulf Coast to\nthe Middle East to China and Singapore—to be nearer to either feedstocks or growing final\ndemand. Any analysis of the income elasticity of oil demand in low-income but rapidly growing\nnations like China and India points to even faster rises in energy consumption, with concomitant\nprice consequences.\nSecond, price pressures at the margin are compounded by noncommercial activity in the markets\nthat trade oil. Noncommercial contracts—the busywork of the “city refiners” in the financial\nexchanges in London and other places—have been running at triple their traditional volume\nlately.\nPrices for gasoline and distillates—where the pass-through rubber hits the consumer price road—\nare starting to inch up in response. Our retail gasoline price models at the Dallas Fed envision\npump prices above $3 a gallon for the foreseeable future if crude stays above $85. Price\npressures for other distillates are also becoming increasingly probable. And last, high inventories\ncontinue for natural gas, but it is noteworthy that prices have reversed their summer slide\ndownward to $5.50 per million BTU and are now quoted at $7.15 at the Henry Hub in Louisiana,\nthe key metric point for the U.S.\nAll this gives me a sense of discomfort on the headline inflation front, and it is a reminder that\nthe balance of risks is not skewed unilaterally toward slower growth. This is not to say I expect\ninflation to veer out of control. But rather, it means that we must remain far from smug on the\n6\n\n\finflation front and must conduct monetary policy bearing in mind that the battle against the\nnemesis of inflation is a perpetual effort.\nThis vigilance has always been second nature for the subgenus of the human species known as\ncentral bankers. Like the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal Reserve and the FOMC rely on\nan impressive array of instruments in determining monetary policy that contains inflation so as to\nenable sustainable economic growth. We are blessed with a rich complement of superb\neconomists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But in the end, no models or formulas\nsubstitute for judgment in making monetary policy.\nOur job has been made more complicated by globalization—the freer flow of goods, services,\nmoney, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the\nrevolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking\ndown barriers to international business and knitting the world’s economies closer together faster\nthan Skippy could outsmart a pack of hungry dingoes.\nConsider how this affects employment, which under our dual mandate the Fed is duty-bound to\nmaximize without upsetting price stability. Computers, the Internet and fiber optics have opened\nnew horizons for virtual immigration, which allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly\nanywhere in the world. We can now tap into the intelligence on the ground in Slovakia or\nMumbai as easily as you do in Sydney or Melbourne. Communications technology gives us the\ntools to get around—at least partly—the restraints imposed by physical location. It allows\nbusinesswomen and men to better manage their cost of goods and services sold, as well as their\ncost of capital, and to sell to a larger market, in their never-ending search to expand profit\nmargins. That is the good news. The not-so-good news is that demand-pull and cost-push\npressures abroad are transmitted more readily and ubiquitously to us at home.\nFor central bankers, this creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need to\nunderstand a technology-driven, seamless, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary\npolicy with the precision we would like. In our eclectic community, we have been debating how\nmonetary policy is affected by globalization, technological and communication innovations, and\nthe implications of the economic evolution into a services-driven, knowledge-based economy.\nHow do we as policymakers, attempting to influence the course of our respective economies,\nnavigate the economic seas when these new forces are acting like a magnet beside our traditional\ncompass, rendering us unsure as to how far off course we may be veering? Globalization is, in\nmy view, particularly vexing as we seek the true north of inflation control.\nIf we are guided by core inflation, we run certain risks. Core inflation refers to prices measured\nthrough statistical procedures that systematically strip out certain items from the basket of\nconsumer prices—in the U.S., usually food and energy. By ignoring items whose price\nmovements display significant short-run volatility, so the argument goes, statisticians and\npolicymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation. The goal is\nto strip out the noise so that we can focus on the underlying signal.\nIn principle, the concept of core inflation is sound. Because underlying price trends change only\ngradually, we will get a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow if we look at\nmeasures that help us assess current trends, rather than at the recent behavior of headline\ninflation that includes all items, including volatile ones that skew the results.\n7\n\n\fIn addition, the prices of most things are “sticky;” that is, they don’t change minute by minute or\nday by day depending on market conditions. Some models now in vogue suggest that central\nbanks should focus their attention on stabilizing an index of the stickier prices in the economy.\nFood and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should\nnot be the focus of our attention.\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding\nfood and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one\nthing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for\nexample, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Yet, a Big\nMac is excluded from the usual core measurements, even though consumers eat millions of them\nevery day. At the same time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants’ clothing,\nfor example, are at least as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in\nstandard “ex food and energy” versions of the CPI and PCE.\nA more discriminating approach might be to exclude the items with the most extreme price\nchanges in a given period, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything else.\nThis is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation that guide our thinking. At\nthe Dallas Fed, our measure excludes, or trims out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes\neach month for the PCE. A trimmed mean measure is also used by the Reserve Bank of\nAustralia.\nThe concept behind core inflation measures—seeking to eliminate noise and focus on signal—by\ndisregarding food and energy prices altogether may be a sound practice in a relatively closed\nworld with a predictable sense of the number of consumers and consumer patterns. This is what\nwe had for a couple of generations during the Cold War era, led by an ultra-dominant U.S.\neconomy; eliminating food and energy to silence a significant source of noise made sense in this\nstructure.\nHowever, a tectonic shift has occurred. Globalization, rapid acceleration of technological\ninnovation and a series of key geopolitical events have created an open economy infinitely more\ncomplex and decidedly more unpredictable. The world economy now incorporates China, India\nand the former captives of Soviet and Southeast Asian communism, and their caloric and BTU\nintake patterns are converging toward ours as they grow richer. Three billion people have entered\nthe world’s market, and they are ready to work, ready to innovate and ready to shop. As a result,\nwe are undergoing a sustained period of fundamental economic change that is forcing us to\nreexamine energy and food price movements through different lenses.\nWhen we pay more for food and energy, it may no longer represent mere noise but might be\nproviding signals of longer-term, structural inflationary pressures.\nIn these circumstances, a trimmed mean approach has merit. A trimmed mean approach will still\ntrim out volatile noisy numbers, which might include food or energy in any given measurement\nperiod. But it will retain, and thus allow us to focus on, the signals sent to help determine the true\ncourse of inflation.\n\n8\n\n\fNow, before you rush out from dinner saying that Richard Fisher weighed in against Mr. [Peter]\nCostello on behalf of the Reserve Bank, let me point out that trimmed means—while better than\nthe standard ex-food, ex-energy core measurements—are imperfect things. A few items that have\nimportant implications for our living standards—computers being the prime example—\nexperience large, technology-driven price declines month in and month out and hence get\ntrimmed out. The Dallas Fed tries to correct for this potential source of bias through our choice\nof trimming proportions, but we realize that correction is imperfect.\nAn additional drawback is that while the theoretical virtues of trimmed mean measures may\nappeal to central bank aficionados and econometricians, they may fail to resonate with the people\nwe serve. Humans—real people like my father and others who appreciate brawls, beer and\nbikinis—experience inflation and develop inflationary expectations based on what they see and\nexperience in the marketplace and read in the papers. To people who drive to work, air-condition\ntheir home and eat, ex-food, ex-energy measures or trimming this or that out of a price index is\nnonsense. Central bankers must be attentive to this sensitivity if they are to maintain the public’s\nconfidence.\nIn formulating and making my arguments at the FOMC table about the direction of inflation, I\ndraw on all three measures—the headline, the core and the trimmed mean number—in making\nmy recommendations on monetary policy. I also draw on an intrinsic admiration for the\ndynamism and constant inventiveness of a society that can transform the poor and the luckless,\nlike my own family, into middle-class prosperity, time and time again. And presently, viewing\nthe U.S. economy through the lens of globalization, I find that there is greater symmetry of risk\nbetween growth and inflation than is commonly surmised.\nI will stop here and, in time-honored central banking fashion, now do my best to avoid answering\nyour questions.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nOctober 12, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fJohn Taylor’s Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for kicking off what will be a productive and rewarding two-day\ndiscussion. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I want to offer each of you a hearty\nTexas welcome. We are grateful to all of you for coming to spend time with us, to share your\ninsights and wisdom, and to honor our esteemed colleague John Taylor.\nChairman Bernanke gave a very nice background on John’s work and the significance of his\nideas. There is little I can add, except to say that among those characteristics that all of us value\nso much about John are his decency and likeability. He is a good man, as well as a great scholar\nand policy aficionado. John, I am especially grateful you are chairing the advisory board of the\nDallas Fed’s newly launched Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, if only selfishly\nbecause it provides me and my colleagues with a vehicle for continuing to learn from, and work\nwith, you.\nJohn Taylor has divided his career between academia and government service, and both spheres\nowe him a debt of gratitude for having done so. It is, I think, appropriate that this conference\nhonoring John be hosted by a Federal Reserve Bank, because John’s interest in monetary policy\nhas been longstanding and has pervaded the research questions he has addressed. Fundamentally,\nJohn has demonstrated that it is possible to do serious economic research that takes monetary\npolicy’s role in the economy seriously. His efforts in this direction did much to restore a\ncommunity of interests between academic and Federal Reserve economists at a time when the\ntheoretical foundations underlying traditional monetary policy analysis were crumbling.\nEveryone here is familiar with how, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, John and a few\nothers embraced the notion that households and firms are forward-looking in their\ndecisionmaking and intelligent in forming their expectations, but rejected the view that wages\nand prices adjust instantaneously to their market-clearing levels. It is these nominal frictions that\ngive policy short-run leverage to influence the real economy. This approach to macroeconomics\nhas grown in popularity to the point that it has become dominant inside and outside the Federal\nReserve System. It has also stimulated interest in the nuts and bolts of how labor and product\nmarkets work. We have several papers in this conference that dig deep into these questions, and I\nam looking forward to hearing what the authors have to say about the implications of their\nresearch.\nCombine rational expectations with forward-looking, maximizing households and firms, and\nsuddenly the private sector’s behavior depends on the entire expected future path of policy. John\nwas a pioneer in thinking about monetary policy in this new, rich and complicated setting. This\nconference will explore some of the literature that John inspired. We will also convene a\ndistinguished panel later today that will help us understand how the new ways of thinking that\nJohn pioneered have influenced actual policy here and abroad.\nBefore we begin the discussions, I want to thank those of you who came great distances to join\nus today. Otmar Issing, Frank Smets and Volker Wieland all came over from Europe to be with\nus. Danke schön meine herren. Guillermo Ortiz came up from la Ciudad de México. Muchas\n1\n\n\fgracias muy amigo mío. Bienvenido. We have attendees from the Norges Bank, Banque de\nFrance, the Bank of Japan and the strong currency haven of the Bank of Canada, and, to prove\nthat good people are willing to travel long distances to honor John, from the Reserve Banks of\nboth Australia and New Zealand. Wherever you have come from, we appreciate your presence.\nI especially wish to thank the gentlemen who poured their blood, sweat and tears—and a bit of\nthe Dallas Fed’s treasure—into organizing this conference: Lawrence Christiano, Robert Leeson,\nAndrew Levin and our own Evan Koenig. They deserve a special pat on the back. And last, but\ncertainly not least, John, thank you for agreeing to this conference. We are honored to have the\nprivilege of honoring you.\nWe have an exciting couple of days ahead of us. Without further ado, let’s get started with the\npaper by Robert Leeson, Francesco Asso and George Kahn.\n\n2\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nCharlotte, N.C.\nOctober 4, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fInflation Measurement and Price Volatility\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you for such a warm introduction laced with good old Southern hospitality. It is a special\npleasure to address the Charlotte Economics Club. Harvey Rosenblum, the Dallas Fed’s director\nof research, spoke to this group about five years ago and still recalls the experience fondly. Like\nme, Harvey was hosted by Enrique Sanchez, who has been gracious and kind. Charlotte is clearly\na vibrant city, the headquarters now of nine Fortune 500 companies and two of the nation’s\nlargest banks. Between Dallas and Charlotte, I would say we about have it wrapped up.\nThe Fed has been getting a fair amount of attention in the last few months—almost as much as\nO.J.’s sports memorabilia collection and the New York Mets’ spectacular fall from grace. We\ncentral bankers are unaccustomed to being in the limelight—let’s face it, we are an unexciting\nlot. Not many people are proud to admit being devotees of the “dismal science.” You know the\nstory of the fellow who goes to his doctor in Dallas to get the report on his latest physical. The\ndoctor looks at him and says, “Look, pal. I am going to tell it to you straight. You are fatally ill. I\nsuggest that you marry an economist and move to East Texas.” “Jeez,” the crestfallen man says,\n“this is awful. I am astonished. Let me see if I get your drift. Are you telling me that if I marry an\neconomist and move to East Texas I will live longer?” “No,” says the doctor. “But it sure as heck\nwill feel that way.”\nWith all the hoopla over credit markets, British bank runs, commercial paper, moral hazard, the\nshriveling housing market and you-know-whose new memoir, I thought it would do us all some\ngood to step away from the hot topics of the day. I’d like instead to reflect upon the less-thanscintillating topic of inflation and price measurement. It is not the stuff of headlines, but it is\nimportant. If you indulge me this privilege, I would be happy to take questions on any and all\nsubjects during the Q&A period after my monologue and place my talent for obfuscation on full\ndisplay.\nBefore I begin, let me state up front that whenever I speak, it is only to express my personal\nviews. I am not speaking on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the\nFederal Reserve System.\nMost of you are no doubt familiar with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that broad inflation\nmeasure the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes, like clockwork, once a month. We\nusually refer to that number as “headline inflation” because of the press coverage it gets. The\nBLS’ monthly report includes another inflation measure, called “core inflation,” which excludes\nfood and energy. Once a month, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases headline and core\nversions of another closely watched price index—the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\ndeflator.\nIt is the core measures that I want to focus on today and, specifically, why food and energy items\nhave been deliberately and systematically ex-ed out when we look at price movements. It boils\ndown to what engineers call a “signal extraction” problem; struggling to eliminate “noise” in our\n1\n\n\fmonthly inflation measures and trying to maximize the amount of “signal.” The question is: Is\nthis still the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff?\nLet’s start with a little history: The term core inflation was coined in the early 1980s, but the\npractice of stripping certain components from the basket of consumer prices began much earlier.\nContrary to popular belief, it was food, not energy, that first got the “ex” axe. The BLS has\nproduced an “ex food” version of the CPI since the late 1950s, probably because food prices in\nthe 1950s were even more volatile than they are today. The practice of reporting a CPI excluding\nboth food and energy prices began when energy price volatility dramatically increased in the\n1970s.\nBy ignoring items whose price movements display significant short-run volatility, statisticians\nand policymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation.\nBecause the trends change only gradually, measures that give us a better sense of what they are\ntoday provide a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow. To make inflation\nforecasts over the next 12, 18 or 24 months, we are much better off looking at the recent\nbehavior of a core measure—whether ex food and energy or a trimmed mean, which I will define\nin a moment—than we are looking at the recent behavior of headline inflation.\nThat is the statistical argument. A theoretical argument offers somewhat more subtle reasoning\nfor using core measures. It goes something like this: Even in the age of the Internet, sellers of\ngoods and services cannot change prices every day. They have menus, they have price tags and\nthey have price-sensitive customers who live on budgets. Adjusting prices is a costly affair and\nnot something that most sellers would do with every change in market conditions.\nMy local Starbucks, for example, does not slash prices on days or for hours when foot traffic is\nunusually slow, nor does it raise prices when the place is packed and the line is out the door. It\ndoes not change them in response to day-to-day movements in its cost of materials. In fact, it was\njust nine weeks ago that Starbucks adjusted its beverage prices systemwide, about 10 months\nafter its last price adjustment. It is to this sort of pricing behavior that economists affix the\nelegant and intellectually snappy designation of “sticky.”\nWhen inflation picks up, firms that have delayed raising prices even as their costs have risen\neventually do increase their prices. When the sticky prices become unstuck, the hike will be\nsignificant. Of course, not all sticky-price firms will raise their prices in lockstep with each other.\nThe varied timing of the price increases creates a distortion in consumer spending. To correct for\nthese factors, some economists suggest that central banks should focus on stabilizing an index of\na basket of goods whose prices are especially sticky.\nFood and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should\nnot be the focus of our attention. To put it differently, theory suggests that a central bank should\npay more attention to the occasional increases in the price of a Starbucks latte than to the daily\nprice swings at the corner Exxon station.\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding\nfood and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one\nthing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for\nexample, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Our\n2\n\n\fStarbucks coffees are excluded from the usual core measurements, even though American\nconsumers drink many millions of them every day—including the one I had this morning. At the\nsame time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants’ clothing, for example, are at\nleast as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in standard “ex food and\nenergy” versions of the CPI and PCE.\nA more discriminating approach would be to exclude the items with the most extreme price\nchanges in a given period of time, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything\nelse. This is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation. The Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland produces such a measure for the CPI, and we at the Dallas Fed produce one\nfor the PCE. These measures exclude, or trim out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes\neach month.\nMany of the arguments for excluding food and energy—in particular, the statistical arguments—\nare based on the notion that an exceptionally large price increase today will be offset, somewhere\ndown the road, by an exceptionally large price decline. But suppose the increases in food and\nenergy prices we’ve been seeing over the past few years represent longer-lived trends, rather\nthan transitory blips. The arguments made for excluding food and energy prices would be on\nshaky ground. To put it more succinctly, we risk throwing out the signal along with the noise.\nCharlie Bean, the chief economist of the Bank of England who is on the Advisory Board of the\nDallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, posed an interesting question after\nnoting that globalization not only delivers freighters full of inexpensive electronics, toys and\napparel to consumers in the U.S. and Europe but also puts upward pressure on the prices of\nenergy and other commodities. What sense does it make, the real Mr. Bean asks, to exclude the\nfood and energy price increases from our inflation gauges while incorporating the price declines\non the other goods that we buy?\nCharlie was making a point in support of the Bank of England’s policy of looking only at\nheadline inflation and explicitly eschewing core measures in its official communications,\nprojections and analyses. The European Central Bank does this as well. Our northern neighbors\nat the Bank of Canada describe their goals in terms of a headline measure but give an explicit\nrole for a core measure—the CPI excluding the eight most volatile items—as an operational\nguide.\nI prefer to make this an argument in favor of trimmed means: As often as food and energy prices\nare excluded from the “upper tail” of our Dallas Fed measure, items like toys, electronics and\napparel are excluded from the “lower tail.” The trimmed mean meets both requirements of a\ngood inflation gauge. It filters the noise created by excessively volatile prices. At the same time,\nit hews to Dr. Bean’s observation that inflationary impulses can come from any part of the\neconomy, including food and energy.\nIn practice, monetary policymakers look at a wide range of inflation gauges. Most of the\nparticipants on the FOMC prefer the core PCE. In Dallas, we have an official preference for the\nTrimmed Mean PCE. We have been producing this measure for over two years now. It excludes\nthe items that consumers buy in a given month that have experienced the largest price increases\nor decreases, regardless of whether they are food or energy or any other consumable good or\nservice. The particular items that get excluded from the top and bottom of the distribution of\n3\n\n\fprice changes will vary from month to month, but the proportions excluded remain the same:\nabout 25 percent off the top and about 19 percent off the bottom, when items are weighted by\ntheir shares in spending. We end up with an inflation measure that does a better job of separating\nthe noise from the signal.\nIn August, the annualized Trimmed Mean PCE came in at 1.6 percent, the same as July. August\nsaw large price decreases for energy items—gasoline in particular—along with large price\nincreases in several food components. Outside of food and energy, some of the more significant\nnoisy items excluded were large price declines in jewelry and watches and men’s and boys’\napparel and large increases in the cost of dental care and bank services. Other items trimmed out\nin August included guns and ammunition, which fell in price significantly, and funeral expenses,\nwhich increased in price. I’ll let you decide for yourself if the two price swings were related, but\nI will tell you that we have had to trim both of those items before because their prices moved the\nsame way.\nLet’s compare that number—1.6 percent—to other inflation measures. The annualized headline\nPCE rate, which includes all prices, was –0.9 percent for August, with a sharp drop in energy\nprices contributing to the negative rate. Annualized core PCE, or PCE ex food and energy, came\nin at 1.1 percent.\nOver the past 12 months, the trimmed mean moved down slightly to 2.1 percent, while both core\nand headline PCE came in at 1.8 percent. If the monthly trimmed mean numbers continue their\ndownward drift of the past few months, the 12-month trimmed mean inflation rate could fall\nbelow 2 percent as well.\nThe argument about core-versus-headline measures in monetary policy is distinct from a more\ncommon and commonsensical complaint about excluding food and energy prices from inflation\ngauges. You saw it articulated in the latest edition of Newsweek.1 People, including economists\nliving in married bliss in East Texas, do not stop eating or air-conditioning their homes when\nfood and energy prices jump. Excluding them suggests a disregard for the impact on real people.\nI empathize and sympathize. Keep in mind, however, that the price indexes a central banker uses\nto frame, craft and evaluate monetary policy need not be the same as the ideal index used for\nmeasuring the cost of living. Indeed, there are macroeconomic models suggesting that if wages\nare stickier than prices, a central bank would do well to focus on an index of wages rather than\nprices. I just can’t imagine central bankers lasting very long in their jobs if they continually\nannounced to the public their desire to hold down wage growth.\nLet me turn now to the factors driving the recent behavior of food and energy prices—with a\nparticular eye to the question of whether those factors are likely to be transitory or persistent.\nMany factors impact the process of getting food and energy products to consumers, many of\nwhich are beyond anyone’s control. A growing season in one part of the country or the world\nthat is unusually wet or dry, hot or cold—like the drought Australia is having, for example—can\nlead to variations in crop production, leaving too much or too little to go around and large price\nchanges from season to season or year to year at the checkout counter. Large swings in prices\nwill follow. Shutting down just one major refinery—or several, as occurred along the Gulf Coast\ntwo years ago—can lead to declines in gasoline supplies and sharp rises in pump prices.\n4\n\n\fIn economist-speak, supply and demand for both food and energy are inelastic, so even small\nchanges in supply or small changes in demand translate into large changes in prices.\nThat is what economists have in mind when designing inflation measures that exclude food and\nenergy—a paradigm in which the shocks are primarily transitory and have large but fleeting\nimpacts on prices. But is that what’s going on now? We have just enjoyed a fine lunch, so let’s\nstart with food.\nOver the short run, the supply of food depends primarily on the weather, but the decisions of\nindividual farmers and ranchers also play a role in pricing. Farmers decide how much of their\nfields to plant in corn versus soybeans, and chicken producers, hog farmers and ranchers\ndetermine the size of their flocks or herds based on forecasts of the prices expected to prevail at\nharvest or market time. We usually think of demand as relatively fixed in the short run, but it is\nnot so stable that farmers and ranchers do not sometimes err in their predictions. When Mother\nNature runs amok or demand forecasts prove mistaken, or both, we end up with either gluts or\nshortages that require large price movements to clear markets.\nEven over several years, weather can still play a role in prices—witness the persistent drought\nconditions in the Upper Midwest or, as previously mentioned, Australia. But over the long haul,\nthe main drivers of food supply are technological advances and the agricultural sector investment\nthat fosters mechanization, higher yielding crop varieties and the like. On the demand side, longterm trends are primarily driven by growth in population and wealth. Changes in preferences can\nresult from recognition of the health benefits or detriments of certain types of food, but the\nlargest driver is surely growth in per capita income. Richer societies consume more calories, and\na greater share of those calories is accounted for by animal proteins.\nIn the Industrial Age and the present post-Industrial Knowledge Age, agricultural innovation and\ninvestment have enabled the supply of food to grow at a faster pace than demand, confounding\nthe gloomy forecasts of Parson Malthus. Look back in time and you’ll see food becoming less\nand less expensive relative to other goods and services, even as the number of mouths to feed\naround the globe has increased and consumption per capita has grown. The price of corn, for\nexample, may have increased noticeably over the past year, but it remains a bargain from a\nhistorical perspective: In 1860, the price of a bushel of corn was about 50 cents; translated into\ntoday’s dollars, that is about $12 a bushel. The current price is a bit over $3.\nIt is true that the long decline in relative food prices has been punctuated by occasional reversals\nas the pace of technological advance has fluctuated or as demographics have changed. I remain\noptimistic about the very long-run trend of declining food prices, but I do recognize that we may\nbe in the midst of one of those reversals as the world economy adjusts to recent changes in\ndemand. Biofuels production may be playing a part in today’s rising agricultural prices, but I\nbelieve this is minor in comparison to the evolving eating habits of billions of Chinese and\nIndians, the Vietnamese and former captives of the Soviet Union, Brazilians and Mexicans and\nothers who are becoming increasingly wealthy. This reversal may take several years to play out\nbefore technology and investment can respond with sufficient supplies to put food prices back on\ntheir long-run course. In the meantime, we are subject to “agri-flation” that may be more\nsustained than we would like.\n\n5\n\n\fOn the energy front, prices are shaped by demand and supply, just like most everything else we\nbuy and sell. Demand is determined by improvements in energy-use technology and the world\neconomy’s growth rate, including the breakneck pace set of late by the so-called BRIC countries\nof Brazil, Russia, India and China. Because energy consumption is not very responsive to prices\nin the short run and little excess capacity currently exists in the world’s energy-supply chains,\nsmall changes in the real or perceived balance between supply and demand can result in very\nsharp price swings.\nLong-term energy supply is determined by the development of fuel resources—both\nconventional and alternative. Short-run production disruptions, actual or potential, can greatly\naffect energy prices. Geopolitical events buffet energy markets every day, whether it is civil\nunrest in Nigeria, nationalization in Venezuela, fighting in the Middle East, disputes between the\nWest and Iran, or a strong-arming government in Moscow. Perceived changes in supply,\nincluding real or anticipated changes to OPEC production levels, can also add volatility to\nenergy prices.\nOil prices have been on a steady climb in recent years, tripling since early 2003 and breaching\n$80 per barrel last month. This worries many people who remember the energy crises of the\n1970s and the ensuing recessions. In fact, nine of the 10 post–World War II recessions were\npreceded by sharply rising oil prices. I will remind you, however, we have had several episodes\nof sharply rising oil prices in the past 15 years without recessions.\nRather than ignoring energy prices because they are dropped from core inflation, I am constantly\npicking apart energy prices to understand the cause of their recent climb. Here is what I see:\nFirst, it is useful to understand whether the run-up in prices is driven by increased demand or\nreduced supply. If it is reduced supply, like most of the oil price shocks prior to the mid-1990s,\nslowing economic activity and higher overall prices are likely. If the oil price increase is the\nresult of a demand shock arising from productivity gains, however, we could see expanding\neconomic activity and reduced inflationary pressures.\nRecently, the U.S. economy has responded to rising oil prices in a way inconsistent with a classic\nenergy supply shock. Despite rising oil prices over the past four years, gross domestic product\ncontinued to grow, unemployment continued to fall and overall price pressures remained\nrelatively moderate. Consumer spending and consumer confidence have remained strong\ncompared with the 1970s or early 1980s. Business investment activity has also stayed on an\nexpansionary course.\nEconomic growth in other countries has not been derailed, which has kept demand for our\nexports at healthy levels. A weakening dollar has not hurt other countries’ demand for our\nproducts, or their appetite for oil, which is priced in dollars. And inflation has been kept at bay in\nmost countries around the world, thanks in no small part to well-managed monetary policy here\nand overseas.\nAll of these positive signs are not what history teaches us to expect in a rising oil price\nenvironment. What gives? Economic research points to a number of factors—including a lower\nenergy-to-GDP ratio, more flexible labor markets, more experience with oil price shocks, better\nmonetary policy and less-rigid regulatory hurdles on energy-producing firms and such energy6\n\n\fusing industries as airlines and trucking. In addition, the development and maturity of futures\nmarkets and derivatives have reduced the need for physical inventories, while securities markets\nhave provided sources of investment capital.\nThese factors all seem quite reasonable, but I believe there is more to this story, and I am\nconvinced that the economic resilience we have seen lately is the result of an entirely different\nphenomenon.\nFor a few years now, some economists have suggested that the U.S. economy ought to respond\ndifferently to rising oil prices if the increase is the result of stronger demand for oil needed to\nfuel an expanding U.S. economy rather than a result of diminished supplies. Indeed, several\nDallas Fed economists are carefully studying this issue from a global perspective as I speak.\nSo far, they have shown that higher oil prices caused by productivity gains have a much different\neffect on the economy than oil supply shocks. A productivity shock originating in the U.S. will\nboost our economic output, and the expansion will pull up the price of oil. If monetary policy\nholds the growth of nominal GDP constant, this will result in a reduction of inflationary\npressures. If China or India or some other country is expanding rapidly and it is the country’s oil\nconsumption that is increasing, driving up prices, that surge in productivity can yield spillovers\nfor the U.S. in the form of lower import prices and technological gains. As long as this continues,\nwe can expect to see an expansion of output and lower overall prices, even as the world price of\noil rises. A vicious cycle is, in a sense, almost transformed into a virtuous cycle.\nWith each uptick in energy prices, I ask whether it is supply or demand that is making prices rise.\nSupply disruptions are cause for concern, but growth in demand is not as worrisome. Most likely,\nenergy prices will continue to be volatile; it is the nature of the beast. The same goes for food\nprices.\nThose of us responsible for crafting U.S. monetary policy cannot afford to be distracted by the\nflux of short-term price changes that are destined to be unwound. Our eye should be focused on\nunderlying inflationary pressures, some of which may indeed be coming from food and energy\nmarkets. Routinely excluding food and oil price movements from our inflation gauges may have\nmade sense in the 1970s, the 1980s and even the 1990s—but not now, nor in the next few years.\nThe conceptual beauty of trimmed mean inflation measures lies in their ability to capture steady\nincreases in food and energy prices, which may be germane to the pursuit of price stability, while\nexcluding the temporary spikes and dips that do not presage changes in the underlying inflation\nrate.\nSpeaking of beauty, conceptual or otherwise, I need to wrap up and get home to my wife in East\nTexas. By the way, she is not an economist.\nMay you all lead long lives.\nThank you.\nNote\n1\n\n“There’s No Inflation (If You Ignore the Facts),” by Daniel Gross, Newsweek, Oct. 8, 2007.\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "In the Lap of the Gods\nRemarks at the Greater Dallas Chamber\nAnnual State of Technology Luncheon\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nOctober 2, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fIn the Lap of the Gods\nRichard W. Fisher\n\nThank you, Daniel [Frishberg]. The Greater Dallas Chamber was kind enough to invite me here\ntoday, and I thank them, too. I am going to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss how\ntechnology drives progress in the Knowledge Age. Technology is critically important to the\nFederal Reserve System. It helps us run the business of the central bank. And yet at the same\ntime, it complicates the business of making monetary policy for the United States.\nI wear three hats in the Federal Reserve. I am president and CEO of one of the 12 Banks that\noperate the Fed’s payments system business. I chair the Fed’s Information Technology Oversight\nCommittee. And I sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, which is responsible for crafting a\nmonetary policy designed to foster sustainable noninflationary economic growth. Its actions are\nwhat the press and financial analysts love to bill and coo about.\nWhen I’m wearing my monetary policy hat, I consider IT from one perspective; in my two other\nroles, I ponder IT from another angle. Let me explain.\nFrom the business end, I look at IT as an enabler: It facilitates managing the Federal Reserve\nSystem and the business of our Banks. Consider these aspects of our operations:\nTake a dollar bill out of your pocket. Printed in bold letters along the top of it are the words\n“Federal Reserve Note.” We do not actually print money—the Treasury does that—but we are\nresponsible for ensuring that the banking system and the economy have the currency they need to\nfunction properly. Each year, the Federal Reserve System processes approximately 37 billion of\nthese notes—bills with denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. We store them in\nmassive vaults at the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and use 132 machines to count and sort\ncurrency at a rate of 90,000 bills an hour, day in, day out.\nWe also process the checks you write. Last year, we processed 9.1 billion paper checks and 1.5\nbillion electronically imaged checks.\nAnd we moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to settle their accounts.\nThe Federal Reserve System, in short, runs one of the largest financial businesses in the nation,\nand most of our work is accomplished by moving zeroes and ones through electronic spectra.\nMost people think we are analytical wonks, collecting, categorizing and correlating massive\namounts of data for economic reporting and analysis—all of it needed to conduct monetary\npolicy. But we also run a large, sophisticated materials handling business, involving shipping and\nreceiving, sorting and inventorying. We use advanced scanning and other technological means to\nensure currency is genuine and fit for recirculation. We use technology to digitize check images,\ntransmit and store the images, and turn millions of images back into paper for presentation to the\npaying banks.\n1\n\n\fOur mainframe processing power totals nearly 9,000 MIPS, or millions of instructions per\nsecond, if we have any nongeeks in the audience. Across the system, we have about 4,500\nservers and 24,000 desktop computers in use. Our national networks support nearly 3,000 highbandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end points, both internal locations and external\ncustomers. To keep this technology functioning, we employ some 3,000 IT professionals.\nBy itself, the Dallas Fed—located a few blocks from here on Pearl Street—moved 6.5 billion\nbanknotes through our five-story-deep, robotically controlled vault last year. We are assuming\nresponsibility for processing every paper check written in the western United States, from here to\nCalifornia. And as agent for the Treasury, we just processed our 1 millionth conversion of\ngovernment-benefit payments from old-fashioned paper checks to direct deposit.\nThe Dallas Fed is a bank. We have $40 billion in assets. We make money off of those assets and\nthe fees we charge from lending money and performing services, and we use the proceeds to pay\ndown the federal deficit. Last year, after paying taxes and a healthy 6 percent dividend to our\nshareholders—the member banks in our district—we paid $1.3 billion into the U.S. Treasury.\nAs you can see, the Federal Reserve is a large, sophisticated business. Like any modern\ncompany, technology is at the core of our operations. And our cost structure: We spend a third of\nour budget on IT. It is money well spent. IT enables us to provide our services efficiently and\neffectively. It facilitates our management of the payments system for the American people. We\nare as eager as anybody else to exploit technology to reduce our costs and maximize our business\nreturns. As business operators, we are saddled to Moore’s curve as much as anybody in this\nroom.\nNow, let me remove the hats I wear as a business operator and consider IT from the perspective\nof making monetary policy in the Knowledge Age.\nWhen the 12 regional Bank presidents and the seven Fed governors sit down to determine\nmonetary policy as the Federal Open Market Committee, the great technological advances of our\nage significantly impact what we do. Why? Because innovations that create new markets, boost\nproductivity or cut costs play a significant role in stimulating economic growth. And they help\nkeep a lid on inflation. In a very palpable sense, advancements in technology aid the Fed in\naccomplishing its mission of underwriting sustainable noninflationary growth in the world’s\nmost powerful economy.\nThat is the good news.\nTechnological innovation, however, makes the work of central banking more difficult.\nInnovation foments economic change—think of electricity in the 19th and early 20th centuries,\nthe microchip and Internet in our times. Successive waves of technology destroy old markets and\ncreate new ones. They alter cost structures and upset established relationships between inputs\nand outputs. They change the way economies operate, making the past a less reliable guide to the\nfuture. In effect, technological innovation constantly challenges our economic models,\nrelentlessly trashing our operating manuals, much like Internet music downloads are pushing\ncompact discs into the dust bin that contains our cassettes and eight-track tapes and supposedly\n“long-playing” record albums.\n2\n\n\fThe 1990s illustrate how technology can shake central banking’s basic tenets. Advances in\ninformation technology achieved a critical mass early in the decade, setting off an unprecedented\nsurge in productivity. The economy began growing rapidly, pushing unemployment down below\n4 percent. At the time, the Fed’s econometric models flashed warnings about inflationary fires\nyet to come. The textbook response would have been higher interest rates, aimed at forestalling\ninflation. Instead, the Fed resisted the conventional wisdom, recognizing the world had changed\nand the U.S. economy’s speed limit had increased. Technology would allow faster growth\nwithout kindling inflation.\nIt is the very nature of technology to undermine the status quo. This is hardly an original\nobservation. In the period between the two World Wars, the iconic economist Joseph\nSchumpeter documented the effect of technological change on economic activity. Schumpeter\nwas a man who knew how to pack a lot of meaning into a few words. He used to tell his students\nat Harvard in the 1940s that he aspired to be the world’s greatest economist, the world’s greatest\nhorseman and the world’s greatest lover. “Two out of three isn’t bad,” he said in wistful\nsummary of his accomplishments. He did not do well with horses.1\nIn the realm of economic thought, Schumpeter is best remembered for coining the phrase\n“creative destruction,” a seemingly paradoxical construct that with succinct and sublime\nprecision describes how new ways of doing things continually replace the status quo, destroying\njobs, companies and even industries that were rendered antiquated by the newly created\ntechnologies and replacing them with new ones.\nLet me give you a sample of the power of Schumpeter’s insight. “The fundamental impulse that\nsets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion,” he wrote, “comes from the new consumers’\ngoods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of\nindustrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.” He went on to characterize innovation\nas a force that “incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly\ndestroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.”\nCapitalism, in other words, is a continuous process of change—out with the old and in with the\nnew. What drives the process? The profit motive. And competition. Schumpeter understood that\nthe most powerful kind of competition was not between rival carriage makers, each offering a\nbetter price. No, it is the competition from whole new forms of transportation technology that\nbring the consumer a whole new way of traveling that eclipses the old.\nSchumpeter put it this way: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by\nrailroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost\ncalculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of\ndoing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\nWith each new generation of technology that you and your companies bring to market, those of\nus who study and model the economy have to rejigger our assumptions because “hardly any\nways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\nThe history of economic progress has always been shaped by new technologies—by the\ninventions of platforms that spur economic growth and spread prosperity around the world. The\ninternal combustion engine made horse-drawn transport obsolete, but the new technology also\n3\n\n\fmoved people and goods faster and cheaper, saving time and money. The mushrooming numbers\nof cars, trucks and buses meant jobs for drivers, oilfield workers, road crews, mechanics and\nmillions of others. ATMs culled the ranks of bank tellers, just as robotics replaced human hands\non assembly lines and even in medical operating rooms. Eventually, the tellers and factory\nworkers who lost their jobs were shifted to other sectors and contributed to the production of new\ngoods and services that fulfilled human needs and wants.\nThis process keeps us on our toes. If you look at back at America’s 100 most valuable companies\nin 1900, you’ll see that all but a handful are no longer in business. The reason: new technology\nand the relentless economic change it unleashes. Take Baldwin Locomotive Works. It built some\nof the best railroad engines in the country—first steam, then diesel—making it one of the top\nU.S. companies for decades. But Baldwin Locomotive ceased operations in 1956. Times had\nchanged. Technology had advanced. Baldwin was passed by.\nLook at today’s most celebrated companies. Along with such perennials as Exxon-Mobil and\nGE, you’ll see thriving enterprises built on technologies that didn’t exist when many of you were\nborn—Google, Cisco, Amazon, eBay and Research in Motion. Of course, if they do not stay on\ntheir toes, they, too, will eventually follow Baldwin Locomotive into oblivion.\nToday, we central bankers are grappling with globalization—the freer flow of goods, services,\nmoney, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the\nrevolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking\ndown barriers to international business and knitting the world’s economies closer together faster\nthan the New York Mets can blow a pennant race.\nGlobalization proceeds at a pace dictated by technology. The world’s economies are rapidly\nintegrating today because communications technologies have made it cheaper and easier to\ndeliver information at great distances and extend supply chains to the far corners of the planet.\nThe Internet and e-mail and cell phones and satellite TV facilitate the exchange of the most\nvaluable resource mankind has ever discovered: knowledge.\nConsider how this affects employment, which the Fed is duty-bound to maximize without\nupsetting price stability. New technologies have opened new horizons for virtual immigration,\nwhich allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly anywhere in the world. We can now\ntap into the intelligence that is on the ground in Delhi or Dubai as easily as we do that which is in\nDetroit or Dallas. Communications technology gives us the tools to get around—at least partly—\nthe restraints imposed on physical immigration. Throughout its history, the U.S. economy has\nbenefited greatly from the brain gain, and we cannot continue as the world’s technological leader\nwithout continuing to import foreign know-how. We hear a lot of talk about offshoring and the\nharm it purportedly does, but we American business operators have come to recognize how an\ninterconnected world can be our lifeblood, nourishing our economy with a transfusion of\nknowledge transmitted through the ether of the Internet.\nSchumpeter wrote of the power of creative destruction in the context of the industrial era. Those\nessential lessons also apply, in spades, in our globalizing, knowledge-driven economy, when\ntechnological change has become a juggernaut and products’ life spans have shrunk. New ideas,\nnew products and new companies are arriving on the scene faster than ever, while new\ncompetitors are appearing on the horizon, continually upsetting the status quo. Moore’s Law—\n4\n\n\fwhich embodies the idea that change is recurrent and accelerating—is the fundamental reality of\ntoday’s world.\nThe keynote essay of the Dallas Fed’s 2006 Annual Report2 points out 10 ways globalizing the\nKnowledge Economy has been raising productivity’s level or its growth rate—or both.\nPoint No. 1, lower communications and transport costs make products cheaper for consumers\nand facilitate globalization.\nPoint No. 2, when economies become more integrated, competition is enhanced.\nAnd, Point No. 3, specialization is enabled.\nPoint No. 4, globalization gives companies new ways to ramp up their production functions.\nThey can now access cheaper labor, raw materials and other resources at any time and from\nanywhere on the globe.\nPoints No. 5 and 6, globalization gives producers larger markets, increasing the potential payoff\nfor innovation, business formation and risk taking. Large global markets allow companies to\nextend their economies of scale by producing to satisfy global, not just domestic, demand. This is\nparticularly powerful in the Knowledge Age, where such things as microchips, pharmaceuticals\nand entertainment face high initial development costs but low marginal costs to produce.\nIn the New York Times the other day, a senior vice president at India’s Infosys Technologies\nsuccinctly summarized Points 4, 5 and 6 by referring to the future of outsourcing as the ability to\n“…take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world.”3 He might easily\nhave added, “and then sell it in any part of the world.”\nPoint No. 7, capital markets expand in a globalized world, freeing money to seek the highest\nreturn available and fund development of new production capacity anywhere on the planet.\nPoint No. 8, it is easier for productive knowledge to spread across borders, fueled by migration,\nthe Internet, cell phones and trade.\nPoint No. 9, globalization erodes national or natural monopoly power, reducing the excess\nburdens imposed on consumers.\nAnd finally, Point No. 10, globalization increases the range—and potential rewards—of goods\nthat can be consumed by more than one person at a time. Just because I’m downloading the most\nrecent episode of The Office from iTunes does not mean someone in Singapore cannot download\nit at the same time. Which is something you cannot do with the same can of peas or the same\nsteel beam.\nWe have had decades to contemplate the globalization of goods markets—TVs, shoes, clothing,\nfurniture and more, much of it produced by low-wage labor in faraway lands. But the point of the\nessay in our annual report—copies of which we will have for you as you leave the room—is that\ntoday’s globalization means international competition has spread beyond manufactured goods.\nModern communications technology has brought the reality of globalization to broad realms of\n5\n\n\fthe economy that until recent decades had been largely isolated from it. The nexus of technology\nand globalization brings business opportunities for those of you with vision and entrepreneurial\ninstincts. For central bankers, it creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need\nto understand a technology-driven, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary policy\nwith the precision we would like.\nWe are not alone in feeling somewhat uneasy with the changes swirling about us. A large\nsegment of the public feels threatened by the technology that we in this room embrace, and they\nfear the globalization it fosters. There is nothing new in this. When he was governor of New\nYork, Martin Van Buren supposedly wrote a missive to President-elect Andrew Jackson in which\nhe said, “If canal boats are supplanted by ‘railroads,’ serious unemployment will result. Captains,\ncooks, drivers, hostlers, repairmen and lock tenders will be left without means of livelihood, not\nto mention the numerous farmers now employed in growing hay for horses. Boat builders would\nsuffer and tow-line, whip and harness makers would be left destitute. … As you may well know,\nMr. President, ‘railroad’ carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour … by\n‘engines’ which roar and snort their way throughout the countryside, setting fire to the crops,\nscaring the livestock, and frightening women and children. The Almighty certainly never\nintended that people should travel at such breakneck speeds.”\nNow, the Almighty has given us the means to move at the speed of light through cyberspace.\nToday, technology is again doing what it has always done—creating enormous angst among\nthose it displaces. And yet it is raising living standards and increasing economic efficiency in\nmost parts of the world.\nWe live in a time when it is fashionable to look at all glasses as half full. Chicken Little rules the\nroost of economic prognostication. The innovators in this room know differently. Heirs to Eli\nWhitney, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and the Wright brothers, American\nentrepreneurs are accustomed to operating in an economy that is the crucible of innovation. Jack\nKilby and Robert Noyce, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg and, of course, Bill Gates\nsprang from the American landscape, not from Germany or France or China or India or anyplace\nelse. Inventiveness is part of the American DNA, nurtured in an economic system that\nencourages innovation and rewards it handsomely. New products and new technologies find\nfertile soil here in Texas and throughout the United States, where they can be funded and brought\nto market, only to be challenged in due course by the next round of new products and new\ntechnologies.\nA free enterprise system recognizes that innovation cannot be predicted or controlled. No part of\nthe computer was invented with the computer in mind. The keyboard came from the typewriter,\ninvented in the 1860s by Christopher Latham Sholes. The first program was written for Joseph\nMarie Jacquard’s loom in 1801, a technology to avoid mistakes made by the weavers. Vacuum\ntubes and transistors were first associated with radio and then television. The microchip was\ninvented for handheld calculators, not for computers per se. And the electricity that powers it all\nstarted out as a better way to light up dark rooms. Mix them all together and—voila—you have a\ncomputer, the unintended consequence of a series of separate inventions.\nWhat put the computer together was the profit motive—the potential to get rich by exploiting all\nthe connections, all the angles, all the possible products consumers might buy. This is why\nAmerica is by far the most inventive nation in the world. We are not necessarily smarter, though\n6\n\n\fI would like to think we are. We do not have some intrinsic aptitude that others lack, though I\nwould like to think we are pretty darned clever. We are not always luckier, though we are very\nlucky people. What we do have that sets us apart is an economic system that provides rewards\nfor those who dare to turn their ideas into realities. We have what you might call incentive\naptitude. You give us an incentive, and we’ll find an aptitude!\nAmerican technology will continue to march forward, as it has for generations. Skeptics have\nalways been proved wrong. Charles Duell once ran the U.S. Patent Office. He would probably be\nforgotten by now if not for a few words he is purported to have uttered in 1899—after the\nintroduction of telephones, electric lights and automobiles … but before the next wave of\ninnovation that brought us airplanes, refrigeration, radios and my favorite great invention, the\npop-up toaster. In 1899, amid the great burst of innovation, one that rivaled what we see today,\nDuell infamously proclaimed: “Everything that can be invented has been invented.”\nIf Duell had been right, the job of econometricians and monetary policymakers would have been\nmade so much easier. They could have put everything on autopilot. And, as a nation, we would\nhave gone into decline, deprived of the fresh energy of new technology. I’ll return to my best\nbuddy—Schumpeter. He knew better. He wrote that “we cannot reason … about the future\npossibilities of technological advance … those [technologies] that are still in the lap of the gods\nmay be more or less productive than any that have thus far come within our range of observation.\n... There is no reason to expect slackening of the rate of output through exhaustion of\ntechnological possibilities.”\nWe know not what marvels still sit in the “lap of the gods.” But history tells us it is a fool’s game\nto expect a slackening of the rate of technological accomplishment. Some of you may even play\nstarring roles developing the future waves of technology. Your efforts and the fruits of your labor\nwill fuel the incessant revolution of our economic system, making the work of central bankers\nmore confusing and challenging. As sure as I am standing here, I know that your success will\nmake my job harder. I ask only one thing of you:\nKeep it up.\nNotes\n1\n\nA very readable biography of Joseph Schumpeter can be found in Prophet of Innovation by Thomas K.\nMcCraw, Harvard University Press, 2007.\n2\n“The Best of All Worlds: Globalizing the Knowledge Economy,” by W.

            "content": "You Earn What You Learn\nDelivered to the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce\nSeventh Annual Real Estate Symposium\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nSeptember 24, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fYou Earn What You Learn\nRichard W. Fisher\nI am delighted you have invited me back to this symposium, particularly in light of my rather\npointy-headed presentation last year on the nitty-gritty of how central bankers measure inflation.\nI want to avoid any possibility of injuries in a stampede for the exits, so I promise not to inflict a\nlot of mind-numbing economist jargon on you today. I am going to speak this morning on the\nimportance of having first-class institutions of higher learning in Dallas and in Texas.\nI am guessing, however, that you, being in the real estate business, probably know that last\nTuesday the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting and decided to cut the\nfederal funds rate by one-half of 1 percent, an event that seems to have given rise to almost—but\nnot quite—as much chatter as recent developments affecting the sports memorabilia collection of\nO.J. Simpson. I also suspect you are eager to hear about the current state of the housing and\nmoney markets and the health of the economy. I will indulge your interest briefly and then get on\nto a message about education that I would like you to listen to very carefully.\nWhat I say today, as always, represents my personal views and mine alone. I make no pretense—\nand never do—of speaking for my colleagues on the FOMC or of representing the views of any\nother senior Federal Reserve official.\nTo put last week’s FOMC decision in a broader context, it is important to understand that the Fed\noperates under a dual mandate. That dual mandate can be summarized in one sentence: We are\ncharged by Congress with conducting monetary policy in a way that enables sustainable,\nnoninflationary growth of the American economy and its employment base. It goes without\nsaying that we must use our franchise to ensure a smoothly operating financial system. Money is\nthe blood of the body of capitalism. It must be pure and free of the virus of inflation, and the\ncardiovascular system through which this lifeblood of the economy flows must be in good\nworking order.\nAs we sat down to the FOMC table on Tuesday, we were faced with a situation that, drawing on\nmy Naval Academy days, I would liken to a ship navigating a narrow passage between two\nshorelines.\nOn one shore, we have an otherwise healthy economy weakened to an unknown degree by a\ncorrection to excessive speculation in its housing sector and related financial instruments. On the\nprice front, the economy has been experiencing mitigation in inflationary tendencies, thanks, I\nbelieve, to prudent monetary policy—albeit against a background of an energetic global\neconomy that continues to create upward price pressures on all sorts of commodities, on\ntransportation costs and even on what was once assumed to be an endless supply of cheap\nimports from China.\nIf we had maintained the anti-inflationary course we had been following for more than 14\nmonths by holding the fed funds rate at 5.25 percent, I believe we would have risked\noversteering our course and potentially run afoul of the shoals of unacceptably slow economic\ngrowth. Those of you who know me are aware that I am a compulsive worrier about inflation—I\n1\n\n\fdo not know any central banker in the world worth his or her salt who is not—because I see\ninflation as the bête noire, or bugbear, of any successful economy. Recent trends in inflationary\nimpulses and expectations, however, appeared to me to provide some wiggle room to adjust our\ntiller and steer a more growth-oriented course.\nLooking to the other shoreline, we were confronting the rocky outcropping that economists call\nmoral hazard. From these rocks, one could hear the siren call of market operators and institutions\nthat had made imprudent decisions and now hoped the Fed would rescue them with easy money.\nOvercorrecting our course with too aggressive a shift in the fed funds tiller would have, I believe,\nundermined the discipline that market forces impose upon wayward financial institutions and\ninvestors. Moral hazard is a dangerous predicament for any central bank. Yet we had an\nunsettled money market riddled with angst—a money market that, in my view, was going into a\ndefensive crouch in which even the best and most careful depository institutions and market\noperators feared that the positions taken by their less prudent brethren may come up a cropper\nand seize up the entire financial system.\nThose were the conditions on the financial seas when we met last Tuesday. As with any\nnavigator of turbulent seas, the FOMC relies on an impressive array of instruments; we are\nblessed with a rich complement of superb economists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But\nin the end, no models or formulas substitute for judgment in making monetary policy. The course\nof monetary policy is a matter of discernment—akin to the decisions made by a ship captain who\nknows that steering through a turbulent sea requires drawing on more than just charts and\ncomputerized navigation equipment. Drawing upon its best judgment, the committee chose to\nnavigate the passage with a 50-basis-point reduction in base rates, following its Aug. 17 action to\nreduce the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate.\nWith any publicly visible decision made at an important juncture, second-guessers pop up\neverywhere. Market operators and countless others, among them somber as well as bombastic\ntelevision commentators—armchair navigators, if you will—have been eager to discuss the\ncourse we have chosen. This is the nature of a free market for commentary. Personally, I\nwelcome it, as it sharpens our wits.\nCentral banking is not and never should be a popularity contest. It is a serious duty undertaken\nby earnest public servants for the greatest good of the nation. Thus, FOMC members will\ncontinue taking in-depth soundings on the progress of the economy and the financial markets as\nwe evaluate the impact of the 50-basis-point course correction. Should further correction—either\nto port or to starboard—be needed to stay on the course toward sustainable, noninflationary\ngrowth over time, we will make it.\nEnough about navigation and last Tuesday’s FOMC meeting. I will happily take any questions\nabout policy during the question-and-answer period and, in classic Federal Reserve style, do my\nbest not to answer them.\nToday, I want to talk about a subject that is of the utmost importance to Dallas’ future—higher\neducation and why we need to focus on developing the academic and intellectual excellence\nneeded to make this the great city we all want it to be.\n\n2\n\n\fThe vital capital stock of our modern economy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms.\nIt is our brains. It is our ability to conjure new and better ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our\ncommitment to exceptional customer service. It is our designs for better buildings, faster\ncomputers and more successful space flights. It manifests itself in new financing products and\nmedical breakthroughs, in mathematical formulas and biochemical experimentation, in physics\nand engineering and design.\nEducation and knowledge are the driving forces of a U.S. economy. Remember that agriculture\nrepresents less than 2 percent of our national economy and manufacturing employs just 11\npercent of our workforce. Only 5 percent of our fellow Americans work in the mining and\nconstruction sectors.\nEighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that\nincludes some of the nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs—jobs very much like\nyours. In Texas, for example, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for doctors of internal\nmedicine, $44.81 for geological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35\nfor registered nurses.1\nJobs like these can be done only by workers with highly specialized skills, nurtured by our\neducational system and honed by years of experience. Physical strength and manual dexterity,\nworkers’ primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and manufacturing\neras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We prosper by the\nwork of our brow, not the labor of our muscle.\nLet me give you a stark example: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing\nindustry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent of the value to our gross\ndomestic product. The legal services sector employed nearly the same number but contributed\n1.5 percent of the value added to GDP. In other words, lawyers produce twice as much as\nautomobile workers. Granted, that may not come as much consolation when you open your\nattorney’s bill, but those are the facts. There is no more vivid demonstration of how services\nhave replaced manufacturing as the engine of our economic prosperity.\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that “there are three\nkinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t.” Yet even mathematically\nchallenged economists are united on this: In the service sector-driven Knowledge Age, education\npays huge dividends.\nIn today’s economy, you earn what you learn. Spending time and money learning—in gathering\nknowledge and skills—remains one of the best investments you can make. In 2006, an average\n25-year-old high school graduate made $6,100 a year more than someone the same age who\ndropped out. A high school graduate who went on to college but didn’t get a degree saw earnings\nrise by another $4,160. Earning an associate’s degree added another $3,100. A bachelor’s degree\nwas worth an additional $15,260. A law, dentistry or other professional degree added $32,300 to\nearnings. The total, the difference in earnings between a 25-year-old high school dropout and a\n25-year-old degreed professional, was almost $61,000 a year.\nJust as impressive is the way experience in the workplace compounds the benefits of higher\neducation. The $61,000 earnings gap between high school dropouts and professional degree\n3\n\n\fholders jumps to more than $100,000 by the time these 25-year-olds reach age 60—a 66 percent\nwidening.\nWe also see links between educational attainment and job stability, with the best educated among\nus enjoying the lowest unemployment rates.\nYou earn what you learn.\nOf course, intellectual capital, like its physical counterpart, can depreciate over time. Skills can\nfade or be replaced by new technologies and as our economy evolves. Think back just 30 years\nand you’ll remember that our labor pool included a profession called “typists.” My mother was\none of them. Thousands like her earned their livings at clattering keyboards, producing the\ndocuments needed in business and government, but their once-rare skills have become nearly\nuniversal among computer users worldwide. Or consider medicine. Who among you would feel\ncomfortable with a doctor who stopped learning after medical school and treated you with the\nprinciples and procedures of decades past? You expect doctors to be up on the latest research,\nnewest procedures and best medicines to treat you. In today’s knowledge-driven world, none of\nus can ever claim to know enough. We must embrace lifetime learning if we are to prosper.\nIn a modern economy, we can no more deny the link between brainpower and income than we\ncan deny that the Federal Reserve is subject to scrutiny. We see the link between education and\nearnings appear across countries, among individuals and among states. Little old Massachusetts,\nfor example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita, has lifted itself up to first\nin per capita income. California’s 11th-place ranking in education gets it 10th in per capita\nincome. And Texas? Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income, well\nbelow the national leaders.\nOur neighbor, Arkansas, ranks 49th in both education and income. Mississippi is 50th in income,\na few notches below West Virginia, which is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to\nArkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia in educational attainment and income than we are to\nMassachusetts. I’ve got nothing against the Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the Mountaineers, but that\nis not where I want Texas to be.\nWhat does this have to do with the Dallas metroplex? Well, let me paint a picture for you. The\nDallas–Fort Worth area is the country’s eighth-most-populous metropolitan region and its fifthmost economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population, surpassed only by\nCalifornia.\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of\nthem all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. Its flagship is UT\nAustin. The Texas A&M System has nine universities, with 103,000 students and a multicampus\nhealth science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State\nUniversity System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and\nthe Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas\nWoman’s are independent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending\nthe more than 40 public universities in our state.\n\n4\n\n\fBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities.\nThe pinnacle of the state’s educational system is the University of California, with 209,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities. The system includes some of the best universities in the\nworld—UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\nHow do our institutions of higher learning stack up against California and the rest of the nation?\nAccording to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego\nand UC Davis all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC Irvine and UC\nSanta Barbara were tied with UT—at 44th. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M fell two\nspots to 62nd, tied with Worcester Polytechnic in Massachusetts. Worcester Polytechnic. Ever\nheard of it? Southern Methodist University ranked 67th, Baylor University 75th and Texas\nChristian University 108th. Rice University came in 17th, right up there with Emory University\nand Johns Hopkins and above Berkeley and Notre Dame.\nImagine that! The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one fleet\nsix universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our top public university.\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American\nUniversities, regarded by most scholars as the imprimatur of the cream of the crop of research\nuniversities. The AAU is an exclusive group of the top 60 research universities in the United\nStates. Those 60 U.S. schools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars and are home to\n82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy\nof Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields.\nSince 1999, three-quarters of all Nobel Prizes were won by faculty members at those AAU\nuniversities. No doubt, everyone in this room would like to have many of our Texas universities\nincluded in this prestigious group.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa\nBarbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles\narea alone. New York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony\nBrook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. (You actually\nshould add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.)\nAnd within the 262,000 square miles of Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas\nA&M.\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state you and I love to brag and boast about, a\nstate of 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of\nAAU member universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Dallas,\nthe eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn’t have a single top-ranked academic\ninstitution. We do have UT Southwestern Medical Center, a top-tier medical school, of course.\nBut a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built\non advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\nWhen a university is a reputed fountainhead, the best and brightest minds flock to it and\nfoundations, philanthropists and other agencies feel confident that their donations will be put to\ngood use. I read a study published 10 years ago or so that found more than 4,000 companies had\nbeen started by alumni or faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Imagine how\n5\n\n\fmany more successful companies have been founded by MIT alumni in the decade since that\nstudy, a decade marked by the very sorts of high-tech innovations that many MIT grads are so\nwell trained to master. It is little wonder that MIT attracts the highest-caliber students and\nteachers and substantial research funding.\nIncidentally, Texas Instruments was one of those MIT companies, whose founders also founded\nthe predecessor to UT Dallas with the explicit aim of creating “the MIT of the Southwest.”\nCecil Green and Eugene McDermott and the other founders of UTD understood that the\neconomic value generated by a university is tremendous. Universities earn some money from\nlicensing out their patents, but the lion’s share of the economic boom comes from the people\nthey educate, the ideas they cultivate, the companies they start and the research they do that spills\nout into the economy. More often than not, it is the university’s local community that most\ndirectly benefits from these overflows.\nMalcolm Gillis, a former member of the Dallas Fed board of directors and the immediate past\npresident of Rice in Houston, shared with me an interesting fact about his university. A few years\nago, he noticed that about 15 percent of undergrads were from local Harris County high schools,\nwhile nearly 33 percent of alumni lived in the county. In other words, bright and motivated\npeople came to Houston because of the university and stayed for the job opportunities available\nto them upon graduation. Many of the jobs are in high-tech, knowledge-driven industries for\nwhich Rice and its alumni have laid the foundation.\nDallas does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or\nthe Association of American Universities. Our local university leaders—good men like Gerald\nTurner at SMU, David Daniel at UT Dallas, Kern Wildenthal at UT Southwestern, Victor\nBoschini at TCU and Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington—are fighting with\none hand tied behind their backs. They need commitments and resources from the state and local\ncommunity if they are to give this metropolitan area what California has in San Francisco and\nSilicon Valley, or in Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in\nManhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, or what Massachusetts has in Cambridge, and yes, even\nWorcester.\nHow can we expect Dallas and North Texas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which\neconomic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and\nbiology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established\nfountainhead of advanced knowledge?\nWhen you leave this symposium today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. You won’t\nsee factories with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see\nglass-and-steel buildings that warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human brains.\nBrains that do research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad other\nfields.\nTexas boomed with the discovery of vast petroleum deposits, first in the eastern part of the state,\nthen in the west. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n\n6\n\n\fTo be sure, we can fuel our local economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts\nand other states and countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred\nintellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\nWe live in a globalized economy. Goods, services, money, ideas and people move across\nborders. How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans and\nVietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who will grow by making stuff so much cheaper\nthan we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they continue up the value-added ladder into the\nservice sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the sciences?\nHere’s how: We move even faster up the value-added ladder. How do we do that? By using our\nbrains—what my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart jar between your ears.”\nJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once drove Texas’ economic development, an\neducated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of our city, our state, our\ngreat nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is not oil. It\nis not gas or the chemical industry. It is not even the Dallas Cowboys, even if they are America’s\nTeam. Our ability to compete and thrive in the future—our ability to navigate into a prosperous\nfuture—will be determined by our elementary and secondary schools, our community colleges,\nour medical, law and engineering schools and research centers, and by our public and private\nuniversities. Education should be the highest priority of our community. It should be the most\nimportant priority of anybody who cares about the future of Dallas.\nThe North Dallas Chamber of Commerce knows how to sell. The people in this audience can sell\nbetter than anybody on the planet—you do it for a living. So do yourselves a favor. Go out and\nsell the fact that we need a world-class university, be it public or private, right here, right now. If\nyou cannot use your considerable talent to do so, then woe is the future of our beloved city.\nNote\n1\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics estimates.\n\n7\n\n\f"

            "content": "Speech by Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO (2005–2015)\n\nLas economías de Estados Unidos, México y la\nfrontera\nComentarios en un almuerzo de la comunidad del Banco de la Reserva Federal de Dallas\nSeptember 10, 2007 Laredo, Texas\nEs un gran placer estar de regreso en Laredo. Es un lugar que conozco bien porque pasé\nmucho tiempo aquí entre 1993 y 1994, cuando me aparté del camino del \"bien\" para\npostularme, de manera infructuosa, al Senado de los Estados Unidos. Pero aunque\naventurarse en las frías y salobres aguas de la política puede ser una experiencia sombría,\nsiempre hay rayos luminosos de sol que llenan toda una vida de cálidos recuerdos. Laredo\nfue uno de los más brillantes rayos en mi corta carrera política.\nRecuerdo de manera muy especial los fines de semana en que se celebraba el cumpleaños\nde Washington. Me pareció formidable la elección que hicieron en su momento de Ann\nRichards como el Señor del Sur de Texas —un toque maestro que ilustra la manera en la que\nLaredo combina, en audaz tono de broma, el respeto a la tradición con un sentido avanzado\nde la modernidad. Y me encantaba el esplendor y la pompa del Baile Colonial, lleno de bellas\nmujeres en magnificentes e increíblemente costosos vestidos.\nNo soy el primero, y ciertamente no seré el último, en quedar abrumado por la generosidad\ny el gran corazón de la gente de esta dinámica ciudad fronteriza, incluyendo nuestro\nflamante director de Laredo, Memo Treviño. Veo muchas caras familiares aquí, como\nRosanne Palacios y Alberto y Lucy Cárdenas, entre muchos otros. Alberto y Lucy son los\npadres de Beto. Beto me llevó a todos lados y viajó conmigo durante mi campaña al senado\nen contra de Kay Bailey Hutchison. Eso fue hace 13 anos. Hoy, Beto trabaja para la Senadora\nHutchison; prueba de que el tiempo todo lo cura.\nHabiendo justamente mencionado el Baile Colonial, me es imposible no mencionar a los\nLaMantias. Steve y Linda tienen cinco niñas preciosas. No fue coincidencia que después del\nnacimiento de Molly, la quinta niña, el padre de Steve, Joe, le regalara a la familia un perro\ncon el nombre de Boy. Es probable que, para sus adentros, Papá Joe estuviera haciendo\ncuentas del costo futuro de cinco vestidos para el Baile Colonial. Y con la misma certeza de\nmi sentimiento de amistad por la familia LaMantia, él supo que para mí quizás hubiera sido\ndemasiado abogar por una política monetaria menos estricta con el fin de facilitar la\nvestimenta de las cinco niñas LaMantia.\nQuiero comenzar hoy haciendo algunas observaciones sobre la economía de los Estados\nUnidos antes de abordar el tema de México y nuestra economía fronteriza. Les recuerdo\nque, como siempre, hablo exclusivamente en nombre propio, y no por el Comité Federal de\n\n\fOperaciones de Mercado Abierto de los Estados Unidos (FOMC por sus siglas en inglés), ni\npor el Sistema de la Reserva Federal.\nEl Predicamento Actual de la Economía de los Estados Unidos\nEn las últimas semanas hemos oído mucho sobre la turbulencia en los mercados financieros.\nY hemos estado distraídos por el ruido de la caída en los préstamos de alto riesgo\n(subprime), los constantes reportes de reevaluación en los mercados de títulos respaldados\npor activos, la volatilidad en la bolsa de valores y los temores de contagio a otros sectores de\nla infraestructura financiera. (Aparentemente no continua siendo cierto que, como alguna\nvez Andrew Mellon diría, \"Los caballeros los prefieren bonds\"). Entre el clamor y el drama,\nalgunos pueden haber perdido de vista la gran capacidad de recuperación de nuestra\neconomía. En el primer trimestre del 2007, el PIB de los Estados Unidos creció a pesar de\nmarcados descensos en el mercado de la vivienda y en la producción de automóviles.\nDurante el segundo trimestre el crecimiento repuntó a una tasa del 4 por ciento anual, algo\nque es considerable para una economía de 13 billones de dólares. En el segundo trimestre\nnada más, nuestro país incremento su producción en 130 mil millones de dólares. Mucha de\nla renovada fortaleza provino de las exportaciones, un recordatorio de que nuestra\neconomía flexible y altamente diversificada tiene múltiples fuentes de crecimiento. Con un\nsegundo trimestre sólido y un bajo nivel de desempleo, la economía de los Estados Unidos\nentró a la segunda mitad del año con buenos prospectos. En relación a la revuelta financiera\niniciada el mes pasado, podría decirse que soy optimista por la forma en que la economía ha\nrespondido: La baja en los niveles de crédito no parece haber tenido un impacto mayor en\nlos niveles de actividad económica fuera de los bienes raíces.\n\nEn la medida en que nos acercamos a la próxima sesión del FOMC, cada uno de los\nparticipantes, incluyéndome, está profundizando en las cifras y recibiendo retroalimentación\nde líderes empresariales, la banca, y otros que dan testimonio de lo que está ocurriendo en\nla economía en tiempo real y, esto es importante, nos comunican sus impresione a cerca de\nla dinámica de crecimiento e inflación. Yo soy particularmente activo en este frente. Antes de\ncada reunión, platico con cerca de 30 directores ejecutivos y financieros de una selección\ncuidadosa de empresas grandes y pequeñas del país, con el fin de tener un entendimiento de\nfondo sobre ritmo del crecimiento económico y las presiones inflacionarias que ellos viven\ndía a día en sus empresas. Al mismo tiempo, nuestro equipo de investigación económica\nsondea rutinariamente a una amplia base de empresas dentro de nuestro distrito y reporta\nlos resultados en lo que se denomina el \"Beige Book\", cuya edición mas reciente fue\nprecisamente publicada este miércoles. En últimas fechas he puesto especial énfasis en la\nmanera en la que los recientes sucesos en los mercados financieros están impactando sus\ningresos y costos, la dinámica entre proveedores y clientes, la composición de la producción\ny las proyecciones de crecimiento. Con sólo un avance parcial en estas conversaciones para\nla reunión del 18 de septiembre, y aún no he llegado a ninguna conclusión. Sin embargo, es\njusto decir que me siento bien por lo que he escuchado hasta el momento, que dista mucho\nde la constante especulación negativa y las notas de desacuerdos ocasionales tales como las\ncifras de empleo de la semana pasada. Nuestra economía parece estar sorteando la\n\n\ftormenta. El rumbo futuro de dicha tormenta y el curso apropiado de la política monetaria,\nsin embargo, están aun por verse.\nEn un reciente retiro anual para banqueros centrales y economistas en Jackson Hole, Ned\nGramlich, antiguo gobernador de la Reserva Federal, hombre muy reverenciado y de gran\nconocimiento en la materia que lamentablemente sucumbió a una leucemia imbatible este\nmiércoles, nos recordaba en un discurso escrito por él que el progreso de América ha estado\nsalpicado de periodos de auge y caída. El siglo XIX vivió periodos de auge derivados del canal,\nel ferrocarril y los minerales. En el siglo XX hubo auge en términos de innovación financiera y\ntecnológica. Pero cada periodo de prosperidad dio lugar a recesiones o caídas posteriores,\ncuando los precios no pudieron mantenerse. \"Cuando el polvo se asienta\", escribió Gramlich,\n\"hay una masacre financiera, muchos inversionistas aprendiendo a ser más cuidadosos la\npróxima vez, pero también están ahí los frutos de la bonanza para beneficiar la\nproductividad. Los canales y los ferrocarriles todavía están ahí, y funcionan; los minerales se\nhan descubierto y están en uso; las innovaciones financieras quedan, y todavía tenemos la\nInternet y todas sus posibilidades.\" Los frutos de la bonanza del mercado subprime, nos\nrecordaba, son los millones de deudores de bajos ingresos y de las minorías que ahora viven\nen un hogar propio, y que están pagando sus préstamos y consolidando un capital para el\nfuturo.\nProcuren tener esto en cuenta mientras el mercado de la vivienda vuelve a la normalidad,\nmientras los nuevos instrumentos financieros creados por la bonanza de vivienda y la\ntecnología financiera turbo cargada continúan buscando niveles de precios más racionales —\nniveles que serán determinados no por modelos de valoración artificiales ni por frenesíes\ninsostenibles de retornos, sino por la disciplina del mercado para equilibrar la oferta y la\ndemanda. Un gran numero de familias para quienes de otra manera habría sido imposible,\npudieron cosechar el mas preciado fruto del sueno americano —una casa de su propiedad—\ny todo gracias al \"housing boom\".\nPero, que hay de la recesión o caída que sigue a todo periodo de auge? A esa parte de la\necuación Gramlich la denomina \"carnicería financiera.\" Durante 10 anos manejé un fondo de\ncobertura de riesgo (hedge fund) antes de vender mi parte en 1997 y abandonar una carrera\nque había iniciado en 1975. Sé, por experiencia, que los mercados son maníaco-depresivos,\ncambian de humor muy fácilmente. Se disparan exageradamente en periodos de\nentusiasmo, y se hunden de más cuando las aguas comienzan a retomar su curso real. Pero\ninevitablemente hay correcciones. Cuando estas ocurren, siempre hay gritos de angustia —y\nmuchas sugerencias de cómo conducir la política monetaria— de parte de operadores\nfinancieros que sobre explotaron el tiempo de auge, dejando que la avaricia suprimiera su\njuicio. La recompensa se mide con el riesgo, y el riesgo es un arma de dos filos. Considero\nque el trabajo de la Reserva Federal no es proteger contra el fracaso a determinados\nindividuos que tomaron riesgos a la ligera, sin tomar las debidas precauciones. Nuestra labor\nes proteger al sistema financiero mismo. Mis colegas y yo asumimos esa responsabilidad\nmuy seriamente.\n\n\fLa gente siempre pregunta qué me guía cuando asisto a una reunión del Comité federal de\noperaciones de mercado abierto. El FOMC es un foro cerrado en el que se delibera a cerca\nde las condiciones económicas y a final de cuentas, la política monetaria es un asunto de\njuicio. Es un asunto muy serio y complejo. Para llenar las expectativas que se tiene de\nnuestro desempeño, tenemos que tomar decisiones y emitir juicios bien razonados, y no\nreaccionar solamente al último dato o el ubicuo \"análisis instantáneo\" del Internet, los\nperiódicos o noticieros, que extraen comentarios como agua de un hidrante. \"Análisis\ninstantáneo\" una contradicción en si mismo, y es raramente fuente de deliberación seria.\nLo que me guía es simple. Uno de mis cuatro hijos se encuentra aquí el día de hoy, mi hijo\nMiles. Siempre que voy a una reunión del FOMC, tengo presente que la trascripción de la\ntotalidad de nuestras deliberaciones será del dominio público en cinco años. Pienso acerca\nde lo que Miles, su hermano y sus hermanas pensarán cuando lean las palabras de su padre\nen un contexto histórico, alejadas de lo que la prensa y los mercados puedan haber estado\nclamando al momento de la reunión. Me guía, primero y ante todo, un deseo de que mis\nhijos se sientan orgullosos de su padre; un deseo de que tanto ellos, como los historiadores\nde la economía, me juzguen por haber sido un hombre prudente, pero firme a la vez. Hago a\nun lado las pasiones del momento y la sabiduría convencional de los mercados, y me\nmantengo centrado en la misión del Fed: Conducir una política monetaria tal, que logre un\ncrecimiento no inflacionario a largo plazo para esta gran máquina capitalista que son los\nEstados Unidos de América. Manejar la política monetaria no es un concurso de popularidad.\nTodo esto es una forma extendida de decir que, en mi humilde opinión, las herramientas\nestándar de la política monetaria no parecen ser, por sí solas, la respuesta a la actual\nsituación generada por la caída del mercado subprime. La mejor estrategia, como Ned\nGramlich recordó a quienes estuvimos en Jackson Hole la semana pasada, no es estrangular\nla innovación financiera, sino cosechar sus beneficios al tiempo que se minimizan las\namenazas futuras a la economía. Según Gramlich, más de la mitad de los préstamos\nhipotecarios subprime de los últimos años fueron hechos por prestamistas independientes\nque no estaban sujetos a la supervisión federal. En contraste, prácticamente todos los\npréstamos del mercado prime son hechos por bancos, instituciones de ahorro y crédito, o\nsus afiliados, supervisados federalmente. \"En el mercado prime, donde necesitamos menos\nsupervisión, tenemos abundancia de ella\" escribió, mientras \"en el mercado subprime,\ndonde más se necesita, la mayoría de préstamos se hacen con muy poca supervisión\".\nMi apreciación es que una gran parte del desajuste potencial como consecuencia de\nreacciones correctivas al auge subprime, podría ser resuelto, más que por acciones de\npolítica monetaria, por iniciativas en materia de regulación. Es importante, sin embargo,\nrecordar que las reformas en materia de regulación con como una vacuna —mejor prevenir\nque curar. Gran parte de la cura de esta enfermedad la proveen los mismos mercados\nfinancieros, y sospecho que estos serán implacables en su tratamiento a aquellos que\nincurrieron en un desmesurado riesgo financiero. Hay poco que la regulación pueda o deba\nhacer para detener que el tratamiento siga su curso.\n\n\fCualquier regulación estructurada para prevenir futuras recurrencias debe ser bien pensada\npor dos razones fundamentales. Primero, las instituciones financieras se adaptarían\nrápidamente y buscarían bloquear una reforma mal estructurada, mutando en nuevo virus\nresistente al tratamiento. Segundo, las regulaciones demasiado estrictas son, a veces, peor\nque la enfermedad que tratan de curar. Yo tomaría mis precauciones en cuanto a adoptar\nciertas iniciativas regulatorias que pudieran interferir con la disciplina en los mercados o de\nciertos intentos de proteger a determinados agentes económicos dispuestos a asumir\nriesgos, de las consecuencias de malas decisiones, por miedo a crear un daño moral que\npodría poner en peligro la salud de nuestro sistema financiero en aras de una cura\nmomentánea.\nDicho esto, quiero cambiar el enfoque de mis comentarios de hoy, y centrarme en la relación\neconómica entre los Estados Unidos y México.\nLa Economía Mexicana\nAquí, en la frontera entre Texas y México, uno se acostumbra a fijarse tanto en México como\nen los Estados Unidos. Yo también lo hago, en gran parte debido a mi historia personal. Este\npaís dio refugio a mis padres inmigrantes entre 1939 y 1947, mientras esperaban convertirse\nen ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos. Dos anos después de mi nacimiento en Los Ángeles,\nfuimos a vivir a la ciudad de México. Ahí cursé la escuela primaria y comencé a desarrollar un\namor especial por todo lo mexicano. Haciendo a un lado el apego sentimental de mi niñez,\nmi perspectiva económica sobre México se formó en parte por los cuatro años que serví\ncomo representante comercial delegado de los Estados Unidos en la administración Clinton,\nnegociando con México la implementación del Tratado de Libre Comercio (NAFTA, por sus\nsiglas en inglés). Aunque, la coordinación oficial de temas de infraestructura, regulaciones y\notras políticas necesarias para maximizar los beneficios del libre comercio se hacía entonces\nentre Washington y el gobierno en el Distrito Federal, nunca olvidé que las ciudades y los\npueblos a lo largo de la frontera, desde la desembocadura del Río Grande hasta las playas de\nSan Diego, eran, y siguen siendo, el punto de partida para la integración económica de\nMéxico y los Estados Unidos.\n\nEn términos económicos, me gusta decir que México y los Estados Unidos están unidos por\nla cadera. Tres quintas partes de las importaciones de México, la mayoría de las cuales son\nbienes manufacturados, provienen de los Estados Unidos, y dos tercios de toda la inversión\nextranjera directa en México vienen de inversionistas estadounidenses. Más del 90 por\nciento de las exportaciones de México están destinadas a los Estados Unidos. Los\ntrabajadores mexicanos proporcionan una parte significativa del músculo económico que\nhace tan poderosa la economía estadounidense, y México es una parte crucial de la base\nindustrial que alimenta las líneas de suministro de las empresas de Estados Unidos. Por\ntanto, es vitalmente importante para el Dallas Fed mantener un ojo avizor sobre los\nacontecimientos económicos de su vecino del sur.\n¿Qué estamos viendo al otro lado de la frontera?\nA pesar de que existe una demanda interna saludable, bien soportada por mejores\n\n\fcondiciones crediticias, es evidente que la economía mexicana experimenta un crecimiento\nmenos vigoroso este año, en gran parte debido a una desaceleración de la manufactura\nestadounidense y a un lánguido primer trimestre. Aunque el crecimiento del PIB de México\nmostró un repunte durante el segundo trimestre, y se espera que lo que queda de este año\ntraiga mayor crecimiento generalizado, la reducción del ritmo en la manufactura\nestadounidense, los efectos de la situación de los mercados crediticios u otros factores como\nmenor inversión extranjera directa y reducciones adicionales de las remesas, podrían afectar\nlos pronósticos más optimistas para la economía mexicana en lo que resta del 2007.\nLa situación en materia de precios podría también tener un impacto negativo en los\nprospectos económicos del país. En meses recientes, la inflación de precios al consumidor ha\npermanecido ligeramente por encima de la banda establecida por el Banco de México\ndebido a un alza generalizada de precios en bienes y alimentos. Analizada en contexto, sin\nembargo, la inflación mexicana ha alcanzado niveles históricamente bajos en años recientes,\nalgo que continúa beneficiando a trabajadores y consumidores. La inflación es un impuesto\noneroso y un desincentivo para trabajar, ahorrar e invertir. En una economía afectada por la\nplaga de un constante aumento de precios, un dólar ahorrado termina perdiendo valor con\nel tiempo. Lo mismo si se trata de pesos. Por fortuna, la economía mexicana continúa\nbeneficiándose del excelente liderazgo de Guillermo Ortiz en el Banco de México. Desde\nabril, el banco central se ha mantenido firme, anticipando una paulatina baja de las\ntendencias inflacionarias. Esto a pesar de que los precios observaron un importante\nincremento en julio, y las expectativas de inflación entre los agentes económicos y\nfinancieros podrían considerarse relativamente altas.\nLos obstáculos en el corto plazo no son, sin embargo, la principal preocupación de México. Es\nmucho más preocupante el hecho de que el crecimiento a largo plazo siga obstaculizado por\nimpedimentos estructurales persistentes. En su papel de entidad independiente, garantizado\npor la constitución, el Banco de México ha jugado un rol fundamental al atenuar los impulsos\ninflacionarios y las devaluaciones, liberando con esto al gobierno del presidente Calderón y al\nCongreso mexicano para que finalmente traten estos asuntos apremiantes.\nLa inversión en educación está comenzando a rendir frutos, pero la instrucción todavía es\ninadecuada en muchas partes del país. Los derechos sobre la propiedad no están tan\nprotegidos como debieran, creando dificultades en términos de préstamos e inversiones. El\ncreciente sector informal, que emplea a más de 20 millones de personas —desde mano de\nobra no calificada hasta empresarios desalentados por las onerosas regulaciones e\nimpuestos del sector formal— crea un nivel de ineficiencia significativa. La tendencia\ngeneralizada a la evasión fiscal limita la capacidad de México de generar ingresos,\nrestringiendo, en consecuencia, la inversión en educación e infraestructura que tanto\nnecesita el país. En el sector energético, la producción y la distribución están todavía bajo el\ncontrol del gobierno y, dados los limitados recursos fiscales de México, la capacidad futura\nde producción de petróleo es motivo de preocupación.\n\n\fLos obstáculos que acabo de enumerar están bien documentados y las autoridades\nmexicanas los entienden bien. No es necesario que abunde en ellos. Lo que es importante,\nes enfatizar el progreso tremendo que ha hecho el país en las dos últimas décadas en varias\náreas clave. México acogió el libre comercio a mediados de los ochentas; en los noventas\nfortaleció sus raíces económicas con los vecinos de norte y puso sus asuntos fiscales y\nmonetarios en orden. Desde entonces, la transformación ha sido notable. México se ha\nconvertido en una economía abierta, con una resolución clara a la disciplina política y a la\nestabilidad macroeconómica. Los días en que la algarabía del año electoral ponía de rodillas\na la economía mexicana, han quedado felizmente en la historia.\nOtro desarrollo interesante está en los mercados financieros mexicanos. La tan duramente\nganada estabilidad macroeconómica ha traído un portentoso cambio al otrora reticente\nsector de servicios financieros, dando origen a una industria dinámica que, después de un\ncomienzo lento, ofrece ahora un menú completo de servicios bancarios y de inversión y una\ncapacidad crediticia en aumento. Recientemente hemos escuchado que bancos mexicanos y\nespañoles están incluso comprando bancos en Texas y en otros estados fronterizos de los\nEstados Unidos a fin de atender a la extensa y creciente demanda de cuentas denominadas\nen dólares y otros servicios especializados de parte de la población mexicana que vive en\nambos lados de la frontera.\nLa siguiente frontera para México es la puesta en marcha de reformas estructurales. No es\nun proceso fácil, de hecho el país se encuentra enfrascado en un debate en cuanto al alcance\ne implementación de dichas reformas. Pero por duro que sea el camino, es evidente la\nnecesidad de redoblar esfuerzos para implementar las reformas que se requieren.\nMéxico y Texas\nHace unos momentos utilicé la imagen de Estados Unidos y México unidos por la cadera. De\nser así, Texas es el hueso conector. La economía de la frontera es única. La combinación de\nmaquiladoras, agricultura, comercio transfronterizo y la fuerza laboral binacional de la\nregión, ha permitido que el Valle del Río Grande, Laredo y El Paso disfruten crecimiento\nfirme, aún durante desaceleraciones en otras partes de los Estados Unidos y México. Las\nciudades fronterizas de Texas tienen un pie en México y un pie en los Estados Unidos, y su\ncrecimiento está ligado a las condiciones económicas en ambos lados. Los estrechos lazos\ncon México han hecho posible que Brownsville, McAllen y Laredo se ubiquen entre las áreas\nde más rápido crecimiento del país desde 1990 en términos de población y empleos. Pero si\nbien es cierto que las tasas de desempleo de la frontera se encuentran hoy día en niveles\nhistóricamente bajos, una fuerza laboral numerosa, creciente, y con un bajo nivel educativo\nha contribuido a mantener los salarios en la frontera por debajo del promedio nacional. Con\ntodo, hay señales de mejoría. Desde el 2000, el crecimiento promedio de los salarios en la\nfrontera ha sobrepasado al de Texas y de los Estados Unidos. Y en 2006, la media de los\nsueldos por hora subió más rápido en el Valle del Río Grande que en el estado o en la nación.\n\nLa infraestructura maquiladora y la industria de transporte —ambas relacionadas con el\nintercambio comercial— han significado un motor de crecimiento económico en ambos\n\n\flados de la frontera. La industria manufacturera de exportación del lado mexicano se ha\nbeneficiado largamente de un flujo constante de trabajadores migratorios del sur de México,\ny de la disponibilidad de proveedores de componentes y materiales del lado estadounidense.\nMientras el énfasis es todavía industrial del lado mexicano, los Estados Unidos se enfocan\nmás en una economía de servicios; aquí en el sur de Texas, el comercio minorista y los\nservicios de salud son dos sectores altamente dinámicos que constituyen una fuente\nimportante de empleo. ¿Por qué? Más oportunidades de empleo, acompañadas por un peso\nfuerte han contribuido a mejorar el poder adquisitivo del consumidor mexicano. La\nproximidad con Monterrey, la segunda ciudad más rica de México, así como de otras muchas\nciudades que albergan algunas de las más prósperas maquiladoras a lo largo de la frontera,\ntambién ha fomentado un aumento de los viajes de compras a Texas. Esto no es noticia para\nninguno de los aquí presentes. Entre 1978 y 2001, los nacionales mexicanos fueron\nresponsables de aproximadamente el 53 por ciento de las ventas minoristas de Laredo.\nUna economía creciente a lo largo de la frontera ha sido responsable de la explosión de la\nindustria de servicios de salud local en los últimos 10 años. Igual que sucede con el comercio\nminorista y la banca, los nacionales mexicanos y la creciente población de jubilados\nestadounidenses en México están demandando servicios de salud. Los hospitales y las\nagencias de servicios de salud se están expandiendo a tasas aceleradas y, junto con el sector\neducación y el gobierno federal en materia de patrullaje de fronteras y aduanas, generando\nfuentes de empleo altamente remunerado a los residentes de la frontera.\nAunque casi todas las ciudades fronterizas de Texas tienen profundos lazos con México, sus\nvínculos pueden ser de índole diversa, y sus economías pueden responder de manera disímil\na las condiciones cambiantes en México. Nuestras investigaciones han encontrado que\ntípicamente, los descensos marcados en el valor del peso resultan en un detrimento\neconómico en Laredo, McAllen y Brownsville. Cada una de estas ciudades tiene sectores de\ncomercio minorista que dependen en gran medida de los compradores mexicanos de forma\ntal, que variaciones en el valor del peso pueden llegar a tener un gran impacto en sus\nrespectivas economías. La existencia de un peso fuerte y estable —en gran medida gracias a\nla reforma constitucional de 1994 que le dio al Banco de México la independencia que ha\naplicado tan hábilmente en los años recientes— es una pieza importante del rompecabezas\nque explica el crecimiento vigoroso en Laredo y en el Valle.\nEl panorama continúa siendo favorable para el crecimiento de la población y el empleo en la\nfrontera, tanto en Texas como en los estados al occidente nuestro. Sin embargo, el\nverdadero progreso requerirá de una mayor productividad y de mejores salarios. La más\nimportante fuente de crecimiento del ingreso y de la prosperidad tiene su origen en la\ncapacidad humana y en la educación, que debería ser la prioridad numero uno de esta\ncomunidad. Y debería ser también la más alta prioridad de este estado.\nEducación e Inmigración\nEn el mundo de hoy la educación es fundamental, y para lograr el sueño americano debemos\nmantenernos en un constante aprendizaje. A nuestro economista en jefe en el Dallas Fed,\n\n\fMike Cox, le gusta decir \"ganas lo que aprendes\". La economía de los Estados Unidos es hoy\nmuy distinta de la que les dio empleo a nuestros padres y abuelos en los campos y en las\nfábricas. La agricultura representa el 2 por ciento de nuestra economía nacional. La\nmanufactura emplea solamente el 11 por ciento de nuestra fuerza laboral. La construcción y\nla minería representan el 5 por ciento. Ochenta y dos por ciento de los trabajadores\nestadounidenses están empleados en servicios, un sector en expansión que incluye algunos\nde los empleos más prestigiosos y mejor remunerados en la nación.\nMi amigo Stanley Fischer, gobernador del Banco de Israel, alguna vez apuntó que \"hay tres\ntipos de economistas: aquellos que pueden contar, y aquellos que no pueden.\" De cualquier\nforma, todos los economistas coinciden en esto: la educación paga. Hay un vínculo positivo e\nirrefutable entre la educación y el ingreso. Los salarios son bajos en la frontera porque los\nniveles educativos son bajos. Vemos este vínculo a través de estados, países, entre\nindividuos y en el progreso de Estados Unidos a lo largo de la historia.\nEl gasto en educación es una inversión en nuestros hijos. Pero eso toma tiempo, y nosotros\nen Texas y en los Estados Unidos hemos aportado de otra forma a nuestro capital intelectual.\nImportamos trabajadores con altos niveles educativos de otros países, y hacemos lo que\npodemos para retener estudiantes extranjeros que vienen a estudiar aquí. Esto es bien\nsabido a lo largo de la frontera entre los Estados Unidos y México. A través de su historia, la\nregión se ha beneficiado del capital humano de los estados fronterizos del norte de México,\nque cuentan con algunas de las mejores universidades de México.\nPermítanme darles un ejemplo del principio \"ganas lo que aprendes\", surgido durante la\njunta directiva de nuestra oficina en San Antonio. Para hacerlo, voy a permitirme nombrar al\nDr. G. P. Singh aquí presente, un verdadero ejemplo de éxito americano que combina la\nformación académica con la visión empresarial. De niño en su India nativa, G.P. estudió\ndiligentemente, y logró ser aceptado en la Escuela de Ingeniería de Punjab. Como muchos\nextranjeros, continuó su educación en los Estados Unidos, y obtuvo un doctorado en la\nuniversidad de Drexel. Con el tiempo, el Dr. Singh vino a San Antonio y fundó su propio\nnegocio de ingeniería —Karta Technologies— una compañía que acaba de vender por la\nnada despreciable cantidad de 65 millones de dólares.\nEl Dr. Singh es un ejemplo perfecto de cómo las compañías creadas por inmigrantes están\nampliando el progreso tecnológico de la economía de los Estados Unidos. Según un estudio\nreciente llevado a cabo por investigadores en la universidad de Duke y en la universidad de\nCalifornia en Berkeley, en el 24 por ciento de todas las solicitudes de patentes presentadas\nen 2006, aparecían inmigrantes como inventores o inventores conjuntos, en comparación\ncon sólo el 7 por ciento en 1998. De todas las compañías de ciencia y tecnología establecidas\nen los Estados Unidos entre 1995 y 2005, el 25 por ciento tenía por lo menos un fundador\nnacido en el extranjero.\nAún más importante, G.P. es un caso de estudio de cómo convertir el aprendizaje en\nbeneficio económico. Debemos lograr las condiciones que hagan que un niño en Laredo —o\nen cualquier otra ciudad de Texas, los Estados Unidos, la Ciudad de México, Nuevo Laredo o\n\n\fdel Punjab en la lejana India— tenga éxito económico en esta tierra prometida llamada\nEstados Unidos. Con una fuerza laboral de buen nivel educativo, ninguna corrección de los\nmercados, ninguna interrupción del funcionamiento normal de los mercados financieros,\nningún pronóstico apócrifo del \"análisis instantáneo\" ni de los insípidos economistas podrá\nhacer que dejemos de ser la mas poderosa maquina económica del mundo.\nCon eso terminaré el sermón de hoy. Y ahora, manteniendo la tradición de la Reserva\nFederal, estaré encantado de no contestar ninguna pregunta que ustedes puedan tener.\nAndemos, pues. Gracias.\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard W.

            "content": "The U.S., Mexican and Border\nEconomies\nRemarks before a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Community Luncheon\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nLaredo, Texas\nSeptember 10, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe U.S., Mexican and Border Economies\nRichard W. Fisher\nIt is an enormous pleasure to be back in Laredo. I spent a great deal of time here in 1993 and\n1994, when I strayed from the path of righteousness and made a feeble run for the U.S. Senate.\nWading into the cold and brackish waters of politics can be a gloomy experience, but there are\nrays of bright sunshine that provide a lifetime of warm memories. One of the brightest rays in my\nmercifully brief political career was Laredo.\nI recall most fondly the Washington’s Birthday Celebration weekends. I loved it when the\npowers that be here selected Ann Richards as Mr. South Texas—a deft touch that showed Laredo\nmanages to combine respect for tradition with a cutting-edge sense of modernity, and do it with\nsass en broma. And I loved the splendor and pageantry of the Colonial Ball, with all those\nbeautiful young women in those magnificent and phenomenally expensive dresses.\nI am not the first and certainly won’t be the last to be overwhelmed by the generosity of the bighearted people of this dynamic border city, including that of our remarkable director from\nLaredo, Memo Trevino. I see many friendly faces here today, including Rosanne Palacios and\nAlberto and Lucy Cardenas, among so many others. Alberto and Lucy are the parents of Beto.\nBeto drove me around and traveled with me during my Senate campaign against Kay Bailey\nHutchison. That was 13 years ago. Today, Beto works for Senator Hutchison, proof that time\nreally does heal all wounds.\nHaving just mentioned the Colonial Ball, I can’t help but single out the LaMantias. Steve and\nLinda have five precious girls. It was not for nothing that after the birth of Molly, the fifth\ndaughter, Steve’s dad, Joe, gave the family a dog named Boy. In the back of his mind, Papa Joe\nwas likely discounting the future cost of five dresses for the Colonial Ball. And as true as my\nfriendship is for the LaMantia family, he knew it would have been a bit much for me to argue for\nloosening monetary policy in order to accommodate outfitting those five LaMantia girls.\nI want to start today with a few observations about the U.S. economy before turning to the\nsubject of Mexico and our border economy. I remind you that, as always, I speak only for myself\nand neither for the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—nor the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe Current Predicament of the U.S. Economy\nIn recent weeks, we have heard much about financial market turbulence. We’ve been distracted\nby the noise of the subprime fallout, periodic reports of a “seizing up” in asset-backed\ncommercial paper markets, volatility in the stock market and tremors in other parts of the\nfinancial infrastructure. (Apparently it is no longer true that, as Andrew Mellon once famously\nquipped, “Gentlemen prefer bonds.”) Amidst this clamor and drama, some might have lost sight\nof our economy’s great resiliency. In the first quarter of 2007, U.S. GDP rose despite sharp\ndeclines in housing and automobile production. Then second-quarter growth rebounded to a 4\npercent annual rate, which is considerable for a $13 trillion economy; in the second quarter\nalone, Americans produced $130 billion in incremental output. Much of the renewed strength\n1\n\n\fcame from net exports benefiting from a still-growing, historically dynamic global economy, a\nreminder that our flexible, highly diverse economy has many sources of growth. With a solid\nsecond quarter and low unemployment, the U.S. economy entered the second half of the year\nwith good forward momentum. Given the financial turmoil that began last month, I am generally\nencouraged by what I have heard and seen so far: As yet, tighter credit conditions do not appear\nto have had a major impact on overall economic activity outside of real estate.\nAs we approach the upcoming session of the FOMC, each of the participants, including me, is\ndiving deep into the data and taking soundings from business leaders, bankers and others with\noperating ears to the ground to ascertain the current pace of the economy and—this is\nimportant—the prospective dynamics of growth and inflation. I am particularly active on this\nfront. Before each meeting, I speak with around 30 CEOs and CFOs of a careful selection of\nlarge and small companies from around the country in order to get an in-depth understanding of\nthe pace of economic growth and price pressures they see through their businesses. Meanwhile,\nour staff routinely surveys a broad base of businesses within our district and reports their\nfindings in what is known as the Beige Book, the most recent of which was released last\nWednesday. Lately, I have focused on how recent developments in financial markets are\nimpacting the revenues and costs, supplier and customer dynamics, product mix and growth\nprojections of these hands-on operators of our economy. I am only partway along in studying the\nentrails of the Beige Book and a third of the way through my CEO and CFO conversations and\nhave not yet reached any conclusions. However, it is fair to say that I am encouraged by what I\nhave heard against a background of constant negative speculation and the occasional discordant\nnote, such as last week’s employment numbers. Our economy appears to be weathering the storm\nthus far. The future path of that storm and the appropriate policy course, however, are still to be\ndetermined.\nAt a recent Jackson Hole retreat for central bankers and economists, Ned Gramlich, a muchrevered and very wise former Fed governor who sadly succumbed to leukemia on Wednesday,\nreminded us in a speech that America’s economic progress has been punctuated with booms and\nbusts. The 19th century had its canal, railroad and mineral booms. The 20th century had its\nrushes of financial innovation and new technology. Each boom was followed by a collapse when\nprices could no longer keep up. “When the dust clears,” Gramlich wrote, “there is financial\ncarnage, many investors learning to be more careful next time, but there are often the fruits of the\nboom still around to benefit productivity…. The canals and railroads are still there and\nfunctional, the minerals are discovered and in use, the financing innovations stay and we still\nhave the Internet and all its capabilities.” The fruits of the subprime market boom, he reminded\nus, are the millions of low-income and minority borrowers who now own their own homes and\nare successfully making their payments and building equity for the future.\nKeep this in mind as the housing market corrects and the new financial instruments spawned by\nthe housing boom and turbocharged financial technology continue seeking more rational price\nlevels—levels that will be determined not by ersatz valuation models and unsustainable return\nassumptions, but by the market’s discipline in equilibrating supply and demand. A great many\nfamilies who would never have had access to the ultimate fruit of the American harvest—\nhomeownership—were able to achieve that dream because of the housing boom.\nAnd what about the “bust” side of the equation, what Gramlich referred to as the “financial\ncarnage”? I managed a hedge fund for 10 years before selling my interests in 1997, as I wound\n2\n\n\fup a banking and asset-management career that had started in 1975. I know from experience that\nmarkets are manic-depressive, subject to enormous mood swings. They overshoot on the upside\nin periods of enthusiasm and on the downside when reality sets in. During the inevitable\ncorrections, there are always cries of anguish—and no paucity of self-serving policy\nrecommendations—from financial market operators who exploited a boom and then let\ncomplacency or greed get the better of their judgment. Reward is commensurate with risk, and\nrisk is a double-edged sword. I do not believe the Federal Reserve’s job is to protect specific risk\ntakers who failed to protect themselves from potential downside wounds. The Federal Reserve’s\njob is to protect the system itself. My colleagues and I take that responsibility very seriously.\nPeople always ask what guides me when I sit at the Federal Open Market Committee table. The\nFOMC is a deliberative body, and monetary policy is a judgmental business in the end. It is a\ncomplex and serious business. To live up to what is expected of us, we have to make considered\njudgments and not react to the latest data point or the “instant analysis” that is ubiquitous on the\nInternet or in the news media or among the countless financial analysts who pump out\ncommentary like water from a fire hydrant. “Instant analysis” is a wonderful oxymoron—a true\ncontradiction in terms, like “jumbo shrimp” or “funny economist”—but hardly the stuff of\nserious deliberation.\nWhat guides me at the table is pretty straightforward. One of my four children is here today, my\nson Miles. Whenever I sit at the FOMC table, I am mindful that the entire transcript of our\ndeliberations will be released in five years. I think about what Miles and his brother and sisters\nwill think when they read their father’s words in a historical context, removed from whatever the\npress and the markets may be clamoring about at the time of the meeting. I am guided first and\nforemost by a desire for my children to be proud of their dad; to be judged by them as well as by\neconomic historians as having been wise rather than too smart by half, as having a steady hand\nrather than an itchy trigger finger. I set aside the passions of the moment and the conventional\nwisdom in the markets and keep a steady focus on the Fed’s mission: To conduct monetary\npolicy so as to achieve long-term, noninflationary economic growth for the great capitalist\nmachine that is the United States of America. Conducting monetary policy is not a popularity\ncontest.\nAll of this is a long way of saying that, in my humble opinion, the standard tools of monetary\npolicy are insufficient, by themselves, to deal with the subprime market fallout. The best course,\nas Ned Gramlich reminded us, is to minimize the future threat to the economy while taking care\nnot to strangle financial innovation and its benefits. He reckoned that over half the subprime\nmortgage loans in recent years were made by independent lenders who were not subject to\nfederal supervision. Virtually all prime market loans, by contrast, are made by federally\nsupervised banks and thrifts or their affiliates. Gramlich pointed out that “[i]n the prime market,\nwhere we need supervision less, we have lots of it,” whereas “in the subprime market, where we\nbadly need supervision, a majority of loans are made with very little supervision.”\nMy guess is that a great deal of the potential dislocation resulting from corrective reactions to the\nsubprime boom will be resolved by regulatory initiatives rather than by monetary policy. Yet it is\nimportant to remember that regulatory reforms are like a vaccine—better at preventing sickness\nthan at curing it. Much of the solution for the current pathology lies in the curative workings of\nthe financial markets. I suspect the markets will be unsparing in their treatment of the most\n3\n\n\fegregious of those who engaged in risky financial behavior. There is little that regulation can or\nshould do to interfere with letting that treatment run its course.\nAny new regulations that might now be crafted to prevent future recurrences must be well\nthought out, for two reasons. First, financial institutions will quickly adapt to defeat any\nregulation that is poorly designed, morphing into new, vaccine-resistant strains. Second, heavyhanded regulations are sometimes worse than the disease against which they are meant to\nprotect. I would be wary of any regulatory initiatives that interfere with market discipline and\nattempts to protect risk takers from the consequences of bad decisions for fear of creating a\nmoral hazard that might endanger the long-term health of our economic and financial system\nsimply to provide momentary relief.\nOn that happy note, I want to shift the focus of my remarks today and comment on the U.S.–\nMexico economic relationship.\nThe Mexican Economy\nHere on the Texas–Mexico border, you are used to paying as much attention to Mexico as the\nU.S. I do, too, in no small part because of my personal history. The country provided refuge to\nmy immigrant parents between 1939 and 1947 as they waited to become U.S. citizens. Two years\nafter I was born in Los Angeles, we were off to Mexico City, where I was educated through\nprimary school and developed a love for all things Mexican. Apart from my sentimental\nchildhood attachment, my economic perspective on Mexico was forged in part by the four years I\nspent as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration, negotiating with Mexico\non the implementation of NAFTA. Back then, the official coordination of infrastructure issues,\nregulations and other policies needed to maximize the gains from free trade was done between\nthe nations’ capitals. But I never forgot that the cities and towns along the border, from the\nmouth of the Rio Grande to San Diego’s beaches, were, and continue to be, ground zero for the\neconomic integration of Mexico and the U.S.\nI like to say that Mexico and the United States are joined at the hip, especially when it comes to\nthe two nations’ economies. Three-fifths of Mexico’s imports, most of which are manufactured\ngoods, are from the U.S., and two-thirds of all foreign direct investment into Mexico comes from\nU.S. investors. More than 90 percent of Mexico’s exports are destined for the United States.\nMexican workers provide a significant part of the economic muscle that makes the U.S. economy\nso mighty, and Mexico is a critical part of our industrial base, feeding the supply lines of\nAmerican businesses. It is, therefore, vitally important for the Dallas Fed to keep a watchful eye\non the economic goings-on of its southern neighbor.\nWhat are we seeing across the border? Let me speak directly to the members of the Mexican\npress that are here.\nDespite healthy internal consumer demand supported by much-improved credit conditions, we\nsee a Mexican economy experiencing slower growth this year, largely due to a slowdown in U.S.\nmanufacturing and a weak first quarter. Mexico’s second-quarter GDP growth picked up,\nhowever, and the rest of this year is expected to bring faster overall growth although a slowing in\nU.S. manufacturing, fallout from the credit markets situation or other factors such as less foreign\n4\n\n\fdirect investment and further weakness in remittances could upset the more optimistic forecasts\nfor the Mexican economy during the rest of 2007.\nRecent price developments could dampen prospects as well. Consumer price inflation has been\nslightly above Banco de México’s target range for a few months because of a run-up in\ncommodity and food prices. However, Mexican inflation has been at historic lows in recent\nyears, which continues to benefit workers and consumers. Inflation is an onerous tax and a\ndisincentive to work, save and invest. In an economy plagued by rising prices, a dollar saved\nends up a quarter earned, a fact that does not change if you deal in pesos and centavos.\nThankfully, the Mexican economy continues to benefit under the superb leadership of Guillermo\nOrtíz at Banco de México. The central bank has elected to stand pat since April, anticipating that\ninflation is on a slow downward trend. Nevertheless, prices spiked in July, and inflation\nexpectations among economic and financial agents may be a bit too high.\nShort-term obstacles, however, are not Mexico’s foremost concern. Much more worrisome is the\nfact that long-term growth remains hampered by persistent structural impediments. And yet the\nBanco de México, having used its constitutionally guaranteed independence to subdue distracting\ninflationary impulses and peso devaluations, has liberated President Calderón’s government and\nthe Mexican Congress to finally deal with these vexing issues.\nInvestments in education are beginning to pay off, but schooling is still inadequate in many parts\nof the country. Property rights aren’t enforced as well as they should be, creating difficulties for\nlending and investing. The sprawling informal sector that employs more than 20 million\npeople—from low-skilled workers to entrepreneurs discouraged by the formal sector’s\nburdensome regulations and taxes—creates significant inefficiency. Widespread tax evasion\nlimits Mexico’s ability to raise revenue, a hurdle for needed investment in education and\ninfrastructure. In the energy sector, production and distribution are under government control\nand, given Mexico’s limited fiscal resources, future oil-producing capacity is a cause for\nconcern.\nThe obstacles I’ve just enumerated in Spanish are well documented and well understood by\nMexican authorities. There is no need for me to dwell on them today. It is important to\nemphasize the tremendous progress the country has made over the past two decades in several\nkey areas. Mexico embraced free trade in the mid-1980s and strengthened its economic roots\nwith its northern neighbors and got its fiscal and monetary affairs in order in the 1990s. Since\nthen, the transformation has been remarkable. Mexico has become an open economy with a\nsteadfast dedication to policy discipline and macroeconomic stability. Gone are the days when\nelection-year turmoil invariably brought Mexico’s economy to its knees.\nAnother interesting development is in Mexican financial markets. Hard-earned macroeconomic\nstability has brought momentous change to Mexico’s once-backward financial services sector,\ngiving birth to a dynamic industry that, after a slow start, now offers a full menu of banking and\ninvestment services and increasing lending capacity. Mexican and Spanish banks are even\nbuying banks in Texas and other U.S. border states to tap the large and growing Mexican\npopulation living on both sides and cater to their demand for dollar-denominated accounts and\nother specialized services.\n\n5\n\n\fThe next frontier for Mexico is the implementation of structural reforms. There is much debate\nover just what the reforms should look like. Difficult as the process may be, Mexico must\nredouble its efforts to implement needed reforms.\nMexico and Texas\nA few moments ago, I used the image of the U.S. and Mexico being joined at the hip. If so, that\nmakes Texas the hipbone that connects them. The border economy is unique. The combination of\nmaquiladoras, agriculture, cross-border trade and the region’s binational labor pool has let the\nRio Grande Valley, Laredo and El Paso enjoy solid growth, even during slowdowns elsewhere in\nthe U.S. and Mexico. Texas’ border cities have one foot in Mexico and one foot in the U.S., with\ngrowth linked to economic conditions on both sides. The close ties to Mexico have allowed\nBrownsville, McAllen and Laredo to rank among the country’s fastest-growing areas since 1990\nin terms of population and jobs, and border unemployment rates have dropped to record lows. A\nlarge and rapidly growing labor force and low education levels, however, have meant that border\nwages have remained low relative to the national average. Still, there are signs of improvement.\nSince 2000, average wages on the border have outpaced state and U.S. wage growth. And in\n2006, median hourly wages increased faster in the Rio Grande Valley than in the state or the\nnation.\nMaquiladoras and trade-related transportation infrastructure have long been engines of economic\ngrowth along both sides of the border. Export-related manufacturers on the Mexican side have\ngained steadily, drawing on a constant stream of migrating workers from southern Mexico and\ncomplementary component and material suppliers on the U.S. side. While the emphasis is still\nindustrial on the Mexican side, the U.S. side is a services economy, with retail and health care\nmaking significant gains in jobs and activity here in South Texas. Why? Job growth and a strong\npeso have improved the purchasing power of the Mexican consumer. Texas’ proximity to\nMonterrey, Mexico’s second wealthiest city, and prosperous maquiladoras along the border have\nalso meant an increase in shopping trips to Texas. This is not news to anyone in this room.\nBetween 1978 and 2001, Mexican nationals accounted for an estimated 53 percent of Laredo’s\nretail sales.\nA positive development along the border has been an explosion in its health care industry over\nthe past 10 years. Like retail and banking, health care is a service that is in demand by Mexican\nnationals and by the burgeoning population of U.S. retirees in Mexico. Hospitals and home\nhealth care agencies are expanding at rapid rates and, along with growth in education and federal\ngovernment jobs in Border Patrol and Customs, are providing high-paying employment to border\nresidents.\nWhile almost all Texas border cities have deep ties with Mexico, their linkages can be quite\ndifferent, and their economies respond accordingly to changing conditions in Mexico. Our\nresearch has found that, typically, sharp declines in the peso result in economic downturns in\nLaredo, McAllen and Brownsville. Each has retail sectors that depend heavily on Mexican\nshoppers, so swings in the peso can have big impacts. The strong and stable peso—thanks to the\n1994 constitutional reform that gave Banco de México the independence it has so ably applied in\nrecent years—is a big piece of the puzzle that explains robust growth in Laredo and the Valley.\n\n6\n\n\fThe outlook continues to be favorable for border population and job growth, both in Texas and\nthe states to our west. Real progress, however, will require greater productivity and increased\nwages. The ultimate source of income growth and prosperity originates with human capacity and\neducation, the development of which should be the highest priority of this community. It should\nbe the highest priority of this state.\nEducation and Immigrants\nWe never know enough in today’s world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the\nAmerican Dream. Our chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Mike Cox, likes to say, “You earn what\nyou learn.” The U.S. economy today is far different from the one that employed our parents and\ngrandparents in the fields and factories. Agriculture represents 2 percent of our national\neconomy. Manufacturing employs only 11 percent of our workforce. Construction and mining\nrepresent 5 percent. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a\nsprawling sector that includes some of the nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs.\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that “there are three\nkinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t.” Yet even mathematically\nchallenged economists are united on this: Education pays off. There is an irrefutable positive link\nbetween education and income. Wages are low on the border because education levels are low.\nWe see this link across states, across countries, between individuals and in America’s progress\nover time.\nSpending on education is an investment in our children. But that takes time, and we in Texas and\nthe U.S. have meanwhile added to our intellectual capital in another way. We import educated\nworkers from other countries and do what we can to retain foreign students who come to study\nhere. Along the U.S.–Mexico border, you know this well. Throughout its history, the region has\nbenefited from tapping the human capital of northern Mexico’s border states, which have some\nof Mexico’s finest universities.\nLet me give you an example of the “you earn what you learn” principle from our San Antonio\nbranch board of directors. To do so, I am going to embarrass Dr. G. P. Singh, who is an\nAmerican success story, combining education with entrepreneurship. As a boy in his native\nIndia, G. P. studied diligently, earning a spot in the Punjab Engineering College. Like so many\nforeigners, he continued his education in the U.S., earning a doctorate at Drexel University. In\ntime, Dr. Singh came to San Antonio and started his own engineering business—Karta\nTechnologies—a company he just sold for a cool $65 million.\nDr. Singh’s is a perfect example of how immigrant-founded firms are furthering the\ntechnological prowess of the U.S. economy. According to a recent study by researchers at Duke\nUniversity and UC Berkeley, immigrants were listed as inventors or co-inventors on 24 percent\nof all U.S. patent applications in 2006, up from only 7 percent in 1998. Of all the science and\ntechnology companies established in the United States between 1995 and 2005, 25 percent had at\nleast one foreign-born founder.\nMost important, G. P. is a case study of how to convert learning to earning and how to harness\nthe brain to create economic prosperity. We must foster conditions that allow a child from\nLaredo—or from any other city in Texas or the U.S. or from Mexico City or Nuevo Laredo or\n7\n\n\ffrom Punjab in faraway India—to succeed in the economic promised land called America. With\na well-educated workforce, no market correction, no interruption of the orderly working of\nfinancial markets and no apocryphal prognostication of the “instant analysts” or even of\nhumorless economists can dislodge us from our position as the world’s mightiest economic\nmachine.\nWith that, I will end today’s sermon.\nAnd now in keeping with Federal Reserve tradition, I would be happy to not answer any\nquestions you might have.\nAndamos, pues. Thank you.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi\nAugust 25, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fThe Southern States in a Globalized Economy\nRichard W. Fisher\nThank you, Governor Barbour. I was rather enjoying your introduction until you mentioned the\n1994 Senate race, a misguided adventure from a previous life. We at the Fed are sticklers for\naccurate data, so I need to issue a correction: I received 1,639,615 votes in 1994, which\ncomputes to 38.309 percent—roughly. About the only thing I was able to accomplish in that race\nwas eating a dipped cone in every Dairy Queen in the Lone Star State—all 700-plus of them.\nTexas ended up with a fine senator in Kay Hutchison and, despite all those ice cream cones and\nHunger-Busters, I managed to shed 20 pounds. It was a win–win experience. At least that’s my\nstory and I’m sticking to it.\nYou all know that we at the Fed are nonpartisan. Once you enter the “Temple,” as some call it,\nyou check your politics at the door. I joined up a couple of years ago and, like all Fed presidents,\nhave refrained from political commentary since crossing that threshold. But I think it right and\nproper to say that what you have done here, Governor, in Biloxi and throughout Mississippi in\nthe aftermath of Katrina’s fury is impressive. I am honored to have been introduced by you and\nto meet with the Southern Governors’ Association.\nMy district covers Texas, 26 parishes in Governor Blanco’s state and 18 counties in New\nMexico. It is a productive district, just like those covered by the Atlanta Fed and the St. Louis\nFed—by Dennis’s [Lockhart] and Bill’s [Poole] banks—and the Richmond, Cleveland and\nKansas City Feds, all of which have portions of the Greater South in their districts but are not\nrepresented here today. The governors of the Southern states, along with Dennis and Bill and me,\nwith Jeff Lacker in Richmond, Sandy Pianalto in Cleveland and Tom Hoenig in Kansas City,\nserve a mighty swath of the U.S. economy. The American public reads almost daily about the\ngreat economic power rising on the far side of the Pacific. Well, you might remind your\nconstituents and the press every now and then that the 16 states that you govern and that my\ncolleagues and I serve, all told, produce a combined output that is 76 percent greater than\nChina’s. Let me do the calculation in a different way: For every dollar’s worth of output that\nChina produces, the hardworking constituents of your states produce $1.76. The South is an\neconomic juggernaut.\nHow do we keep growing this mighty economic force? How does the South stay ahead of China\nand India and all the others who are knocking at the door, wanting economic prosperity?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that we live in a cyber-enhanced, interconnected, inextricably\ninterdependent global economy. The Southern economy is no longer confined by lines drawn on\na map; it is no more removed from countries and markets at the far ends of the Earth than it is\nfrom the rest of the United States. We live in a globalized economy, knitted together by\nKnowledge Age technologies. Until the Industrial Revolution, economies were largely local,\nconfined mostly to cities and towns. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker were\nwithin a day’s walk or horseback ride. Then came railroads, industry, telephones, cars, highways,\ntelevision and the Internet. With each successive technological innovation, our economic\nactivities expanded beyond our towns and states and regions, allowing us more choices in\ndetermining our destinies and bringing more difficulties in devising local and regional\n1\n\n\fgovernment economic policies. Sir Anthony Eden, the prime minister who succeeded Winston\nChurchill, said to the House of Commons in 1945, “Every succeeding scientific discovery makes\ngreater nonsense of old-time conceptions of sovereignty.” He was dead-on.\nWhat happens around the world affects us in the Southern states, just as what happens in each of\nyour states influences investment decisions and economic activity around the world. We all\nknow how devastating a fierce hurricane can be at the local level, destroying homes and\nbusinesses and disrupting millions of lives. Dislocations caused by a storm in the U.S. ripple\naround the globe: The Gulf’s vast oil and gas activity shuts down, causing world energy prices to\nrise and leaving drivers in Boston, Bulgaria and Brazil with less money in their pockets.\nWhen a Mississippi manufacturing company closes its Gulfport factory and moves it to\nGuangdong, China, in pursuit of lowering its costs, it hurts. The press, with its local emphasis,\nfocuses on the downside. And you, as governors, feel the brunt of your citizens’ anger. And yet\nyou know and I know that Chinese workers at that new factory many thousands of miles from\nhere now make more money than they did before. As they grow more prosperous, the Chinese\ncan afford to consume more, and so they start spending their hard-earned yuan at the\nneighborhood Wal-Mart—good news for Governor Beebe—or on bottles of Jack Daniel’s—\ngood news for Governor Bredesen—or perhaps on once-in-a-lifetime vacations to Disney\nWorld—good news for Governor Crist—or on soybeans grown in Texas—good news for my\nfriend Governor Perry, who is well aware that China is one of the fastest-growing destinations\nfor shipments leaving Houston’s port. So intertwined are the world’s economies that\ndisentangling the web would be, as Bill Poole just pointed out, disastrously expensive,\ncounterproductive and entirely fruitless. It takes extraordinary political leadership to\naccommodate globalization.\nOver the decades, the inexorable march of capitalist evolution has shifted our economy’s base\nfrom agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. This is important to understand as we\ncontemplate the South’s future. As people get richer, they shift their spending away from goods\nand toward services. For every dollar Americans spend on goods, we spend $1.70 on services.\nOurs is not a goods-based economy anymore—we grow and ship to the world a veritable\ncornucopia of crops, but agriculture represents only 1.5 percent of our economy. We build at a\nfurious pace and mine our rich store of natural resources, but construction and mining represent\nonly 5.5 percent of our economy. We are a manufacturing powerhouse, and yet factory output\nrepresents only around 11 percent of our economy. Services account for 82 percent of our\neconomic output. Let me repeat that: 82 percent of our economic output comes from the service\nsector.\nGiven your professional background, Mr. Chairman, you may be interested in one fact that\nillustrates the importance of the service sector: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts\nmanufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent to our GDP.\nThe legal services sector had nearly the same workforce—a little over a million lawyers inhabit\nAmerica—but they contributed 1.5 percent to GDP. Lawyers produce twice as much as\nautomobile workers. So much for lawyer jokes.\nObviously, services differ from goods in the job skills they require. Physical strength and manual\ndexterity, workers’ primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and\nmanufacturing eras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We\n2\n\n\fprosper by the work of our brow, not the labor of our muscle. The capital stock of our modern\neconomy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms. It is our brains. It is our ability to\nthink of new ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our commitment to customer service at this fine\nresort and millions of other places. It is our designs for new buildings, new computers or a space\nmodule. It manifests itself in new financing products or medical breakthroughs or the\nentertainment industry.\nThe great economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term creative destruction. This seemingly\ncontradictory phrase comes, by the way, from an economist who had a knack for the clever quip.\nOne of our former Fed governors, Dewey Daane, is a constituent of Governor Bredesen. He lives\nup there in Nashville. As a Harvard student back in the 1940s, he was taught by Schumpeter. He\nreports that the first day of class, Schumpeter walked in the room and said: “When I was young, I\nwanted to be the greatest economist in the world, the world’s greatest lover and the best\nhorseman on earth. I have not done well with the horses.”\nIn his pursuit of the first of those three grand goals, Professor Schumpeter wrote that “stabilized\ncapitalism is a contradiction in terms.” He was right: Capitalism is far from stable, and it is never\ndull. It is constantly transforming the economic landscape. And the American genius has time\nand again mastered that transformation—rather than be victimized by it.\nThe destructive side of capitalism’s creative destruction is evident in lost jobs. Let me share a\nfew numbers for the states you govern. The number of workers in apparel manufacturing in your\nstates decreased 80 percent between 1990 and 2005. In the same 15-year period, payrolls fell 18\npercent at paper manufacturers and 15 percent for furniture makers. The number of farm workers\ndecreased 6 percent, and the number of mine workers declined 5 percent. That is pretty painful\nstuff. And it is not ancient history. It all occurred within a time frame that is fresh in the memory\nof everyone in this room—between 1990 and 2005.\nAnd yet, despite these employment losses, each state in the Southern region now has a larger job\nbase than it did in 1990. North Carolina, for example, has created 1 million net new jobs since\n1990. Texas’ employment has risen by more than 3 million since 1990.\nWhy? Because the creative side of creative destruction outpaced the destructive side. Your\neconomies replaced lost jobs in declining sectors with new ones in emerging, higher-value-added\nsectors. Between 1990 and 2005, the number of data processing and Internet service provider\nworkers in Southern states increased 65 percent. Professional services workers grew 63 percent.\nFinancial services employees increased 31 percent. Retail employment grew 23 percent. By\n2005, the financial and real estate services sectors employed as many Southern workers as the\nmanufacturing sector. Lodging and food services accounted for the same share of the Southern\nworkforce as construction.\nHealth care sector employment in the South alone grew by 2.3 million from 1990 to 2005. Let\nme put that in perspective: For every manufacturing job lost in the Southern states between 1990\nand 2005, the health care sector created 2.4 new jobs.\nYes, we are losing jobs in the goods-producing parts of the economy to faraway lands. But we\nare gaining them in the service sector and net—net—we are creating more jobs than we are\nlosing.\n3\n\n\fA good friend of mine, Dr. Jonathan Weissler, is chief of medicine and holds the chair in\npulmonary research at the University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in my\nhometown of Dallas. We have coffee together in the mornings at our local Starbucks—come to\nthink of it, another globalized service provider.\nAfter we have our coffee, Dr. Weissler goes to his office where, like most doctors, he examines\npatients and then dictates notes into a recorder. The recording is transcribed into the patient’s\nfile. There is nothing startling there; this has been standard medical practice for decades. What is\nnew—and what is fast becoming a hallmark of the globalizing economy—is that he no longer\npays an on-site employee in Dallas to transcribe his dictation. Instead, Dr. Weissler simply clicks\na mouse and sends the recording to a company that farms the transcribing work out to English\nspeakers around the world. While Dr. Weissler sleeps, the notes are typed up overnight in\nBangalore for a fraction of the cost and arrive on the good doctor’s desktop by morning.\nIncidentally, Dr. Weissler says he can tell when the transcripts are produced in India because the\nEnglish is perfect and even the most complex medical terms are spelled correctly—a testimony\nto India’s teaching of proper English in their schools.\nBy reducing costs and streamlining his recordkeeping in this way, Dr. Weissler’s practice runs\nmore efficiently and his staff can devote more time to serving patients and growing his practice.\nThe real payoff is that money saved in offshoring transcription can be reinvested into researching\nnew ways to save and improve American lives.\nDr. Weissler is harnessing and harvesting globalization. What makes this possible? Cyberspace\nand globalization. The Net and fiber-optic cable give him the ability to access, coordinate,\nmanage and control resources around the world without regard to distance, borders or time\nzones.\nThere are counterparts to Dr. Weissler in every one of your states. As globalization continues\nand the world economy evolves, more creative destruction will impact your states. That is the\nbad news because job destruction creates political pressures for transition programs at best and\nprotectionist or retaliatory responses at worst. The good news is that the creative side of this\ninexorable phenomenon, properly managed, results in better jobs, higher living standards, lower\nprices and increased prosperity.\nI echo Bill Poole’s message: The answer is not protectionism. Rather than labor fruitlessly to\nprotect your constituents from foreign competition, you and your legislatures must prepare them\nfor it. Use your extraordinary talents as leaders to provide the transition mechanisms that will\nenable them to retool and move up the value-added ladder into higher-paying jobs.\nThere is no great secret about how to lay the groundwork for Southern states’ success in\nharvesting and harnessing—in mastering—globalization. The key to adapting to and profiting\nfrom globalization lies in education. Texas boomed on the discovery of oil. Now we thrive on the\noutput of the human mind. If you look around Dallas and Houston, you see office buildings, not\noil wells or factories. Those buildings warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human\nbrains. Brains that research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad\nother services. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n4\n\n\fJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once propelled the development of the\nSouthern states, an educated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of your\nstates, our great nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is\nnot oil and gas or the chemical industry or this widget or that or even the Dallas Cowboys or the\nSan Antonio Spurs (even if they are the good Lord’s favorite teams)—it is our elementary and\nsecondary schools, and the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M in College Station, Rice\nUniversity in Houston, Southwestern Medical and Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and\nour law and engineering schools and research centers. Each of you could say that for your states.\nThe development of human capacity through education should be the highest policy priority of\nany government in the South or anywhere else.\nWhen I ran for the Senate, I was told to make every effort to condense complex thoughts and\nideas into simple catchall phrases. I obviously wasn’t very good at it. And, as politicians\nyourselves, you know meaningful brevity is not an easy task. Nor one that everyone appreciates.\nPundits deride the catchy line as “bumper sticker” politics. I am not running for anything, so I’ll\nrisk offering a bumper sticker for our times, one delivering this simple message: “You earn what\nyou learn.”\nAs I said at the outset, the South is a mighty economic machine. To remain powerful and\nprosperous, we need to move faster and farther up the educational ladder. The Chinese and the\nIndians and the Vietnamese and Eastern Europeans and Latin Americans are taking possession of\nthe lower rungs of the world economy. There are 3 billion or more fervent wannabe capitalists\namong them who want to be rich like us. We cannot stop them, nor should we bother trying. But\nwe must stay ahead of them. The key to doing so lies in developing our citizens’ brainpower.\nThe human brain is the capital plant of the Knowledge Age. Education is the fuel for that plant.\nThe living standards of your constituents will be determined by what they learn. So my best\nadvice for you as governors is to throw your weight and your budget dollars behind education. It\nis an investment that provides unlimited returns. It is an investment that will secure our economic\nfuture.\nThank you.\n\n5\n\n\f"

            "content": "Higher Education in Texas\nRemarks to the Rotary Club of Dallas\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nJune 13, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fHigher Education in Texas\nRichard W. Fisher\nI love speaking to Rotarians, especially the Downtown Rotary. I was a member of this wonderful\nclub before I went off to serve in Washington in 1997. I loved every minute of it, especially the\npatriotism and the esprit de corps. I have always considered Rotarians the Marine Corps of the\ncivic community. Remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines? “Some people spend\nan entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don’t have that\nproblem.”\nNeither do Rotarians. You have taken Paul Harris’ vision and expanded upon and realized it,\nmaking every community in America better for it.\nI also love the Rotarian sense of humor. When I was a member, Carol Reed used to read the\n“news” to us at the beginning of every meeting here at Downtown Rotary. One of my all-time\nfavorites was about a man who had fallen into a river in Egypt and had managed to fight off an\nattack by a crocodile. The punch line, of course, was that if you didn’t believe a man could fend\noff a croc with his bare hands, then you yourself were in “de-Nile.”\nToday, I want to talk about another kind of denial. I am not going to talk about the economy or\nmonetary policy or interest rates. We can do that in the question-and-answer period after this\nsermon, if you wish. What I want to talk about is higher education. I want to focus on the\ntendency of Dallas to deny that we are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to\nproducing the academic and intellectual excellence needed to make Dallas the great city we all\nwant it to be.\nI have deliberately picked the Downtown Rotary Club to convey this message. Rotarians have a\nlong history of commitment to educational excellence, which has benefited countless\ncommunities in the U.S. and around the world. And, incidentally, it directly benefited the Federal\nReserve. Paul Volcker, the Zeus of central banking gods, the man who pulled this country back\nfrom the brink of economic catastrophe, studied at the London School of Economics as a Rotary\nScholar. I always speak for myself and for no other official of the Federal Reserve System.\nToday is no exception. But I think I am safe in saying the entire Federal Reserve holds Rotary in\nthe highest regard. We thank you for what you care about and what you do.\nI know that you care about education. I know that you do so much for Dallas. So let me get to the\npoint.\nDallas–Fort Worth is the eighth-most-populous metropolitan area in the country and the fifthmost economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population and productivity,\nsurpassed on both fronts only by California.\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of\nthem all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M\nSystem has nine universities with 103,000 students and a multicampus health science center. The\nremaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the\n1\n\n\fUniversity of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech\nSystem. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are each\nindependent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending the more\nthan 40 public universities in our state.\nBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities.\nThe granddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 209,000\nstudents spread over 10 universities.\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the\nUniversity of California System? Not a one of you. And that is because you know that in\naddition to Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine,\nUC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\nNow here is a fact. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA,\nUC San Diego and UC Irvine all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC\nDavis and UC Santa Barbara were tied with UT—at 47th. And the rest of our universities? Texas\nA&M was ranked 60th. SMU ranked 70th, Baylor 81st and TCU 105th. Rice was ranked 17th,\nright up there with Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\nHold that thought: The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one\nfleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our flagship.\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American\nUniversities, which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of\nresearch universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S.\nschools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars; they are home to 82 percent of all\nelected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering\nand the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1999, three\nquarters—74 percent—of all Nobel Prizes were won by individuals who were faculty members\nat AAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas\nuniversities included in this prestigious group of 60.\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa\nBarbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles\narea alone.\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook\nUniversity, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add\nan eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about; a state of 24\nmillion people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU\nmember universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Zip. Zero.\nNada. Dallas, the eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn’t have a single top-ranked\nacademic institution. We do have UT Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a\n2\n\n\fmedical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on\nadvanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\nHow can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future without a single elite university\nin our city? How can we expect Dallas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which\neconomic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and\nbiology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established\nfountainhead of advanced knowledge?\nOn Sunday, Tom Friedman of The New York Times reported an interesting observation by\nLucien Bronicki. An expert in geothermal energy in the Negev Desert, Bronicki met with\nFriedman at an Israeli university. Pointing to a roomful of students studying biomedical\nengineering, software development, electrical engineering and computing, Bronicki remarked:\n“These are our oil wells.” And Friedman added: “These are oil wells that don’t run dry.”\nEconomists may quibble about widgets and whatnot, but they are united on this: Education pays\noff. There’s an irrefutable positive link between education and income. We see it across\ncountries, between individuals, in America’s progress over time and when comparing states.\nLittle old Massachusetts, for example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita,\nhas lifted itself up to first in per capita income. California’s 11th-place ranking in education gets\nit 10th in per capita income. Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income,\nwell below the national leaders in college-educated workers and earnings. Our neighbor,\nArkansas, ranks 49th in both. Mississippi is 50th in income, competing with West Virginia,\nwhich is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to Arkansas in educational attainment\nand income than we are to Massachusetts. I’ve got nothing against Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the\nMountaineers, but that is not where I want Texas to be.\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. Tell me how\nmany factories you see. You won’t see any—at least not any of the old-fashioned kind with\nsmokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel\nbuildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains.\nThe brain is to the Knowledge Age what the motor was to the Industrial Age. And education is\nthe oil, the fuel that drives the knowledge economy forward.\nLately, we have been cooing and aahing over the Barnett Shale. We brag about the drilling rigs\nthat are popping up all around D/FW Airport. All that is great. We need all the homegrown gas\nproduction we can get. But when was the last time the public attention given one rig was\nlavished on a student like J. Bradford Cutrell, the summa cum laude graduate in microbiology\nfrom UT who graduated No. 1 in his class at UT Southwestern last week, winning the top\nacademic prize for having “a superlative medical mind”? Cutrell is an oil well. A homegrown\none from Sulphur Springs, Texas. One that will never run dry.\nWe need more of him. We need thousands upon thousands of Cutrells here in Dallas. We can\nfuel our economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other\ncountries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent,\nwith its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\n\n3\n\n\fWe never know enough in today’s world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the\nAmerican Dream. More and more, you earn what you learn. The U.S. economy today is far\ndifferent than the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and factories.\nAgriculture represents 2 percent of our national economy. Manufacturing employs only 11\npercent of our workforce. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a\nsprawling sector that includes some of the nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs. In\nTexas, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for internal medicine doctors, $44.81 for\ngeological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35 for registered nurses,\naccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. Those are handsome earnings statistics. We\nwant as many of our people as possible working in those income brackets.\nChina, the former USSR nations and India together have roughly the same number of college\ngrads age 25-plus as the U.S. does—about 54.1 million. There’s no way to stay ahead of the pack\nwithout constantly pushing to educate our citizens and also grabbing foreign graduates whenever\nwe can. But we do the opposite. We bring them over here, teach them everything we know—\noften with U.S.-financed scholarships and always at schools endowed with private U.S. monies\nand taxpayer funds—then send them back home by denying them citizenship! That has to be the\nmost ridiculous investment paradigm ever, anywhere. We are in essence financing their capital\nplant and denying ourselves a return on our investment. It is as though we are spending a million\ndollars to drill a well in the Barnett Shale and then giving away the gas we find.\nQuestion: How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans\nand Vietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who can grow and make stuff so much\ncheaper than we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they begin to move up the value-added\nladder into the service sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the\nsciences?\nNon-answer: by closing up our ports and protecting our economy. We know from the 1930s what\nthat does. Protectionism is a political prescription for economic ruin.\nAnswer: We stay ahead of our competitors. We move even faster up the value-added ladder.\nHow? By using our brains—that area my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart\njar between your ears.” Our brains are our capital equipment. The brain is to the Knowledge Age\nwhat oil and electricity and mass production were to the Manufacturing Age. We need to nurture\nand grow more Brad Cutrells. We need to attract and retain every foreign brain we can. We need\nto provide them with academic homes they will want to come to and then stay around and add\nvalue to. We need to house them right here in River City—right here in Dallas.\nIf any of you leave this room today willing to accept the fact that Dallas, Texas, does not have\none university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or the Association of\nAmerican Universities, then you are not the Rotarians whom I know and love. If any of you are\nwilling to accept that David Daniel at the University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at\nSouthern Methodist University or Kern Wildenthal at the University of Texas Southwestern\nMedical Center or Victor Boschini at Texas Christian University or Jim Spaniolo at the\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington is fighting with one hand tied behind his back because the\npowers that be in Texas cannot rise above parochialism and give to this city what California has\nin San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what\n4\n\n\fNew York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well, you, my friends, are in a serious\nstate of denial.\nAnd if you of all people, you as Rotarians, the Marines of civic life, cannot figure out a way for\nthis city to win on the battlefield of higher education, then woe is the future of our beloved\nDallas.\n\n5\n\n\f"

            "content": "Commencement Address at the\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern\nMedical Center\n\nRichard W. Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nJune 2, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fCommencement Address at the University of Texas Southwestern\nMedical Center\nRichard W. Fisher\nBefore I begin, I want all the candidates for degrees to do me a favor. Stand up, please. Now turn\naround. Look at all these people, over 2,000 of them. These are your parents, your spouses, your\nchildren, your lovers and friends, teachers and relatives. They have been at your side through\njoyful moments and less than joyful ones. They have encouraged you and badgered you as you\napproached and surmounted one hurdle after another in your remarkable lives. They have\nbelieved in you. And now they are here to celebrate with you the glorious commencement of\nyour lifetime commitment to practicing and researching and advancing the most honorable of\nprofessions: the application of medical science to curing the sick, saving lives and solving the\nmany unsolved mysteries of the body and mind.\nApplaud your admirers as they applaud you. Thank them for their love and support.\nNow, doctors to be, doctorates to be and medical scientist candidates, be seated.\nThe only thing that now stands between you and your degrees is … me. Before you walk across\nthis stage and receive your well-earned diplomas and go on to celebrate, you have to listen to me\nspeak, you poor souls. I promise to deliver a message that adheres to the underlying premise of\nboth our professions: I will do no harm.\nI was admitted into the “society of educated men and women” at Harvard 36 years ago, when I\nbecame the first university graduate in the history of my family. Thirty-six years ago!\nMuch has changed since then, but one thing hasn’t. And that is the value of a great education and\nthe celebration of its accomplishment.\nHow does a graduation speaker commemorate an event such as this? It is no easy thing.\nFor starters, there is the daunting task of appealing to such a broad diversity of backgrounds in\nthese graduating classes. Which brings to mind the film made by the intrepid band of renegades\nin the graduating class of M.D.’s, which I happened to see Wednesday night at Northpark. Yes, I\nsnuck into the screening of Medecins Sans Decence. I was especially intrigued by the bumper\nsticker and T-shirt logo. May I respectfully suggest that it be rewritten to read:\n“I (heart) va … riety.”\n…Which, by the way, your class represents more than adequately: You come from 22 states and\nfrom nine countries—Canada, China, Egypt, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and\n…Texas. You have your undergraduate degrees from 84 colleges and universities around the\nworld.\nHow does one prepare a commencement address for such an assortment of degree candidates\nwho share a common dedication but come from such diverse backgrounds?\n1\n\n\fWell, the standard routine is to dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to\nfind something said by some sage that puts the nobility of the profession you are about to enter in\na glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay from your undergraduate\ndays: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised to look like your own.1\nCommencement speeches are no different.\nHoping to find something profound that I might pinch and adapt for your amusement, I wandered\nthrough abridged versions of the great sayings about doctors and medicine by the great minds of\nthe ages—Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St. Augustine, Voltaire, Martin Luther, Albert Schweitzer\n… Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton. Alas, I found nothing that was both inspiring and repeatable in\nmixed company.\nActually, I exaggerate. I found one. In the immortal words of the philosopher king Woody Allen,\n“The greatest words in the English language are not ‘I love you.’ They are hearing your doctor\nsay, ‘It is benign.’” By the authority vested in the diploma you are about to receive, your words\nand actions will carry enormous weight in society. Hold that thought.\nThe next thing a graduation speaker tries to do is offer a memorable maxim—a homily or\nplatitude with which to send the graduating class off into a brave new world.\nGraduations are veritable festivals of maxims. Every commencement speaker dispenses them: Be\ndisciplined; be prepared; be loyal, be thrifty, be brave; don’t waste your talents; to thine own self\nbe true; question authority; take risks; push the envelope; a little rebellion every now and then is\na good thing; respect your fellow man; serve others; never compromise your integrity; be true to\nyourself and your country; never promise more than you can deliver; never forsake your\nprofessional obligation; never forget that you have been given talent to do good; never, never,\nnever, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\nThese are all good words. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a\ncommencement if the presidents of colleges or deans of schools would forgo the speaker and\nsimply remind the graduates to read or listen to the books-on-tape versions of the Bible or the\nKoran or Shakespeare or Confucius, the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I\nhave ever read or listened to. After all, for this ceremony tonight, it would be hard to improve\nupon the first line of the Analects of Confucius: “Is there no greater pleasure than to study and,\nin time, to practice what is studied?”2\nHow can you improve upon that for a group of scholars that has labored so diligently all these\nyears in the study of medicine and medical science? After you receive your degree on this stage\ntonight, you will go on to practice what you have studied for so many arduous years. Surely,\nthere is no greater pleasure: What you have learned here will now apply for real, forever.\nConsider yourself lucky because not all of us get to practice our studies. At Oxford, I read Latin\nAmerican history as a graduate student. I wrote countless essays on Joaquín Balaguer, the most\nprolific writer in the Dominican Republic. Essays with titles like “Joaquín Balaguer: Nemesis or\nPatron Saint of Naboth’s Vineyard?” You can bet I have spent countless hours kicking that one\naround with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\n2\n\n\fBut you are embarking on career paths that will enable you to convert your rigorous education at\nUT Southwestern into practice. Into noble practice. A practical application of education that\nserves mankind. So with what maxim might I contrive to send you forth into a world you will\nshape? How could I improve upon the wisdom of the ages? Not easily. I dug deep into my\nmemory banks and called upon a source more erudite than Shakespeare and more insightful than\neven Confucius—my mother.\nMy mother was a stoic Norwegian. She was raised in an outpost in South Africa, lost her father\nto the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the kind of education you\nand I have been so blessed to receive. Yet, she was a wise woman. She dispensed exquisite\npearls of wisdom to her children, a kind of female Nordic Yogi Berra. One is especially germane\nto this evening: “Never let your brains go to your head,” she said. The pun is horrific, but the\nmessage is profound: To achieve success you will need to keep your considerable talents in\nperspective.\nOscar Wilde said, “The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.”\nBeing possessed of genius, much is expected of you. Once you accept the diploma you are about\nto receive, you will be a doctor—a doctor of medicine, a doctor of philosophy, an authority in\nmedical science. You will have special obligations. Your patients and your collaborators will\nrely on everything you do and say. People will put into your hands their most precious\npossessions—their lives, their children’s lives, the lives of their parents, their colleagues and\ntheir employees. Enormous faith will be vested in your genius. Science will look to you to solve\nriddles heretofore unsolved. Even economists will look to you to find ways to escape the Sword\nof Damocles that shortsighted politicians have placed above our collective heads in the form of\nMedicare and other entitlement schemes, constructed without thought to their corrosive ultimate\ncost.\nYou will be looked to for answers. Your answers will be considered thoughtful and wise. “The\ngreatest words are hearing your doctor say, ‘It is benign.’” Or, if it is not benign, “We can cure\nthis.” Or, “We can ease your pain.” Or, “We have found a cure,” perhaps for AIDS or\ntuberculosis or Alzheimer’s or cancer or avian flu. You have the power to cure, to heal, to save.\nUse it wisely.\nUsing it wisely requires recognizing that having brains and years of superior training is necessary\nbut insufficient for success.\nTime and time again, in research labs, in clinics, in universities and corporations and government\noffices—even supranational institutions like the World Bank—we see instances where men and\nwomen of towering intellect fail because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient\nwith the same devotion they have applied to harnessing and channeling their intellectual\nquotient. My heartfelt advice to you is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have in\ndeveloping your IQ.\nYou have reached the pinnacle of your formal education, the ultimate validation of your IQ (or\nthe penultimate for those of you who go on to join the Academy of Sciences or become Nobel\nlaureates or honored members of one distinguished medical society or another, which I’ll bet\nmost of you will do). You will get there just as fast and enjoy it more if you remember that a\nsound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, well3\n\n\frounded person has more than a superior brain. The whole person is as important an achievement\nfor those privileged few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and women” as\nis the achievement of intellectual excellence.\nWhich brings me to the third and last requirement for a commencement oration—a smattering of\nLatin. I’ll wrap up with this: “Bubbus, sed possum explicare. Non sed possum comprehendere.”\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texan Latin for\n“Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\nThis evening, I have done my best to explain that true success comes to those who best put their\ntalents in context and who connect a substantial intellect to an equally developed emotional\ncapacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly strive to elevate our “people skills”\nto a level equal to our intellectual skills. That’s the bottom line. I can explain it to you. But you\nmust come to understand it on your own.\nAnd now, in deference to the iconic economist John Maynard Keynes, who reminded us all that\ndespite the great efforts of devoted doctors and medical scientists, “in the long run, we are all\ndead,” and mindful that most of you want to get on and party, I say, “Bibamus, moriendum est.”\nDeath is unavoidable. So let’s have a drink! (In moderation, of course.)\nI look forward with great pleasure to having a drink with you after you receive your welldeserved degrees and to toasting your achievement and success.\n\n1\n\nIf memory serves from my days at Oxford, this observation was noted by Graham Chapman,\none of the stalwarts of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.\n2\n\nThe literal translation, per Professor William Kirby, director of the John King Fairbank Center\nfor East Asian Research of Harvard University, is: “To study, and in time to put into practice\nwhat is studied, is this not a pleasure?”\n\n4\n\n\f"

Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nDallas, Texas\nMay 24, 2007\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fIntroductory Remarks to the Price Measurement for\nMonetary Policy Conference\nRichard W. Fisher\nThis conference on inflation measurement has been jointly organized by Mark Wynne and Jim\nDolmas of the Dallas Fed and David Altig and Michael Bryan of the Cleveland Fed. For their\ndedicated effort and superb accomplishment in getting participants and presenters from over 21\ncountries, I am most grateful.\nThe presentations today are devoted mainly to the question of core inflation measurement, while\nthe presentations tomorrow will look at various approaches to the measurement of expected\ninflation.\nDuring the next two days, we will hear presentations by leading students of the subject—\nacademics and economists from the Federal Reserve System and participants and presenters from\na number of other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank for International\nSettlements, Bank of Italy, National Bank of Belgium, Reserve Bank of Australia and National\nBank of Poland. Governor Mishkin will be the keynote speaker at tonight’s dinner.\nThe discussants, who play an equally important role in determining the success of a conference\nlike this, have been drawn from the Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Feds, as well as\nfrom the Bank of Canada, IMF, Bank of Mexico, Bank of Sweden, Brandeis University, the\nUniversity of Illinois and London Business School. We also have people attending from the\nReserve Bank of New Zealand, Bank of Iceland, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank,\nNational Bank of Romania, Bank of Korea and the Central Bank of the Netherlands, among\nothers, along with many local area academics.\nAll in all, we have a very diverse group participating in this conference. For those of you who\nhave come from afar, we welcome you. Texas is a very friendly place. We are honored that you\nare here, and we hope you will enjoy our hospitality.\nThe first paper this morning will be presented by Diana Weymark of Vanderbilt University. The\npaper looks at ways of constructing operational measures of inflation pressure and specifically\nproposes three new indexes for measuring such pressure, the extent to which such pressure is\nalleviated and the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing expected inflation. One of the\ninteresting findings of the paper is that the proposed indexes show the extent to which the Fed\nunder Chairman Greenspan consistently resisted inflationary pressures and capitalized on\ndeflationary pressures to bring inflation down whenever the opportunity arose.\nProfessor Weymark’s paper will be followed by a paper by Julie Smith of Lafayette College.\nProfessor Smith is one of the few academic experts who continue to think about ways of coming\nup with better measures of core inflation, and indeed, that is the title of her presentation. In her\nview, core inflation should be defined as the measure of inflation that best predicts future\ninflation. The central idea in her paper is that core inflation should be measured by adding up the\ncomponents of the PCE deflator, but weighting them according to how they behave over time.\n1\n\n\fOne of our main criticisms here at the Dallas Fed of much of the core inflation literature is that it\nlacks theoretical coherence. It reminds me of the time-honored saying that an economist is\nsomeone who sees something work in practice and then wonders if it can work in theory.\nToday’s third paper, presented by Stefano Siviero of the Bank of Italy, tries to address this issue\nby proposing a measure of core inflation that weights individual prices on the basis of their\nusefulness in helping the central bank achieve its goal of price stability. One of the interesting\nfindings of the paper is that a central bank that responds to the traditional “ex-food and energy”\nmeasure of core inflation does no better than one that responds to headline inflation. This raises\nimportant questions about the utility of the core measure in policy deliberations.\nMeasuring core inflation can get quite technical, and the fourth paper for today, presented by\nRichard Anderson of the St. Louis Fed, is an excellent example in this regard. I won’t try to\nsummarize it for you unless you have a strong desire to learn about “wavelets” from someone\nwhose closest encounter with them was while surfing as a teenager. The central idea in the paper\ngoes way back to the great 19th century Irish economist Francis Edgeworth, who proposed that\nwhen calculating overall inflation, individual prices should be weighted not by their share in\naggregate expenditure but rather by their volatility, with more volatile prices getting a smaller\nweight in the overall index.\nThe trimmed mean approach to core measurement, which is the way the Dallas Fed prefers to\nevaluate inflation, is analyzed at some length in the two papers that follow. One, by a pioneer in\nthis line of research, Mike Bryan of the Cleveland Fed, argues that the trimmed mean approach is\nparticularly good at detecting shifts in trend inflation in low-inflation environments. The other,\nby Anthony Richards of the Reserve Bank of Australia, provides additional evidence on the\nsuperior performance of trimmed mean measures using data for the U.S., euro area, Japan and\nAustralia. One innovation in this paper is to break up the owners’ equivalent rent (OER)\ncomponent of the U.S. CPI along regional lines to further improve the performance of the\ntrimmed mean.\nBut lest you think that that settles the debate in favor of the trimmed mean approach, the last\npaper today, by New York Fed economists Robert Rich and Charles Steindel, casts doubt on the\nusefulness of any core measure. Their point is that the superior performance of various measures\nis very sensitive to the sample period being looked at; some measures do well in some periods\nand some do well in others, leaving little basis for trusting in one measure at all times.\nTomorrow, the conference will look at various approaches to the measurement of inflation\nexpectations. The first two papers, to be presented by Stefania D’Amico of the Board of\nGovernors and Oreste Tristani of the ECB, look at how we can use the prices of financial\ninstruments to make inferences about inflation expectations. Dr. D’Amico and her fellow\ncoauthors at the Board of Governors find that the TIPS break-even rate is a useful proxy for\ninflation expectations in the U.S., despite the fact that the yield on TIPS is known to contain a\nsignificant liquidity premium. Dr. Tristani and his coauthor from the Bank of International\nSettlements are concerned with the interpretation of term premia in the euro area and find that\nthese premia seem to reflect primarily real rather than inflation risks.\nAn alternative approach to measuring inflation expectations is to simply go out and ask people\nwhat they think inflation is going to be over the next year or two or 10. Our very own Mark\n2\n\n\fWynne spent a good deal of time working at the European Central Bank on the European\nMonetary Union. One of his enduring contributions to the EMU was to design the ECB’s Survey\nof Professional Forecasters, which is now featured every three months in the ECB’s Monthly\nBulletin. Two papers on Friday, one presented by economist Juan Angel García of the ECB and\nanother by Aidan Meyler, also of the ECB, will look at the usefulness and track record of this\nsurvey and the similar one that is run by the Philadelphia Fed. Well-designed surveys of\nforecasters can shed light on inflation risks, a topic of perennial interest to central bankers.\nOf course, it is not just the expectations of professional forecasters that should be of interest to\ncentral bankers. The inflation expectations of firms and households matter as well. The\npenultimate paper of the conference, by three economists from the Polish central bank and\npresented tomorrow by author Ryszard Kokoszcynski, will look at the performance of measures\nof household inflation expectations in a group of central European countries. One of the\nproblems with the European Commission’s survey of household inflation expectations is that it\nelicits qualitative rather than quantitative information, and these responses then need to be\nfurther “massaged” before they can be used in assessing the inflation outlook.\nIn addition to asking households about inflation expectations, the European Commission survey\nalso asks about inflation perceptions. Normally the perceived rates of inflation in the EU and the\nrates measured by statisticians track each other quite well. But at the time of the euro cash\nchangeover, there was a huge discrepancy between what the statisticians were measuring and\nwhat households said they were experiencing, raising questions about the credibility of the\nofficial inflation measures. The final paper of the conference, presented by Marianne Collin of\nthe National Bank of Belgium, looks at what happened and concludes that there was simply a\nstructural break in the relationship between measured and perceived inflation at the time of the\ncash changeover.\nThat is the menu for this feast of thought. I hope you enjoy the discussions and that all of us who\nare privileged to partake in this conference will leave with renewed vigor and determination to\nbetter understand inflation and use that understanding to inform those of us who have\nresponsibility for making monetary policy.\n\n3\n\n\f"
