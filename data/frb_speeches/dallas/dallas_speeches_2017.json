        "content": "A Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\n\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nNovember 27, 2017\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nWilliam Simmons, Dianne Tunnell and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\n\nBackground\nThe target federal funds rate stands in a range of 100 to 125 basis points. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the federal funds rate in March as well as June of this year. I voted for\nboth of these increases. I also supported the FOMC’s decision in September to begin the process\nof gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I believe that the gradual and\nphased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the size of its Treasury and mortgagebacked securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important markets.\n\nBalancing Full Employment and Price Stability\nAs of November 2017, several key labor market indicators suggest that the U.S. economy is at or\nnear full employment. The headline unemployment rate and other measures of labor market\nutilization are now at or below pre-recession lows. In addition, Dallas Fed economists expect the\nU.S. economy to continue to grow at rates which should cause labor market conditions to tighten\nfurther. While real wage growth has been sluggish, we are beginning to see welcome signs of\nincreasing wage pressures which are consistent with removal of remaining slack from the labor\nmarket.\nInflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Moreover, the 12-month\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE, a measure of core inflation (which Dallas Fed economists believe\nprovides a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends than headline readings), started the\nyear at 1.9 percent and has drifted down to 1.6 percent in the latest reading. While some of this\nrecent decline is likely transitory, my view is that some of the more persistent weakness is due to\nstructural forces, which are limiting the pricing power of businesses and are likely having a muting\neffect on wage pressures for certain types of workers. These structural forces include technologyenabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization (see Appendix A, Technology-Enabled\nDisruption and Its Implications).\nHow should the FOMC address the current situation in which one aspect of our mandate is being\nmet while another objective is not yet being met? In this essay, I intend to address this question.\nThe Fed’s Mandate\nTo help the public understand its framework for monetary policy, the FOMC released in January\n2012, and reaffirmed in January 2017, its “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.”1 This document articulates the FOMC’s commitment to fulfilling its statutory mandate\n2\n\n\ffrom Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest\nrates.\nIn public discussions, Fed officials typically express this framework as a “dual mandate”—full\nemployment and price stability. The Fed uses a variety of economic and labor market indicators\nto judge whether the full employment objective is being met. To judge whether the price stability\nobjective is being met, the FOMC has articulated a “symmetric” inflation goal of 2 percent, as\nmeasured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\nThe term “symmetric” means that the FOMC would be equally concerned if inflation ran either\npersistently above or persistently below this 2 percent objective.\nThese dual-mandate longer-term goals are generally complementary. However, in those cases\nwhere they are not, the FOMC has said that it will seek to follow a “balanced approach” in\npromoting these goals, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially\ndifferent time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels\njudged consistent with its mandate.\n\nThe Current Situation\nAs we sit here today, the headline unemployment rate stands at approximately 4.1 percent. In\naddition, our Dallas Fed economists also look at the U-6 rate, a broader measure that includes the\npercent of unemployed, plus the number of discouraged workers, plus people working part time\nwho want to work full time. This measure of labor market utilization now stands at approximately\n7.9 percent, matching its prerecession low.\nIn addition, we also look closely at the labor force participation rate (the number of employed plus\nunemployed looking for a job as a percentage of the population 16 and older), which now stands\nat 62.7 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population and, as\nsuch, we believe that current participation levels are consistent with an economy that is at or near\nfull employment. Looking ahead, Dallas Fed economists expect this aging trend to continue in the\nU.S., as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline further to 61 percent.2 This aging trend will likely reduce the rate of labor force growth\nin the United States. Because GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in\nlabor productivity, weaker expected workforce growth is likely to negatively affect potential GDP\ngrowth in the years ahead—unless steps are taken to mitigate these effects.\nThe question arises as to the actual level of maximum sustainable employment, which can be\ndefined as the maximum level of employment that does not generate undue price pressures.\nBecause inflation pressures typically manifest themselves with a lag, this is a judgment that is\nmuch easier to make in hindsight than in real time. Having said this, Dallas Fed economists\n3\n\n\fcurrently believe that we are either at or near the level of maximum sustainable employment, and\nmay well move materially beyond maximum sustainable employment sometime in 2018.\nRegarding inflation, we have been notably running behind our 2 percent target for the past several\nyears. My own view has been that, while cyclical inflationary pressures are building, which should\nbecome more apparent over time, these pressures are being at least partially offset by the structural\nheadwinds of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A) and, to a lesser extent,\nglobalization. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that, as labor market conditions continue to\ntighten, cyclical inflationary forces should ultimately offset these structural headwinds such that\nwe will likely achieve our 2 percent target in the medium term. We are of course mindful that\nprogress in reaching our inflation mandate may well be slower and more uneven than many\nanalysts currently anticipate.\nIn summary, as a policymaker, I am balancing a labor market that is likely to become increasingly\noverheated in the months ahead with a level of inflation that is running somewhat below our 2\npercent goal. While I believe cyclical inflationary forces are building, there is some question\nregarding how long it will take to reach our price stability objective.\n\nMonitoring for Evidence of Building Imbalances\nAs a central banker, I want to be vigilant to imbalances and distortions that can build as a result of\naccommodative monetary policy. I have argued that monetary policy accommodation is not “free”\n—there are costs to accommodation in the form of distortions and imbalances in consumer\ndecisions as well as in investing, hiring and other business decisions. More specifically, experience\nsuggests that the greater the overshoot of full employment, the more difficult it is to unwind\nimbalances when growth ultimately slows—as it certainly must.\nWhen excesses ultimately need to be unwound, this can result in a sudden downward shift in\ndemand for investment and consumer related durable goods. There are surprisingly few historical\nexamples of “soft landings” in cases where employment has risen above its maximum sustainable\nlevel.\nIt is of course possible that “this time will be different,” but as I assess the condition of the U.S.\neconomy, I am carefully monitoring evidence that might suggest growing risks of real imbalances,\nwhich could threaten the sustainability of the current economic expansion. For example, the\nheadline unemployment rate has fallen by 70 basis points over the past year, nearly matching the\naverage rate of decline over the prior seven years of the expansion. If this rate of decline continues,\nthis will further tighten labor market conditions and would likely add to excesses and imbalances\naccumulating in the economy.\nExcesses can also manifest themselves in financial imbalances. While I would prefer to rely\nprimarily on macroprudential policy tools to manage financial imbalances, I am nevertheless\nmonitoring various measures of potential financial excess. I monitor these and other market\n4\n\n\fmeasures because I am aware that, as excesses build, we are more vulnerable to reversals which\nhave the potential to cause a rapid tightening in financial conditions, which in turn, can lead to a\nslowing in economic activity. Examples of potential excesses might include:\n\n\nThe U.S. stock market capitalization now stands at approximately 135 percent of GDP, the\nhighest since 1999/2000.3 Correspondingly, commercial real estate cap rates and valuation\nmeasures of debt and other markets appear notably extended.\n\n\n\nMeasures of stock market volatility are historically low.4 We have now gone 12 months\nwithout a 3 percent correction in the U.S. market.5 This is extraordinarily unusual.\n\n\n\nWhile household debt to GDP has improved over the past eight years, corporate debt is\nnow at record highs.6 I am not overly concerned about current levels of corporate debt\nbecause, importantly, financial sector leverage has declined substantially since the Great\nRecession. However, U.S. government debt now stands at approximately 75 percent of\nGDP,7 and the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $49\ntrillion.8 In my view, the projected path of U.S. government debt to GDP is unlikely to be\nsustainable—and has been made to appear more manageable due to today’s historically\nlow interest rates.\n\n\n\nDebt and equity securities trading volumes have markedly declined over the past several\nyears. For example, NYSE equity trading volume on average for 2017 is down 51 percent\nfrom 2007 levels, while the NYSE market cap has increased 28 percent over the same time\nperiod.9 I would also note that margin debt is now at record-high levels.10 In the event of a\nsell-off, high levels of margin debt can encourage additional selling, which could, in turn,\nlead to a more rapid tightening of financial conditions. Sufficient market trading liquidity\nis key to managing the resulting increased volume. I am cognizant that lower trading\nvolumes may be due, in part, to low levels of market volatility and may also be due to\nregulations such as the Volcker rule.\n\nIn the context of managing potential financial imbalances, I believe that we have been well served\nby strong macroprudential bank regulatory policies which have created tough capital requirements\nand regular stress testing for large systemically important institutions. These measures have helped\nguard against excessive debt buildup and creation of other imbalances which often accompany\nelevated levels of asset valuation.\nI strongly favor a prudent review of Dodd–Frank and the Volcker rule, as well as regulatory relief\nfor small- and mid-sized banks. However, I also believe that maintaining strong macroprudential\npolicies for big banks—particularly stringent capital requirements and rigorous annual stress\ntesting—is very important for managing potential financial imbalances at this stage in the\neconomic cycle.\n\n5\n\n\fImplications for the Stance of Monetary Policy\nIn assessing progress in reaching our dual mandate, I am increasingly cognizant of the risks\nposed by potential economic and financial imbalances. Such imbalances, if allowed to build,\nhave the potential to, at some point, threaten the sustainability of the expansion and the\nattainment of our dual-mandate objectives.\nThe FOMC’s stated strategy indicates that when objectives are in conflict—such as appears to be\nthe case today—we are committed to following a “balanced approach” to policy. This approach\ninvolves assessing “other” factors, such as the magnitude of deviations from our longer-run\ninflation goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum\nlevel, as well as the timing of expected return to mandated and/or sustainable levels. Put more\nplainly, even though we are not meeting our inflation objective, the size of the expected full\nemployment overshoot is growing and should be taken into account in assessing appropriate\nmonetary policy actions.\nRegarding inflation, I would reiterate that cyclical forces are building, which should increasingly\noffset the structural forces of technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization.\nI am also mindful that if we wait too long to see actual evidence of inflation, we may get behind\nthe curve and have to subsequently raise rates more rapidly. This type of rapid rate rise has the\npotential to increase the risk of recession.\nLastly, due to the structural headwinds of aging demographics and slowing workforce growth in\nthe U.S. as well as most developed economies, I believe that the neutral nominal rate of interest is\nlikely in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent—materially lower than we are historically accustomed.\nAs such, I think it is important that, to the extent possible, monetary policy accommodation be\nremoved in a gradual and patient manner. I would like to avoid a situation where the FOMC is\nplaying “catch-up” in raising interest rates.\nTaking all these factors into account, and from a risk management point of view, I believe it will\nlikely be appropriate, in the near future, to take the next step in the process of removing monetary\naccommodation. This should be done in the context of an overall strategy of removing\naccommodation in a gradual and patient manner. I believe this strategy will increase the likelihood\nof sustaining and extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\n\n6\n\n\fAppendix A\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers\nincreasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being\nsupplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing\ngoods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop\nfor goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing\nthe pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on\ncreating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by\neducational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college education, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent and the labor force participation rate is 73.7 percent. If\nyou have some college, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent and participation is 65.8 percent; a\nhigh school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.3 percent and participation is 56.9 percent; and\nsome high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.7 percent and participation rate is 46.1\npercent.\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they are retrained, these workers often see their productivity and incomes\ndecline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall\nlabor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—it requires structural reforms. The reforms could include improving early\nchildhood literacy and overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who\ngraduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.11 It would also\ninclude stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to\nimprove employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker\nproductivity. These initiatives could improve educational attainment levels in order to help our\ncitizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major\ncapital projects. It may also help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally\nover the last few years, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and lack of pricing\npower by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins.\n\n7\n\n\f1\n\nSee the statement at: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\nRefers to total participation rate for those age 16 and older; estimates are as of October 2017.

        "content": "Impact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion\nof Key Structural Drivers Affecting U.S.\nMonetary Policy\n\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nOctober 2017\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nPia Orrenius, Keith Phillips, Jason Saving, William Simmons, Mark Wynne, and Mine Yucel in preparing these remarks.\n\n\fImpact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion of Key\nStructural Drivers Affecting U.S. Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nAt the September 2017 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans\nto begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I\nstrongly support the decision to begin the process of reducing the balance sheet. I believe that the\ngradual and phased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important\nmarkets. In the September meeting, the committee also decided to leave the target federal funds\nrate in a range of 100 to 125 basis points but left open the possibility of gradual removals of\naccommodation (i.e., raises in the federal funds rate) in the future.\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding the economic\nimpact of Hurricane Harvey as well as economic conditions in the Eleventh District, U.S. and\nglobally. I will also discuss key structural drivers, such as aging demographics, high levels of\ngovernment debt to gross domestic product (GDP), globalization, and technology-enabled\ndisruption and their implications for U.S. monetary policy.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The\nEleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas\naccounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. GDP1 and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment.2 It is the\nlargest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to more than 50 Fortune 500 companies.3 The\ncharacteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and\nimmigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of Hurricane Harvey and its impact on the\nEleventh District as well as the U.S.\nImpact of Hurricane Harvey\nThe Eleventh District is working to recover from the effects of Hurricane Harvey. It is our basecase assumption that property damage from the storm is likely to be in the range of\napproximately $75-$100 billion. Most of this damage was due to flooding versus wind and other\nforms of hurricane damage. Of that amount, we estimate that approximately $45-$55 billion was\ndue to damage to residential property. In addition, approximately $16-$20 billion was due to\ncommercial property damage, approximately $10-$12 billion was due to vehicle damage and\nanother $6-$10 billion was due to infrastructure damage.4 Unfortunately, some substantial\npercentage of these losses will ultimately prove to be uninsured.\n\n2\n\n\fBefore the storm, the Dallas Fed estimated that multifamily rental housing in Houston had a\nrelatively high vacancy rate. Since the storm, because many displaced homeowners have elected\nto rent (if only temporarily), occupancy rates have risen substantially and the multifamily\noverhang appears to have been eliminated. Further, our contacts suggest that multifamily\ndeveloper/operators in Houston may accelerate their plans to build additional rental housing\ncapacity.\nWe expect some short-term job loss in the Gulf Coast region of Texas in the range of 55,000 to\n75,000 jobs. However, we believe that these losses will prove to be temporary.\nThe storm has also spurred substantial discussion of undocumented workers, in Houston\nspecifically and in Texas generally. It is estimated that approximately 575,000 undocumented\npeople live in the Greater Houston area.5 Our contacts estimate that a substantial percentage of\nconstruction workers in Houston are likely undocumented. In studying the aftermath of other\nsevere-weather events, we note that undocumented workers have historically been critical\nparticipants in the rebuilding and recovery effort.\nThere is significant concern about the potential failure rate of small businesses in Houston due to\nan extended period of business interruption and a significant amount of uninsured losses. In our\nDallas Fed September surveys, 58 percent of respondents who suffered Hurricane Harvey\ndamage reported physical capital losses that were uninsured, and 74 percent of hurricaneimpacted respondents reported lost revenue and/or production that was uninsured.6 We are\nmindful that banks will need to work with borrowers and make tough judgments regarding future\nbusiness viability in order to help the small business community weather this crisis.\nOf course, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity and offshore\nproduction facilities. The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns temporarily\nimpacted oil inventories and gasoline prices. Our estimate is that the refinery industry came\nsubstantially back online by late September. Offshore production has more recently been\nimpacted by Hurricane Nate, which caused substantially all Gulf of Mexico oil production\nfacilities as well as two refineries to temporarily halt operations. While the full impact of the\nmost recent storm has yet to be determined, Dallas Fed economists believe it will likely have\nonly modest and temporary effects on refinery and production operations.\nThe recent hurricanes have not changed our basic outlook regarding global supply and demand\nfor oil. We continue to believe that we are in a fragile equilibrium over the next few years. While\nthere is certainly a risk that oil prices could break to the downside, the Dallas Fed’s baseline\nview is that there will be continued price volatility but within a band between the mid-$40s to the\nmid-$50s for the remainder of 2017 and 2018. Prices moving to the lower end of that range will\ntend to reduce prospective drilling activity, and prices moving to the higher end of that range will\ntend to encourage greater drilling activity.\nOur energy industry contacts continue to indicate that the bulk of their capital spending plans are\nfocused on shale oil production and involve investment in technologies that will create greater\nproduction efficiencies. Our recent Dallas Fed Energy Surveys suggest that the rate of growth in\n3\n\n\fcapital spending on shale oil production has slowed materially relative to earlier in the year.\nSurvey participants also continue to report that, in a number of locations, current market prices\nare above break-even drilling levels, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced economic activity in the Eleventh District\nduring the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the fourth quarter will show a rebound in\neconomic activity that should more than offset the decline in the third quarter. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in\nthree years. Our business outlook surveys suggest continued strong growth in the state’s\nmanufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\nOur study of the aftermath of previous severe storms gives us confidence that, after a period of\nweakness, Texas economic activity will “catch up” and return to previous rates of trend growth.\nOur confidence in this recovery is bolstered by the continued migration (as well as immigration)\nof people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the Texas economy has, over time, become\nincreasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately\n22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.7 Based on these trends, and as the energy\nsector continues to stabilize and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth\nprospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\nThe U.S.\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017 and a\n3.1 percent rate in the second quarter. First-quarter GDP was negatively impacted by weak\nconsumer spending and a deceleration of net inventory investment. The strong second quarter\nwas primarily due to a rebound in consumer spending and a stabilization of inventory\ninvestment.\nOur Dallas Fed economists recently increased their forecast of U.S. GDP growth to\napproximately 2.4 percent in 2017. Embedded in this forecast is a likely drag on third-quarter\nGDP growth due to recent hurricanes. However, we expect a rebound in economic activity in the\nfourth quarter which should substantially offset hurricane-related impacts from the third quarter.\nThe key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a healthy U.S. consumer. The U.S.\nconsumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is\ntoday in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\nIn addition to a healthy consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 will continue to be\nbolstered by some improvement in nonresidential fixed investment and international trade. We\nexpect that this rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, should be sufficient\nto remove any remaining slack from the labor market.\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms could provide upside to this forecast.\nHowever, it is also the case that U.S. policy regarding trade and immigration bears watching and\ncould have some negative impact on future rates of growth.\n4\n\n\fUnemployment and the Impact of Demographic Trends\nThe September jobs report showed a decrease of 33,000 in payroll employment. Our Dallas Fed\neconomists believe that the September report was significantly negatively impacted by recent\nhurricanes, and it will likely take some time to separate “signal” from “noise” in this report.\nEven with the weak September data, the year-to-date average monthly pace of job gains in 2017\nhas been approximately 148,000. This compares to an average of approximately 171,000 through\nAugust 2017 and 187,000 in 2016. As we move toward full employment, I would continue to\nexpect the average rate of job growth to slow, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in\nthe economy.\nIn addition to the most recent headline unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, my economic team\nlooks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and\npeople working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as\nwell as the labor force participation rate.\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) stands at 8.3 percent, which is the lowest rate since June\n2007. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we have moved very close to full\nemployment in the U.S.\nUnemployment At or Near Prerecession Levels\nPercent*\n\n18\nU-6 unemployment rate\n16\n\nHeadline unemployment rate\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\nSep-17\n8.3\n\n8\n\n6\n4.2\n\n4\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n*Seasonally adjusted.\nNOTES: U-6 is the total unemployed, plus marginally attached workers and total employed part time for economic reasons.

This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This\naging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline to below 61 percent.8\nThe likely net impact of this aging trend will be to reduce the rate of labor force growth in the\nUnited States. You can see from the chart below that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth\namong those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due\nto a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age cohort as well\nas a plateauing of the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect these trends to continue as we enter the next decade.\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker\nexpected workforce growth trends will likely negatively affect potential GDP growth in the years\nahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\n\nDeclining Rates of Labor Force and Population Growth\nPercent change, annualized\n\n3.0\n2.71\n2.5\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n2.05\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\nPopulation, 20-64 years old\n\n1.95\n\n1.37\n\n1.27\n1.16\n\n1.0\n\n1.11\n0.84\n\n0.36e\n\n0.5\n\n0.51e\n0.26e\n\n0.0\n1970s\n\n1980s\n\n1990s\n\n2000s\n\n2010s\n\n2020s\n\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics through September 2017 for labor force growth data; Census Bureau for historical and estimated population growth\ndata from 1970s through 2020s.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for\neconomic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as\nunemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for\n6\n\n\fprime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 83 percent for those\nwho have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 77 percent for\nthose with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school\ndiploma.9\nWhile the labor participation rate is disappointing for those with lower levels of educational\nattainment, our Dallas Fed economists also note that there is a substantial skills gap in the U.S.\nThat is, there are more job openings than workers for various types of middle-skills positions.\nThe National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of September 2017, nearly half\nof small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job\nopenings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses,\nconstruction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial\ntechnicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers\nand insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more\nslowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\nWhile a college education is highly correlated with better employment outcomes, it is also the\ncase that the substantial skills gap highlights the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up\npublic/private partnerships that focus on middle-skills training. This training is critical to help\nworkers, who may not have attended college, attain the capabilities needed to find attractive\nemployment in the 21st century economy.\nOne other significant educational concern is the lagging levels of early-childhood literacy among\nfast-growing demographic groups in the U.S. Studies suggest that, if a child begins first grade\nwith reading capability behind grade level, they typically fail to catch up during their educational\ncareer.10 This has significant implications for their ultimate level of educational attainment. As a\nresult of this trend, the Dallas Fed has consistently highlighted the need, nationally and locally,\nto invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of\neducational attainment among our younger population.\nEducation initiatives are an investment in our future. They are likely to help in the effort to\nreduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and more inclusive\nprosperity.\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past\nseveral years. I believe this has likely been due to past strengthening of the dollar and weaker\nenergy prices as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and\ntechnology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\nTwelve-month measures of both headline and core inflation have weakened since February 2017.\nWhile I believe that this recent weakening may well be transitory, I will continue to be patient\nand open-minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n7\n\n\fIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track\nseveral measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most\nextreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe,\nrepresents a more reliable indicator of trend inflation. After running at approximately 1.6 percent\nin 2015, Trimmed Mean PCE inflation gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.9 percent during 2016.\nThrough August 2017, this measure has fallen back to 1.6 percent on a 12-month basis.\nI am of the view that, despite recent weakness, as slack continues to be removed from the labor\nmarket, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. However, I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to\nconfirm that recent weakness is indeed transitory and that we are continuing to make progress in\nreaching our inflation objective.\nTrimmed Mean Inflation Captures Headline Inflation’s Medium-Term Trend\nPercent change, year/year\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\nAug-17\n1.62\n1.5\n\n1.43\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\nHeadline PCE\nTrimmed Mean PCE\n\n0.0\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNOTE: The dashed line represents the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation target.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nNon-U.S.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic\ndevelopments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic\ngrowth domestically. Over the past year, we have seen a broad-based improvement in global\neconomic activity. Brazil and Russia appear to be emerging from recession; Japan and the euro\narea are now growing more robustly.\n8\n\n\fThe United Kingdom is still growing but at a much-reduced rate. The British government is\nworking toward articulating a coherent vision for its post-Brexit arrangements with the European\nUnion. Dallas Fed economists continue to believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be\nmanageable for the U.S.\nDallas Fed economists continue to carefully monitor emerging-market countries, particularly\nChina. As discussed in previous essays, China is challenged by a high degree of overcapacity\n(particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also\nin the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to\none that is based on consumer spending and services. As this transition unfolds, the world is\nlikely going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime,\nChina is working to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first\nquarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and\nlead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic\ngrowth in the U.S.\nBroader Secular Trends\nAs I have discussed in almost all my recent essays and speeches, my economic research team\ncarefully considers and works to understand cyclical forces in the economy as well as several\nkey secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past two years, these drivers are likely having\na powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\n\nAging-workforce demographics in the U.S. and across major economies. As discussed\nearlier, aging-population trends, on balance, reduce labor force participation rates and\nultimately create headwinds for potential GDP growth. These demographic trends are\nalso likely to impact the “dependency ratio”11—that is, they are likely to exacerbate a\nsituation in which an increasing share of the population is depending on those of working\nage to pay for future medical and retirement benefits. These trends are likely to create\nfurther strains on the ability of the U.S. government to manage its fiscal obligations\n(discussed further below).\n\n\n\nLimits to the sustainability of the so-called global debt super cycle. Historically, the U.S.\nand other countries have used increasing public debt—often through tax cuts and higher\ngovernment spending—to boost economic growth. In some countries, such as China,\nlarge quantities of private sector debt have also been used to fuel growth. At this point,\nthere are likely limits to the ability of countries, including the U.S., to further increase\ndebt to GDP in order to bolster economic growth. As I discussed earlier in this essay, we\nhave seen a deleveraging of the U.S. household sector since 2008. As a result, the\nhousehold sector is in much better shape today. However, while household balance sheets\nhave improved since the Great Recession, government debt held by the public stands at\n9\n\n\fthe highest levels since the World War II era12—approximately 75 percent of GDP (see\nchart below)—and the present value of future unfunded entitlements is now estimated at\n$49 trillion.13 These obligations will increasingly work their way into U.S. budget deficits\nover the next five to 10 years—raising questions regarding fiscal sustainability which, if\nnot addressed, could negatively impact longer-run economic growth.\n\nGovernment Debt Levels Have Climbed Significantly\nPercent\n\n80\n\nQ2:2017\n75\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\nFederal debt held by the\npublic as a percent of\nGDP\n\n10\n\n0\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\nNOTES: Debt held by the public excludes intragovernmental holdings. The shaded bars indicate NBER recessions.\nSOURCES: U.S. Treasury; Bureau of Economic Analysis; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\n\n\nGlobalization. Economies, financial markets and companies are more closely intertwined\nthan ever before. For example, regarding trade, estimates indicate that in excess of 40\npercent of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is of U.S. origin.14 Furthermore,\nDallas Fed economists estimate that as much as 70 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico\nare “intermediate goods.”15 This is because much of the U.S. trade with Mexico is related\nto integrated production chains and logistical arrangements between U.S. and Mexican\ncompanies. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that these arrangements have helped improve\ncompetitiveness and create jobs in the U.S. Without these arrangements, these jobs might\nhave otherwise been lost to other areas of the world, particularly Asia.\nWhile trade and globalization have yielded net economic benefits for the U.S. economy,\nthey have also created severe local hardships that the U.S. and other advanced economies\nhave struggled to address. The challenge is how to reap the benefits of globalization\nwhile addressing the disruptions it creates—failing to address these disruptions is likely\n10\n\n\fto reduce public support for global trade, which could have negative implications for the\npace of economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n\n\nTechnology-enabled disruption. In order to improve their competiveness, many\ncompanies are actively investing in technology, which is leading to a significant\nreduction in the number of workers needed to produce goods and services. The result is\nthat U.S. workers across a range of industries are finding that their jobs are being\nrestructured or eliminated. While this trend has increased productivity in most industries,\nI believe one key reason that overall labor productivity growth has been sluggish is that\ndisplaced workers are often going to less-productive jobs. This issue is a key reason I\nhave been emphasizing the need for beefed-up skills training to help displaced workers\nget retrained so they can find more-productive employment. It is also why the Dallas Fed\nhas been working on highlighting the need for early-childhood literacy and other\ninitiatives which could improve educational-attainment levels in order to help our citizens\nbetter thrive in a world which increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nMany industries are also facing a disruptive technology-enabled competitor that is\nthreatening their business model by offering lower cost and greater convenience in the\nsale of goods or services. Think the digital camera versus the old film industry, Amazon\nversus retail stores, Khan Academy versus brick-and-mortar schools, 3-D printing versus\ntraditional manufacturing, Uber and Lyft versus taxis, and so on. This technologyenabled disruption has allowed consumers to achieve better value and more easily\ncomparison shop for merchandise and services. It has also reduced the pricing power of\nmany companies and caused them to intensify their focus on creating greater operational\nefficiencies.\nI believe that the dislocations resulting from technology-enabled disruption are\nsometimes confused with the impacts of globalization. That is, a substantial number of\njob losses may have more to do with technology-enabled disruption even though they\nmay be attributed to globalization.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive\ncompetitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well\nas investing in major capital projects. In my view, it may also help explain the record\nlevel of merger activity globally, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and\nlack of pricing power by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or\nimprove profit margins.\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I\nhave been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy\nto join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the\nkey structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower\nrates of productivity growth as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates\n11\n\n\fof technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a\nsubstitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper fundamental\nchallenges.\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether\nthey help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is\ncomprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the\ncontext of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nI believe that we are making good progress in reaching our full-employment objective. The U.S.\nconsumer is healthy, and business activity continues to strengthen. Global growth has been\nstronger than expected in 2017. While our estimate of 2.4 percent U.S. GDP growth in 2017 is\nsluggish by historical standards, it should be sufficient to continue to remove slack from the\nlabor market.\nNormally, at this stage in the recovery and with a tightening labor market, we would expect to\nsee increasing evidence of inflation pressures. I believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are\nbuilding as we remove slack from the labor market and approach full employment. However, I\nalso believe that these cyclical forces are being at least partially offset by secular forces\n(described earlier in this essay), particularly an intensifying rate of technology-enabled\ndisruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization. These secular forces are likely limiting the\npricing power of businesses and muting inflationary pressures.\nFrom a risk-management point of view, I am mindful that if we wait too long to see signs of\ngreater inflation, we may get “behind the curve” and have to play catch up by increasing rates\nmore rapidly. Historically, this has increased the likelihood of recession.\nI am also mindful that there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to\nsavers as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business\ndecisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless—it carries risks. It has been my\nexperience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very\npainful to address.\nHowever, I believe that structural forces, particularly slowing workforce growth due to an aging\npopulation, will continue to pose challenges for future economic growth. As a result, my view is\nthat the neutral rate, the interest rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is\nlikely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed. Therefore, I have argued that future\nremovals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner.\nBased on these considerations, I intend to keep an open mind about removing accommodation in\nupcoming FOMC meetings. In the months ahead, I will continue to assess the economy’s\n12\n\n\fprogress in removing labor slack, and I will be looking for evidence that building cyclical forces\nhave the prospect of offsetting structural headwinds, such that we can expect to make progress\ntoward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term. Given the strength of the\nU.S. economy, I think it is likely we will see greater evidence of this progress and, as a\nconsequence, it will be appropriate to continue the process of gradually removing monetary\naccommodation.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis, first quarter 2017.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Bureau of Labor Statistics, second quarter 2017.\n3\nSee the 2017 Fortune 500 list of companies headquartered in Texas,\nhttp://fortune.com/fortune500/list/filtered?statename=Texas.\n4\n“Hurricane Irma Losses $58–$83 Billion: Moody’s Analytics,” Artemis, Sept. 13, 2017,\nwww.artemis.bm/blog/2017/09/13/hurricane-irma-economic-losses-58-83-billion-moodys-analytics/.\n5\n“Twenty Metro Areas Are Home to Six-in-Ten Unauthorized Immigrants in the U.S.,” by Jeffrey S.\nPassel and D’Vera Cohn, FactTank, Pew Research Center, Feb. 9, 2017, www.pewresearch.org/facttank/2017/02/09/us-metro-areas-unauthorized-immigrants/.\n6\nTexas Business Outlook Surveys special questions, Sept. 25, 2017.\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tssos/2017/1709/specquest.aspx.\n7\nCensus Bureau.\n8\n“Labor Force Projections to 2024: The Labor Force Is Growing, but Slowly,” Monthly Labor Review,\nBureau of Labor Statistics, December 2015, www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/labor-force-projectionsto-2024.htm.\n9\nCensus Bureau, Current Population Survey 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement,\nwww.census.gov/cps/data/cpstablecreator.html.\n10\nSee “Catch Them Before They Fall: Identification and Assessment to Prevent Reading Failure in\nYoung Children,” by Joseph K.

        "content": "Globalization vs. Technology-Enabled Disruption\nRobert Kaplan\nSeptember 25, 2017\nA number of the pressures that workers air feeling in this country, I think, are being attributed to\nglobalization, meaning people think that maybe immigrants are the cause of job losses. Or they believe\nthat trade is the cause of job losses in many cities and certain industries. And I think both those impacts\nmay have been true to some extent several years ago. I think today, though, is often not always, but\noften far more likely that job losses being experienced by workers and in certain industries is much\nmore due to technology enable disruption than it is to globalization. Even though the narratives\nsometimes it's being attributed to globalization, I think it has more to do with disruption. I think there\nhave been millions of jobs that have been either redesigned or lost or changed or whole industries. For\nexample. The film industry is a good example. The camera industry that's been dramatically changed\nbecause of technology enabled disruption and the reason I like to step back and site. The difference\nbetween these two causes is if we misdiagnose why things were happening. I if we mistakenly attribute\nsome of these job losses to globalization, we may actually make decisions from a policy point of view\nthat could make us even less competitive, create more job losses on bake poor policy decisions.\n\n\f"

        "content": "What Is Technology-Enabled Disruption?\nRobert Kaplan\nSeptember 25, 2017\nTechnology enabled disruption means to me: Business models are being altered by the use of\ntechnology. Technology is being used to find either lower price, create lower price, greater convenience\nor other features that are changing the nature of competition. So let me talk about some of the impacts\nof disruption that that I think we're seeing at the Dallas Fed on at the Federal Reserve. First impact, I\nthink, is on inflation in that there's a cyclical element of inflation, and I think there's a structural element\nof inflation. The cyclical element of inflation is, is the labor market tightens and slack comes out of the\nlabor market. We would normally see some wage pressure, greater wage pressure and eventually with a\nlag that would be passed on to price pressures. We're not seeing that, uh, in the same way we have in\nthe past at this level of unemployment, and I think part of the reason is structural in that technology\nenabled disruption means workers are increasingly being replaced by technology, which I think may may\nbe having some impact on wages. In addition, businesses have much less pricing power because\nconsumers can so easily shop for the lowest price on DSO. The impact of that is businesses are more\nlikely having to resort to cost savings, further replacing workers with technology in order to be\ncompetitive because they know they are unlikely to be able to price to pass on price increases to the\nconsumers to their customers. And so I think this is likely having some muted impact on inflation.\n\n\f"
