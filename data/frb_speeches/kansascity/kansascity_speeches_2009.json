Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMid-America Payments Conference 2009\nKansas City, Missouri\nOctober 29,2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fIntroduction\nI am pleased to have an opportunity to join you today at the conclusion of this year's\n\nMid-America Payments Conference. We have had a long association with the Kansas City\nClearinghouse, MPX and now EPCOR, as we share a focus on improving our nation’s payments\nsystem and ensuring its benefits accrue to financial institutions and their customers here in the\n\nheartland.\n\nAs I begin my remarks today, I want to emphasize that I am expressing my own views,\nand they are not those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you know, our payments system is going through one of the most radical\ntransformations since the advent of the ACH network more than four decades ago. The result is\nnot only a payments system that is much more complex in its operation, but also in the\n\nchallenges that it faces and the risks to its integrity.\nIn response to this evolution, central banks around the world are thinking about how they\n\ncan continue to maintain an efficient, safe, and accessible payments system, hi the United States,\none key question going forward is what role the Federal Reserve can and should play in this new\n\nenvironment. While some in the industry and government advocate a reduced presence, I believe\n\nthere is a strong case for the Federal Reserve Banks to continue active involvement.\n\nChanges Prompting Rethinking of the Fed’s Role\n\nSince their founding almost a century ago, the Federal Reserve Banks have played a role\nin the nation’s payments system. Charged with ensuring its efficiency, safety and accessibility to\nthe public, this mission remains as important as ever.\n\n2\n\n\fThe payments system today is very different than the one that was hi place in the early\n\n1900s. But more striking is how far removed it is from what we saw only a few years ago.\n\nConsumers have embraced debit and credit cards as the preferred form for payments. Paper\nchecks, when written, are converted to electronic form and cleared via ACH or Check 21\nnetworks. Today, paper checks represent only 2 percent of the total deposited with Federal\nReserve Banks. By the end of the year, the Federal Reserve will have closed all but one of its\n\npaper check handling sites. The Federal Reserve helped drive this move to electronics and the\n\npublic benefits are clear. For example, the aggregate fees paid by financial institutions to the\n\nFederal Reserve Banks for check collection will have declined from about $700 million in 2005\nto less than half that amount by next year.\n\nWhile check clearing volume has been declining for a decade, ACH transaction growth\nbegan to flatten about a year ago. Whether that represents the temporary effects of the recession\nor is the result of a structural change, the past rapid growth rates that we have seen in our ACH\ntransactions are unlikely to continue at such a pace.\n\nMeanwhile, debit card transactions have continued to increase, even during the recession.\n\nWe have also seen the growing presence and influence of nonbank providers of payments\n\nservices. For example, firms like PayPal and Amazon are introducing the capability for software\ndevelopers to apply their front-end payment solution to make online purchases for specific\nmerchants wanting to control the buying experience. Mobile access to the Internet is projected to\nexpatrd rapidly with implications for the positioning of financial institutions, telecom networks,\n\nand technology firms in the payments chain.\n\nAs we step back and take a broad look at these developments hr retail payments, it is\nperhaps striking how much of the growth is taking place in the private sector with little\n\n3\n\n\fregulatory oversight. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have not played as active a\nrole in the operation or oversight of card networks, the fastest growing portion of retail\npayments. Many nonbank providers of payments products and services have little, if any,\n\noversight of their operations. If this continues, it will create a significant vulnerability for our\npayments system.\n\nFor many in the industry, the success and profitability of payments providers is a\ntestament to the superiority of market solutions outside the Federal Reserve or regulatory\nenvironment. “Why mess with success?” I am asked. While in the short term this may seem\n\nobvious, I want to remind you that this was also said about subprime lending, complex financial\nproducts and commercial real estate guidelines only a few years ago. It is the nature of highly\n\nprofitable private providers to oppose regulation and increased competition. However, in today’s\nenvironment, and based on recent experience, it seems clear that the central bank will be held\n\naccountable for the safety and accessibility of a reliable payments system. If consumers are\novercharged or disadvantaged, or if the system comes crashing down everyone will ask. “Where\n\nwas the centr al bank? Why didn’t it protect the public and the financial system?”\nSo yes, candidly, I do question whether the private sector alone can provide a safe,\ncompetitive and efficient payments system over the long term.\n\nEconomic Rationale for a Government Role in Retail Payments\nIn general, most economists believe that markets work well in most circumstances. The\nexceptions arise when there are externalities or other forms of market failure. Examples are when\nthere are interdependencies among market participants that lead to important spillover effects or\n\n4\n\n\fwhen scale economies lead to the emergence of a small number of industry providers with\n\npotential market power.\nMany payments markets have a number of these features, and I would like to highlight\n\nthree that seem especially important in assessing the need for central bank involvement in retail\npayments. First, payments markets are networks, and economic studies of networks suggest\n\nthere can be severe coordmation problems that may inhibit their growth and development. These\n\ninvolve difficulties in creating standards and in undertaking large startup capital expenditures.\nSecond, because of externalities and spillover effects, networks may under invest in\n\nsecurity as individual participants look fust to their own profitability and do not consider system\nintegrity as a whole. We are all well aware of the recent rise in major information breaches and\nidentity theft in the retail payments system. I would note that many of these instances have been\n\ncentered at nonbank payments providers.\n\nThird, because of scale economies, payments systems and electro me payments systems in\nparticular, tend to have a small number of providers, raising concerns about market power and\nnoncompetitive pricing. In the United States, we have seen a trend toward increased\n\nconcentration in debit card networks, with a decline from 43 debit networks in 1995 to 13 in\n\n2007. Indeed in 2007, the top three debit card networks (PIN and signature) handled 8 8 percent\n\nof total transactions and Visa alone had a market share of almost 64 percent. As consolidation\nhas occurred, we have seen significant increases in interchange fees, a development that has not\ngone unnoticed by the public and government officials around the world.\nIn light of these issues, I think a strong case can be made for continued central bank\n\ninvolvement in retail payments. The key questions at hand focus on the nature of central bank\n\n5\n\n\factivities and, especially, how these activities should evolve to meet the changing structure of the\n\nretail payments industry.\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s involvement in retail payments has centered on\n\novercoming coordination problems that have inhibited efficiency. In this regard, I believe the\nFederal Reseive's position as an operator has allowed it to be an effective catalyst and facilitator\nfor payments modernization.\n\nFor example, in the early 1970s, as bankers, regional payments associations, and the U.S.\nTreasury struggled with the increasing volume of check payments and related costs, the Federal\nReserve collaborated with the industry to build the automated processing systems and\n\ndistribution network that would become the ACH. And, in 1984, the Federal Reserve provided\nthe impetus for industry adoption of another major innovation by applying digital image capture\ntechnology to the backroom of the check processing business, again in response to a need from\n\nthe U.S. Treasury to reduce the costs of microfilming checks it issued. As you know, this\n\ninvestment was later leveraged to establish check image exchange networks.\nIn each of these endeavors and others, we have worked closely with the industry and\nCongress to develop legislation, standards, technology and procedures to overcome the severe\n\ncoordination difficulties that prevented the private sector from moving ahead on its own. Even\ntoday, we continue to leverage our operational role in ACH. For example, we’re working with\nindustry stakeholders to address problems such as how to more efficiently and safely exchange\npayments internationally with low volumes now, but growing volumes in the future. And we are\nworking to introduce faster ACH clearing with a same day settlement capability, which we\n\nexpect to roll out in the first half of next year.\n\n6\n\n\fFinally, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize that hi times of crisis, the Federal\nReserve’s operator role has served to minimize the impact to public confidence that would occur\nwith major disruptions to the retail payments system. In the hours and days following the Sept.\n\n11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks were in a position to keep the check collection\nsystem operating despite the disruption to air transportation. While the probability of disruptions\n\nis low, crises will happen sometime in the future and I believe the Federal Reserve’s operator\nrole enhances the resiliency of our retail payments system.\nIn the future, the Fed's traditional role of catalyst and facilitator may be less needed\n\noutside of ACH. After all, card networks have developed and prospered without Federal Reserve\ninvolvement, and the innovation introduced by nonbank payments providers has been\n\nimpressive.\n\nThoughts on the Federal Reserve Banks' Future Role in Retail Payments\nIn my view, a starting point for considering the Federal Reserve's future role is to\nconsider whether the safety and efficiency of retail payments will be enhanced by the central\n\nbank’s continuing presence.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, it is not clear to me that the private sector will make sufficient\ninvestments to maintain the safety and integrity of retail payments without some sort of Federal\nReserve or government pressure. Consequently, I believe it is important to ask whether the\n\nFederal Reserve, as a traditional, trusted provider of secure payments services, can play a role in\n\nhelping to enhance the security of the retail payments system and reducing identity theft. More\nbroadly, I think it is important to consider the extent to which nonbank providers of payments\n\n7\n\n\fservices pose systemic risks to the retail payments system and to explore how they, along with\ntraditional providers, might be more effectively monitored by regulatory oversight programs.\nI also think that the Federal Reserve could play a role in enhancing the competitive\n\nefficiency of the retail payments system by leveraging its operational role in ACH to provide a\n\nplatform for clearing all forms of debit transactions. Note that I am not suggesting the Fed issue\ndebit or credit cards, but rather, that the Federal Reserve provide a cost effective alternative to\nmoving and clearing debit transactions, and as a systemic backup to the private sector - a role it\n\nhas played in payments since nearly its founding. Such an approach may require additional\ninvestments in and enhancements to the FedACH network. Some may disagree, but looking\nback, the Federal Reserve’s role in check payments did not drive competition out, but assured\n\nbroad, safe access in a more competitive environment, to the payments system.\nAs I have floated this idea over the past year, I have received feedback from some who\ndisagree. However, we need to think about the effects of the likely alternatives. As I indicated\nearlier, concern about noncompetitive pricing of payments services and market power have\n\nemerged around the world. This has led to significant government interventions in market pricing\nand market practices hi a growing number of countries. The course taken in many of these\ncountries has been to subject the card networks and market participants to greater oversight and,\n\nin some cases, to direct government involvement in interchange pricing. As you know, similar\n\nbills are pending in Congress.\nMy own view, like that of many economists, is that government involvement in direct\n\nprice setting in any industry is fraught with problems in implementation, generally leading to\n\npoor outcomes and unintended consequences. At the same time, noncompetitive market\n\nstructures and pricing, if present, do need to be addressed. One alternative, of course is greater\n\n8\n\n\fantitrust enforcement. My suggestion is somewhat different, to increase competition via the\n\nFederal Reserve’s role in retail payments, specifically as an operator of the ACH network. Of\n\ncourse there may be other means of making noncompetitive markets more contestable, which\nalso should be considered.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, the retail payments system is evolving rapidly and is more complex than\n\never. It saves as a critical component to the infrastructure of the economy. The Federal Resave,\nworking closely with financial institutions and the industry as a partner and competitor has been\n\nan important driver of efficiencies and current levels of safety and stability. However, the growth\nin payments transactions is now occurring in card networks, and nonbanks’ presence is growing.\n\nSome may call for the Fed to exit retail payments now that physical distribution is no longer\nneeded and its share of retail payments transactions is naturally declining. However,\n\nconcentration in card markets, increased concerns about security and reliability, the unintended\n\nconsequences of regulation versus Fed participation hi these markets, and the success of the Fed\nin sparking industry innovation from its position on the ground, lead me to conclude that Fed’s\npresence as an operator is needed now more than ever.\n\n9\n\n\f"

        "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy:\nWe Can Do Better\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nDenver, Colorado\nOctober 6, 2009\n\n\fI want to thank you for attending this evening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver\n\nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congr ess created the Federal Reserve\nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the nation’s central bank could not be an institution\nisolated inside Washington. Instead, they recognized the importance of distributing the Federal\n\nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regional Federal Reserve Banks that\nserve specific regions of the country. The regional Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here\nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors play a key role in connecting the\n\nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations directly to the communities we serve. We have two\nDenver-area directors on the Kansas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board\n\nincludes four Denver-area directors. I would like to recognize how important these Coloradans\nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central\n\nbank.\n\nCHALLENGES\nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost\n\nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts\nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and\nwe are starting to see improvement in business and manufacturing. Additionally, yield spreads\nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are nanowing. They are not at\n\nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indication that investors are more willing to provide\ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount of stimulus has been put in place to spark\nthis recovery, and I believe it will prevent a double-dip recession.\n\nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other\n\ncentral banks around the world will have to unwind the extensive policy accommodation used to\nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a delicate process because removing too soon could\n\nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The\n\nprocess will be particularly delicate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered\nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty around the condition of some of the largest\n\nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to monetary policy is to act in such a manner that you\nencourage the recovery while not fostering conditions for a future crisis, albeit one of a different\n\nnature.\n2\n\n\fAs policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds\n\nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvious to me is that a rate of 1\nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy - it is still very accommodative. As we consider our\n\nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy hr the current environment, but my\n\nexperience tells rue that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather\nthan later. Even if we were to start immediately, much time would pass before incremental\n\nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy.\nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long­\n\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from this crisis. In that regard, I tliink the best use\n\nof rny time here this evening will be to explain why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the\n\narea of regulatory reform, which is cunently under consideration in Congress. Looking at some\nof the policy issues that have emer ged hi recent weeks, it seems the public debate continues to\ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of tins crisis. We must address the issue of too\n\nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know\n\nwe can do better.\n\nREGULATORY REFORM\nToo Big to Fail\n\nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sur e\nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that a financial crisis will occur again at some\n\ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important exercise that we should undertake now is to\n\nensure that problems at large financial institutions are not allowed to jeopardize the basic\nsurvival of our financial system and economy.\n\nHow do we do that? How do we prevent incentive compensation schemes that cany high\ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by\n\nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-regulated? While the Administration has taken an\n\nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our- financial system, it is focusing first on\nsymptoms rather than the disease.\n\nAdam Smith is often thought of as the English-speaking world’s father of modern\neconomics. He is widely known for his book titled, The Wealth of Nations, in which he provided\n\n3\n\n\fhis analogy that a market economy was like an invisible hand guiding resources to their best use.\nLess well-known is another passage in that book in which he warns that:\n“The interest of the dealers ... is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to. that of the\n\npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market\nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be\n\nagainst it. and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising then profits above what they naturally would be. to\nlevy ... an absurd tax upon ... their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which\n\ncomes from tills order ought always to be listened to with great precaution.... It comes from an order of men whose\n\ninterest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to\noppress the public, and who ... upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.”\n\nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talking about, I would point out that in 1999 the\n\nCongress passed a piece of legislation, heavily endorsed by our largest banking firms, called the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This legislation ended the separation of commercial and investment\n\nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for the accelerated growth of large financial films\n\nin the United States, turning them into institutions that were thought to be “too big to fail.”\n\nTills should not be dismissed as a populist view of these institutions, but one that is\nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examining the advantages that accrued to these firms\n\nwith respect to then- capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail,\ntolerated an ever-expanding leverage ratio, relative to owner equity. For example, if you look at\n\nthe 20 largest institutions, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was\n\nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at the next smaller group of institutions, their equity-to-assets ratio\n\nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must cany lower leverage ratio because\nall those in the market - management, shareholders and creditors - know they will lose their jobs\n\nand investments if they make decisions that cause their banks to fail. This type of market\n\ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners and creditors of the larger films.\nIf you were to place these largest institutions under the same leverage constraints as the\nsmaller firms - at least 6.5 percent equity to asset - these larger firms would need to raise more\nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. Tins capital\n\ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to\nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Since the change in law, the largest 20 films\nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an\n4\n\n\fastonishing 70 percent. Even more striking perhaps is the fact that some of these firms are now\n\n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when this crisis began, and as yon know, many of these\nfirms were protected during the crisis.\nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest firms were at risk of failure, Congress passed\nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broad economy, but it also had the\nadditional effect of institutionalizing too big to fail in the United States.\n\nCompensation\nOne of the ironies of this action is that the management of these firms, even those\nneeding TARP funds to survive, continues to receive enormous compensation packages. As a\n\nresult, one of the issues currently distracting Congress and the public is executive compensation.\nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid individuals atop large firms that\n\ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comprehensive plan for resolving these firms and\ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, would address compensation\n\nissues far more effectively because it would leave these individuals out of work and wipe out any\nownership stake they hold. That does much more for accountability than simply capping an\n\nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented as you may know some firms have already begun to work around compensation limits by raising\n\nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.\n\nCompensation restrictions also call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of\nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the\n\ncosts of the bad decisions and risks they take, we also need to let them reap the rewards of the\ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of market distortions might be created by injecting a\n\ndegree of disconnect between compensation and performance - the same kind of disconnect that\n\nsome might suggest fosters the type of carelessness we saw in this crisis.\nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to\n\npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performance. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no\nway to earn enough money on trading to generate a $100 million bonus without taking open\n\npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in\nour nations’ payments system. If the trader wins, the company makes money. If the trader loses,\ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. Ure real\n5\n\n\fproblem with this scenario is that the company is too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay\n\nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it's their money, or the money of their shareholders or\n\ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If if s the money of U.S.\ntaxpayers, then if s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures\n\nthat they gamble with their own money.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge that policing such an executive compensation policy\nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely\nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly\n\ninterpreting that the government would bail out failed institutions and that the stock prices would\nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a one-way bet. It's not capitalism; it is bad policy.\n\nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is the first step in addressing compensation\nissues.\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed\nConsumer Financial Protection Agency. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We\ndo a lot of work throughout our District on consumer education and consumer issues. Our Bank\n\nalso hosts a nationwide call center on behalf of the entire Federal Reserve System. Consumers\n\ncan contact us by phone1 - and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine - or online at\nwww.FederalReserveConsunierHelp.eov to discuss problems related to any financial institution,\n\nregardless of the regulatory agency involved. These calls are extremely illuminating in what they\n\ntell us about the relationship between consumers and financial institutions. First of all, we handle\nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of concern and often confusion\nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are\ntargeted on the largest banks and most often related to credit card issues. Very few complaints\nare made against community banks. And, after these complaints have been investigated, few\n\nagainst conununity banks are actually found to involve violations of the consumer protection\nrales. This suggests that clarification or simplification of consumer protection rales may be\n\nnecessary for consumers to better understand what dieir protections are under the law.\n\n1 888-851-1920\n\n6\n\n\fI think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical\n\nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or gaps in the enforcement of these laws was not\nthe only factor, or even the driving factor, behind the run-up of subprime lending and the\nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experienced was a distortion of incentives in financial\n\nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyrocketing demand for mortgage backed securities and\na resulting deterioration in underwriting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate\nmore Ioans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable\n\nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market\ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in\nsecuritizing loans, the ability of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and\n\nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. There are also lessons to be learned about the\n\nscope and effectiveness of consumer protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators\nenforcing these laws.\nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of\n\nCongress to decide. My experience tells me, however, that comprehensive oversight of banks is\n\nimportant for both effective and efficient supervision. Under the coordinated approach we\ncurrently utilize, our goal is to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through\nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific\n\nconsumer protection rules. Separating those functions will create inefficiencies in information\n\ncollection and analysis, and add an additional layer of communication and coordination.\nBut in any case, the fact remains that the consumer and the public more generally will be\n\nbest served if we address the root cause of the abuse that many unfortunate consumers have\nsuffered during the crisis. We must change the incentives and enhance the accountability of the\ninstitutions that generated the complex products that served the principle goal of generating fees\n\nrather than being sound Ioan products.\n\nSolution\n\nMany times in the last year I have expressed my astonishment that Congress was able to\napprove $700 billion in TARP fluids in approximately one week and yet 18 months have passed\n\nsince Bear Steams was acquired by JPMorgan and there is still no resolution authority for the\nlargest financial firms.\n7\n\n\fFailure resolution for these largest firms and other yet-to-be-defined systemically\n\nimportant films is part of the proposed reform package now before Congress. Unfortunately, the\nproposal does not adequately address the too-big-to-fail problem in that it still provides too much\n\nlatitude to rescue failing firms. It confirms the practice of addressing failure of the largest firms\nin an ad hoc manner with individuals rather than the rule of law deciding which firms get rescued\n\nand which do not. As eager as we might be to address the shortcomings of our financial system,\n\nwe must also be carefill to get it right.\nWithout mandatory resolution authority directed under “the rule of law” for the largest\nfilms, financial reform will be incomplete and ineffective. Management will remain able to game\n\nthe compensation programs that we define, and consumers will be subject to higher fees and\n\nunfair treatment, even under a new regulator, should it come to be. There can be no confidence in\nthe system until there is a sense of fairness in the treatment of institutions whereby management\n\nand investors are held accountable for their decisions regardless of their film's size. We all know\nthe names of these firms. They were central to this crisis as it expanded and became a global\n\nrecession. However, while the crisis caused workers to lose their jobs and families to forfeit their\nhomes, the stockholders and creditors of these films enjoyed special protection funded by the\n\nAmerican taxpayer.\nTo begin with, the legislation needs to establish a mandatory, non negotiable resolution\n\nprocess for too-big-to-fail firms that are no longer viable as a going concern due to insufficient\ncapital or liquidity. With appropriate legislation, failing films could still avoid liquidation or a\n\ndrawn-out bankruptcy process. Instead, they would be put into receivership or conservatorship so\nas to provide an orderly process for maintaining essential services and avoiding systemic\n\ninstability while making management, shareholders and creditors accountable for their decisions.\n\nThe resolution process would apply to every financial institution whose problems might threaten\n\nfinancial or economic stability and is involved in the “plumbing” of the financial system - that\nis, those involved in the payments system and the provision of liquidity within the financial\n\nsystem.\n\nA resolution process where creditors bear losses commensurate with their investment\ndecisions would be significantly less costly to the taxpayer than the price we are currently paying\n\nin lost jobs, lost economic growth and actual outlays of public funds. Alternatively, if we do not\n\nfind a way to end too-big-to-fail, the largest institutions retain an inequitable competitive\n8\n\n\fadvantage, will continue to escape market discipline and are incented to engage in practices that\nultimately harm the financial system.\n\nA sound resolution process would provide greater assurance of equitable treatment for all\nparties, which is essential in a democratic, capitalist system. As a nation, we will soon need to\naddress other enormous financial challenges, such as reducing the budget deficit and providing\nfuture funding for Social Security and Medicare. We must not fool ourselves that citizens will or should - accept higher taxes or reduced benefits until we have addressed existing\nvulnerabilities in our financial system that risk public funds.\nTo those who say that some firms are too big to fail, I wholeheartedly agree that some are\n\ntoo big. However, these firms can be unwound hi a manner that does not cause ineparable harm\n\nto our economy and financial system but actually strengthens it for the long run. As a regulator\nduring the banking crisis of the 1980s. I was involved in closing hundreds of failed institutions.\n\nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest and most complex bank holding\ncompanies, was taken into receivership is an orderly fashion.\nI have testified before Congress on this issue and recently offered a detailed process that\n\nwould hold the ownership and senior management of these institutions accountable for their\nactions when their firms fail. The businesses would then be restructured through a prescribed\n\nprocess under the rule of law. If you are interested in the details of this plan, I encourage you to\nvisit our website, uw.KansasCitvFed.org, where you can review it in its entirety. I am not\naware of any other proposal that would prevent situations like Bear Steams, Lehman Brothers\n\nand Merrill Lynch from being handled exactly the same way. That is unacceptable.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile some argue that moving legislation quickly forward gives us a better outcome\nsooner, my view is that this approach will result in a set of unintended consequences with a more\nexpensive outcome. I have no doubt that all policymakers involved in the debate have the same\n\ngoals of benefitting the consumer, the industry and the nation’s economy. That is why I believe\nthe full package of regulatory reform deserves more time for careful consideration and national\ndebate, but resolution authority is well over a year too late. The likelihood of real success in\n\nfinancial stability; consumer protection; and; importantly, public confidence in policymakers’\n\n9\n\n\fresolve to fix what actually went wrong in our financial system starts by addressing too-big-tofail.\n\nI know that this is a difficult problem to fully understand, and certainly will be a\n\ncomplicated situation to fix. But we must fix it. Based on experience, my view is that we do not\nhave to subsidize or “learn to live with” the financial oligarchy that exists. Furthermore, our\n\nhandling of too-big-to-fail institutions will define the future role of the United States hi the\nglobal economy. Our failure to insist on a stable, market-based financial system jeopardizes the\n\nU.S. leadership position.\n\nto\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nKansas Bankers Association\n2009 Annual Meeting\nAugust 6, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives. This text was prepared from a transcript of Mr. Hoenig’s remarks.\n\n\fI want to thank the Kansas Bankers Association for inviting me here today and for giving\n\nme the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be increasingly important challenges\n\nconfronting our economy in the coming months and years. The challenges are focused around\nthe common theme of debt and leverage as it impacts the banking industry, government, business\n\nand consumers. How we address these challenges will also affect how the Federal Reserve\nconducts monetary policy as we emerge from this recession and beyond.\nI’ll start by focusing on the banking industry and the challenge of too-big-to-fail. The\n\nmatter of a resolution process for failed large banks must be addressed before the financial\nsystem can be fully healed and functional. Then I will speak on the broader issue of debt, federal\n\ngovernment, business and consumer, and the challenges it presents for policy. These topics are\nimportant because, as citizens, we have some very difficult choices before us that will impact us\n\nand future generations.\n\nThroughout my presentation, I will share a number of charts that illustrate the magnitude\n\nof debt and leverage in the economy.\n\nThe advantages of too-big-to-fail\nChart 1 is a picture of leverage in the banking system and illustrates the enormous\n\nadvantage of being too big to fail. For example, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the 20\nlargest financial institutions in the United States controlled more than $12 trillion in assets,\nsupported by more than 3.5 percent equity capital. This chart illustrates how little equity supports\n\nthat massive amount of assets and risk. The next group of financial institutions, the non-top 20\n\nfinancial institutions ($500 million to $100 billion in assets) has an equity capital ratio of 6\npercent—notably higher than that of the largest banks.\n\n\fChart 1\n\nTier 1 Common as % of Total Assets\n\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 20091\nNotes: Graph includes only BHCs that filed the Y9-C which excludes approximately $2 trillion in assets.\nTier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest.\nNon-Top 20 includes bank holding companies with $500 million to $100 billion in assets.\n\nAssume for a moment that the 20 largest institutions were required either to raise new\n\nequity, or to reduce their total assets to meet the 6 percent equity capital ratio. This would\nrequire that they raise more than $300 billion in new capital or, as Chart 2 shows, they would\nneed to shrink in size by $5 trillion, or some combination of the two options. The numbers in\nChart 2 make clear how much of an advantage the larger institutions have over smaller banks,\n\nand show the excess leverage the largest banks have accumulated.\n\n\fChart 2\nTotal Assets Supported by Existing Tier 1 Common Supported\nAssets assumes 6% Tier 1 Common to Total Assets\n\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition | March 2009]\nNotes: Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest.\n\nIt is no longer conjecture that the largest institutions in the United States have been\n\ndetermined to be too big to fail. They have been bailed out, and proposed legislation allows for\nthat practice to continue. They have an implied guarantee, which affords them an enormous\n\nadvantage in terms of their use of leverage and their ability to accumulate assets to\nunprecedented levels.\n\nThe large banks have added capital since the end of the first quarter, but they are far short\nof achieving a 6 percent ratio of equity capital to assets. Ironically perhaps, some proposals\nbeing offered would require large institutions to hold more than this level of capital. I would\n\n\fsuggest such proposals are wishful thinking, and will not be achieved. I would be pleased if\nthese largest institutions were held to the same standards as the non-top 20 firms because the\n\ncommunity banking system cannot survive if the largest banks continue with their current\n\nadvantage, and that obviously has significant adverse effects for the financial system as a whole.\nThere were two pieces of legislation that facilitated our migration toward too big to fail.\n\nChart 3 illustrates the relative growth in position of the largest institutions against the timeline of\n\nInterstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which permitted banks to grow across\n\nstate lines, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which eliminated the separation of commercial\nbanking and investment banking. Since 1990, the largest 20 institutions grew from controlling\n\nabout 35 percent of industry assets to controlling 70 percent of assets today. This trend will\n\ncontinue unless we take specific steps to end it.\n\nThe way we normally address failure in a capitalistic system is to subject any institution,\nfrom the largest institution to the smallest, to the same penalties for bad management. To\naccomplish this, we must pass legislation mandating that institutions that become insolvent, due\nto liquidity or capital, be taken over in an orderly fashion and placed under a conservatorship or\nreceivership. In such an instance, both the equity holders and long-term debt holders should\n\nshare the losses before the taxpayer is required to bail out the institution. Taking over the failed\ninstitution in an orderly fashion—not a panicked fashion—would protect the franchise and, more\n\nimportantly, protect the economy from instability.\n\nAs I have described elsewhere, a resolution framework can be designed that is fair and\nmuch more efficient for the economy. As we have handled the largest institutions through this\n\ncrisis, they are not market-driven institutions, they are public utilities. This has to change or we\n\n\fwill not retain the dynamic financial system that has made the United States so successful over\n\nits history.\n\nCharts\nIndustry Concentration in Top Bank Holding Companies\n\nSources: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated ConditionParent Company Only Financial StatementsConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income\n\nNotes: *Riegle*Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency' Act of 1994 allowed for interstate acquisitions\n\nDifficult choices\n\nWhile staying with the theme of debt and difficult choices, I am going to turn next to the\nchallenge of the growing debt levels within our economy and the challenges they present for\n\nmonetary policy makers, starting with federal debt levels.\n\n\fIt is the responsibility of us citizens, through our congressional representatives, to decide\nhow much our government spends and how we allocate those expenditures, which nominally\nincreased to $3 trillion in 2008 from less than $500 billion in 1975. Medicare, income security,\n\nSocial Security and veteran’s benefits make up more than half of government spending. Federal\n\noutlays also include national defense, education, interest payments on the debt and other\nexpenditures. These expenditures are substantial, and they may grow further as we set forth on\nimplementing a stimulus package and tackle some very difficult health-care issues. Both these\ninitiatives involve legitimate goals, and it is not my place here to debate the merits or the\n\narguments surrounding them. However, as Chart 4 shows, we need to understand that we,\nthrough our government, have already made significant long-term commitments and choices in\n\nallocating federal resources.\nChart 4\n\nSource OMB. Dara for 1975 is the average for 1974*1976, data for 1985 is rhe average for 1984*1986,\nand data for 1995 is rhe average of 1994-1996- The number on the right is the percent of outlays.\n\n\fIf our government is going to spend a total of $3 trillion a year, it must obtain the\nrevenues to do so. If we are not willing to tax ourselves, then funds must be borrowed. Chart 5\nshows that in nominal terms, the total federal debt has grown from less than $500 billion in 1975\nto approximately $12 trillion, and over that same period, our debt-to-GDP ratio has increased\nfrom 35 percent to 90 percent. We are spending 8 percent of our total federal budget just to\n\nmake the interest payments on that debt, and that too will only increase.\n\nCharts\nTotal Federal Debt\n\nEnd of Fiscal Year\nSource: OMB, BEA, calculation.\n\n\fWhile our federal debt level is significant, we must consider more than the government’s\ndebt as we evaluate the economy. Chart 6 shows that consumer and nonfinancial business debt\n\nare each now more than 130 percent of our national income. Consumer leverage has actually\n\nworsened as consumer wealth has declined during this recession due to the collapse in housing\nand the decline in U.S. equity markets.\n\nChart 6\nDebt\n\nIn an environment where debt is large and growing, low interest rates are preferred by\nnearly everyone: the government, bankers and bank customers. The desire for low interest rates\n\nwill put incredible pressure on the Federal Reserve and the central banks of the world to keep\nrates low. Since Paul Volcker broke the inflationary cycle of the late ’70s and early ’80s, Chart 7\n\n\fshows that there has been a sustained downward movement of the federal funds rate—which\naffects interest rates broadly—and this has encouraged the use of debt to finance a broad range of\npurchases. Consequently, we are carrying more debt than we have carried in most of our\n\nhistory, and the pressure to keep rates low is only going to increase as the economy begins to\n\nrecover from this recession.\n\nChart?\nFederal Funds Rate\n\nChart 8 shows that low interest rates have coincided with a growing level of money in the\neconomy, which the Federal Reserve defines as M2. Chart 9 suggests further that this growth in\n\nmoney over these past several decades has had a staggering effect on the consumer price level.\nSince the founding of the Federal Reserve some 95 years ago, the consumer price level index has\n\n\frisen to a level of2200 from a level of 100. That’s an astonishing increase in the general price\nlevel, and it represents a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar over time.\n\nThese are matters that demand our attention as we make choices involving both fiscal and\n\nmonetary policy.\n\nCharts\nMoney\n\nSource: Board of Governors. Money is defined as M2, a broad set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of die sum of (1) currency, (2) traveler’s checks,\n(3) demand deposits, (4) other checkable deposits, (5) savings deposits, (6) small-denomination rime deposits, and (7) balances in retail money market mutual funds.\n\nIn considering these charts and the matters of policy, we should be aware of two pieces of\nlegislation that I suggest influenced their contours: the 1946 Employment Act and the 1977\n\nAmendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The 1946 Employment Act established as a national\n\npriority a goal of low unemployment. Low unemployment is a worthy goal and one that I share,\nbut it cannot be achieved by systematically keeping interest rates low. In 1977, Congress passed\n\nthe Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act—also called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act—which\n\n\fcalled upon the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, to pursue a dual\nmandate of promoting long-run stable economic growth and stable prices.\nChart 9\nConsumer Price Index\n\nThough I am convinced we can achieve both mandates, I also am convinced that both are\n\nonly possible if the first priority of the central bank is to achieve stable prices. Understandably,\n\nhowever, many prefer that the emphasis be on growth and low unemployment. Although the\nFederal Reserve is insulated from politics, it is not isolated from politics, as you can observe by\nthe frequent congressional testimony of Ben Bernanke and past chairmen. The Federal Reserve\n\nSystem is accountable to Congress for achieving the dual mandate, and the data suggest it has\n\ngiven important deference to the growth objective.\n\n\fRecession and recovery\nThese issues provide context for the monetary policy choices that lie ahead. Based on the\ndata we are receiving today, it would appear that we are at the bottom of the recession. The data\nare mixed, which is usually a sign that we are at the bottom. However, these mixed data also\nmake it difficult to determine just how firmly or quickly we will emerge from the recession.\nGiven the large amounts of consumer, business and government debt that will influence events\n\ngoing forward, I suspect we’re going to recover slowly. The recovery will be assisted by the\nfiscal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, but it most likely will be slowed by the\nextensive rebalancing of the economy that has yet to occur.\nIn this environment, one of the Federal Reserve’s major challenges will be how to pull\n\nback its highly accommodative monetary policy without undermining the recovery and not\nigniting inflationary expectations. We learned in the Great Depression and with the Japanese\n\nexperience that we have to pull back gently. At the same time, however, we also learned from\nthe great inflation of the ’70s that we have to be resolute in pulling excess stimulus back or risk\ngreater consequences in the future. We are going to be walking the “knife’s edge” for some time\n\nto come.\n\nIn considering this challenge it is important also to realize first that more than half of the\n\ncurrent fiscal stimulus package has yet to be spent, so we have yet to see its full effects. In\n\naddition, monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will provide significant\nstimulus into 2010 and beyond.\n\nFocusing more narrowly on monetary policy, the excess reserves in the banking system\nnow exceed $800 billion; they were less than $8 billion when this recession started. The balance\n\nsheets of the Federal Reserve Banks have increased from $900 billion to more than $2 trillion in\n\n\fless than two years. As we become more confident that we are at the bottom of the recession and\nare moving into recovery, we must become more resolute in systematically reducing our balance\nsheet and raising interest rates to levels we might all agree are more in line with the economy’s\n\nlong-run growth path. Moving from zero to one percent, for example, is not a tight policy. I\ndon’t know what the neutral rate is, but I am certain it isn’t zero.\n\nIf the monetary stimulus does not come out, the price level trend shown earlier in Chart 9\nwill only worsen. As a reminder of what that might imply, you need only study the early ’80s\nwhen high inflation undermined our economic system. Paul Volcker’s efforts to bring inflation\n\ndown then were not without cost and required that the country suffer through a recession nearly\nas bad as the one we hope we are exiting now.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the government, the banks and consumers address the difficult issues of debt and the\nFederal Reserve begins to remove the significant stimulus in an orderly fashion, then we will\ncome out of this recession without an inflationary hangover. Noninflationary growth will follow,\n\nnew wealth will be generated, and we will continue to be the strongest, most successful economy\nin the world. But in the short run, these actions will involve painful choices, and it is the\n\nresponsibility of citizens like you, and policy makers like me, to consider the impact of today’s\n\nchoices on tomorrow. We must choose well.\n\n\f"

        "content": "CAPITALISM\n.AND\nTHE PROCESS OF RENEWAL\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\n“Bankruptcy and the Financial Crisis”\nStem School of Business, New York University\nNew York, N.Y.\nJune 30, 2009\n\n\fIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me here today for what is an especially timely discussion.\nThose who are familiar with my public remarks know that I do not accept that some firms\n\nare “too big to fail.” I do not believe it's inevitable or desirable to continue to have too-big-to-\n\nfail financial institutions because they pose an ongoing threat to financial stability. Now is the\ntime to seriously consider a mandatory resolution process based on an objective set of criteria\n\nthat puts the largest financial organizations on notice they won’t receive a disproportionate\nsubsidy or guarantee.\n\nWhen the financial crisis was unfolding, public authorities responded with a number of\n\nad hoc steps. These actions kept afloat several large financial and nonfinancial firms whose\ncollapse many thought would prove devastating to the financial system and the economy. The\n\nnames of the institutions are well known: AIG, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and\nMerrill Lynch. There were also initiatives to support financial sector Finns through TARP\nmoney.\n\nWith few exceptions, the steps taken to support these firms were outside the normal\nframework established to deal with troubled entities. Hie related actions raise important\n\nquestions around too big to fail and whether traditional corporate bankruptcy procedures and\nbank receiverships are adequate to the task of resolving failed firms. The options chosen also\nraise important issues of fairness and the equity of outcomes. We know that public assistance\n\ninvolves political choice, which too often undermines market discipline and the process of failure\n\nand renewal so essential to the long-run success of our capitalistic system.\n\n2\n\n\fIn my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss the role that I believe bankruptcy and bank\nreceivership authority must play in a financial crisis, the lessons we should learn from our recent\nexperience, and what steps we should put in place to deal with future disruptions.\n\nThe resolution of depository institutions and corporate bankruptcies\n\nManaging insolvency for depository institutions differs markedly from what we do with\n\nmost other corporations. Although we have many experts here on both bank resolution and\n\ncorporate bankruptcy, I would like to briefly compare these approaches before discussing issues\naround the resolution of large failing institutions.\n\nOur approach in dealing with insolvent banks is largely based on the idea that because\nbanks serve a critical role in the payments and credit systems, their failures involve potential\n\ncostly externalities. Bank failures, of any size, could lead to significant disruptions in the ability\nof individuals and businesses within a community to carry out timely transactions. Furthermore,\nif the largest institutions are involved, these disruptions could bring about a systemic breakdown\nin financial markets and cause substantial harm to the overall economy.\n\nThe primary focus in bank resolutions is to protect depositors at the least cost to the\n\ninsurance fund and, wherever possible, ensure continued access to banking services with\nminimal disruption to the overall economy. This requires timely action. As such, bank\n\nresolutions occur under an administrative process with the FDIC acting as receiver. The FDIC\n\nhas a number of “superpowers” it can use in its role, including the ability to reorganize or\nrestructure a failed bank, sell portions of the bank's assets and operations, and repudiate certain\ntypes of claims and contracts.\n\nOverall, the bank resolution process moves quickly through prescribed steps.\n\n3\n\n\fThe failure of nonfinancial corporations involves a more deliberative process. Although\nthe failure of these firms may have a significant effect on individuals and economic outcomes,\nthey do not pose the same type of liquidity and systemic issues as the failure of a bank.\n\nConsequently, the resolution process differs in some important ways from that of banks; most\n\nnotably the resolutions are handled through the bankruptcy courts and are initiated either by a\nfirm’s creditors or its managers. The court process concentrates on maximizing the value of the\n\nfnm and the creditors’ claims either through the film’s liquidation or as an ongoing concern.\nBankruptcy courts, moreover, could be characterized as part of a “time out” process in which\nneutral judges work with creditors and other parties to resolve conflicts of interest and protect\n\ncreditors.\nDespite the differences in these two processes, there are important commonalities as well.\n\nIn both cases there is a strict set of procedures established under the rule of law that sets out, for\nexample, a “priority of claims.” Also, both focus on an orderly process and equitable outcomes\n\nwith care being taken to minimize political factors that might otherwise interfere with the\n\nresolution process.\n\nLessons to be learned\n\nAlthough we have a legal framework for dealing with failing institutions, we have\nlearned that, in a crisis, the “systemic spillover” that can emerge from failures of our largest\n\ninstitutions and the threat to the broad economy require additional consideration. The most\n\nrecent examples of this have led to the suspension of normal bankruptcy and bank resolution\nprocesses, thus institutionalizing the concept of too big to fail in our economic system.\n\n4\n\n\fEven outside of the banking system, major securities firms and AIG, an insurance\ncompany, were thought to be systemically significant because of their many connections and\nexposures with other firms and markets. Therefore, it was concluded they could not be put\n\nthrough bankruptcy. Many view the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and its aftermath as a\njustification for bailing out other large financial institutions.\nBut we have also learned, or been reminded, that too big to fail has adverse consequences\nas well. Eveiy financial crisis leaves a trail of losses embedded among market participants. The\n\nprocess of recovery must start with the recognition of these losses, which then must be\ndistributed among the participants. Moreover, in some instances the extent of the losses\n\nultimately requires the recapitalization or closing of the institutions and the replacement of the\nmanagement responsible for the failure. When exceptions are made to tills process for any set of\ninstitutions, especially our largest, this process of recovery is delayed or compromised. In\n\naddition, taxpayers most often must bear the burden of recapitalizing too-big-to-fail institutions,\nplacing billions of dollars of their funds at risk. And too often, the management who created the\n\nproblems or who failed to demonstrate the leadership necessary to properly run the institution\nremains in place.\nSuch interventions tend to break down market discipline and involve public authorities,\n\nnot the market, choosing winners and losers. In FDIC receivership or bankruptcy, instihitions\n\nand claimants must deal with using tested procedures and a set of rules that help ensure that all\nparties, regardless of size, are heated comparably. With too big to fail, this process is suspended\n\nand films are heated differently based on one criterion: size.\n\n5\n\n\fThus, while in the middle of a crisis, short cuts to tested resolution processes may appear\n\nand even be necessary, they almost certainly leave us with a less efficient and less competitive\n\nmarketplace.\n\nWhat steps should we take?\n\nAs policymakers consider the administration’s recent proposal for a new resolution\nauthority for systemically important financial institutions, it is crucial that we ask ourselves\n\nseveral important questions. For example, given what we have learned from this crisis, how can\n\nwe address the issue of systemic vulnerability that is inherent in any system with institutions\n\nallowed to be too big to fail? How can we better assure that managers, stockholders and\ncreditors know that there will be a credible system that puts them at risk? And how can we\n\nresolve large institutions without raising systemic concerns or disrupting key financial activities\nor markets? I suggest there are three fundamental steps to addressing the matter of too big to\nfail.\n\nFirst, there needs to be a set of basic rules of performance that apply to systemically\nimportant institutions. I would emphasize that these rules need to be easily understood and\nenforceable. For example, I strongly support simple leverage standards for setting capital\nrequirements at financial institutions. Leverage restrictions, once assigned, are simple to\n\nunderstand and calculate. They are straightforward to enforce and, if enforced appropriately, are\ncountercyclical. Risk-based capital standards, in contrast, are complex, procyclical, and easier to\n\navoid. Many institutions, in fact, have significantly underestimated their risk exposure over the\nlast few years. These errors could have left them with even greater capital shortages if they had\n\nbeen free to follow a tine risk-based capital approach. While no system is perfect, clear and firm\n\n6\n\n\frules are easier to understand and enforce. Principles-based oversight is an exercise in\n\nphilosophy, not a supervisory framework.\nSecond, there must be a clearly defined resolution regime for systemically important\n\nfirms that are in financial trouble. When addressing serious problems, such a regime should set\nforth fundamental steps that ensure a continuity of key operations but which also carefully\n\nconfine policymakers from making special exceptions to a defined process.\n\nSome have well illustrated the responses associated with the recent crises to an\nemergency crew acting to save a burning home before it destroys the entire neighborhood. I\nagree that acting to save the neighborhood was important. However, to extend the metaphor, if\n\nthe fire was started by a homeowner who ignored fire codes and smoked in bed, should the\n\nneighbors be required to rebuild the home at twice its original size at their expense?\n\nWhile we could have addressed the too big to fail issue with current tools, a statutorily\nsanctioned resolution process would significantly improve our ability to deal with failed large\nbank holding companies and large nonbank financial institutions. The Treasury Department’s\n\nplan for Financial Regulatory Reform and its resolution regime for failing bank and other\n\nfinancial holding companies provide a starting point for discussing the issue of too big to fail\ninstitutions, but it is only a start.\n\nIn the proposal there are a number of issues that deserve careful consideration. They\ninclude, for example, how solvency recommendations would be determined among the\nconsolidated and financial subsidiary regulators. Also, the process will need to be much more\nspecific in how we determine which institutions and activities would be regarded as systemic and\n\ncome under the federal safety net or public protection. For example, I would limit such\n\nboundaries to those institutions that are directly and indirectly part of our economy’s plumbing:\n\n7\n\n\four system for payments and for the provision of liquidity. Inside these boundaries would be all\n\nbanks and bank holding companies and any institution that has direct access to the payments\n\nsystem and to the Federal Reserve discount window. On the other hand, hedge funds would be\n\noutside the boundaries of the safety net, although they could be required to register and report\nunder SEC rules. The plan must also more precisely define how the cost of resolving a large\ninstitution would best be distributed. Such costs are substantial and should be allocated to those\n\ninstitutions that benefit the most from the public safety net.\nThe most important part of any plan, however, will be the requirement that public\n\nauthorities resolve such institutions by taking them into receivership and restructuring them to\nemerge under new and more careful management and ownership. This step should be taken\n\nwhenever the chartering and supervisory authorities judge an institution to be insolvent horn a\n\nliquidity or balance sheet perspective, and I would advocate no exceptions. If a resolution\n\nprocess exists, then few, if any, exceptions will be necessary.\nUnder the pressure of a crisis, as we have seen, it is difficult to avoid a piecemeal\n\napproach to dealing with systemically important institutions with all of the unintended\n\nconsequences that seem to follow. Thus, our energies in refining the proposed legislation should\nfocus on how best to narrow the exceptions and assure that a receivership or bankruptcy\n\nframework operates according to the rule of law and insulated from political interference. In\n\nbanking, Congress has set the receivership rules with independent regulators making solvency\ndecisions and carrying out the resolution process. A similar format must be part of the resolution\n\nprocess for systemically important, large financial organizations.\n\n8\n\n\fThird, in resolving issues around any failed firm, especially too big to fail firms,\nmanagement and stockholders must be accountable for their actions. Restructured firms must\n\nhave new - and more careful - management and ownership.\nToo often institutions drift without a clear vision of the organization’s goals with no one\n\nmaking the hard decisions. Other shortcomings include a failure or unwillingness to understand\nthe financial instruments the institution holds, relying on mechanics rather than sound judgment.\nToo often management has a greater concern for expanding the balance sheet than for managing\n\nexistirrg activities. Within today’s largest organizations, we have learned of individuals who\nwillingly carried a hefty title for the purpose of representation of the organization but with no\n\nunderstanding - and no requirement or desire to understand - the business lines, operations or\ncondition of the organization. From the volume of complaints blaming rating agencies for the\n\ncurrent crisis, it seems that far too few senior executives in these largest organizations believed it\n\nwas their responsibility to understand the financial products their company was buying and\ntrading in quantities of billions and trillions of dollars. This is not only unacceptable, but also a\ndereliction of duty.\n\nDealing with leadership issues is challenging and should be addressed by respective\nboards and stockholders. But if a board fails to do so, then the company’s likelihood of failure\n\nincreases. When failure occurs, certainly new management must be required as part of any\n\nresolution process. One might observe that a CEO and his board of directors are hardly in a\nposition to be angry with any government-imposed restrictions on compensation when they\n\nneglected their responsibility to manage a sound company.\nA final point that needs to be highlighted is that there must be confidence in the fairness\nof any resolution process if it is to be successfill over time. Capitalism works only if all\n\n9\n\n\fcompetitors are held to the same standard and have equal opportunities to succeed or fail. With\n\ntoo big to fail, capitalism is compromised and equity of opporhmity is sacrificed to expediency.\n\nThe vast majority of banks in the United States have complied with regulations and\nrequirements that, though necessary, are costly. These banks have played by the rules or suffered\n\nthe consequences of not doing so during market turmoil. Understandably, today these smaller\ninstitutions are concerned about the prospect of increased regulatory requirements and an\n\nincreased competitive advantage that flows to the largest firms. Such an outcome would\nundermine confidence in the market system that has brought this country past success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current crisis has made it clear that the group of systemically important firms that\nmight be deemed worthy of special consideration by policymakers is larger than previously\nthought. Tlris extension of the too big to fail concept, along with the wide variety of public\n\nassistance and guarantees we’ve seen used in recent months, make it even more important that\n\npolicymakers find ways to deal with large failing institutions.\n\nFailing to have a process that operates according to the rule of law and is free of political\n\ninfluence means an even larger section of our financial markets will operate on the assumption\n\nthat the idea of failure - a key element in market discipline - does not apply in all instances.\nOnce this happens, it will be difficult for other institutions to survive and compete, and for our\nmarkets to be competitive and efficient. Importantly, it will not be realistic for any authority in\nany regulatory structure to oversee a system where incentives remain to take on excessive risk.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSheridan, Wyo.\nJune 3, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors,\nofficers or representatives.\n\n\f2\n\nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak with you here in Sheridan today. It is\na pleasure to be here, and it has been a genuine opportunity for the directors and staff of the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to learn first hand what is happening in this part of our\nregion.\n\nIn thinking about the long run while contemplating the current economic situation, I\nwould humbly amend the famous observation of economist John Maynard Keynes. In the long\nrun, we are all dead but our children will be left to pick up the tab. With that in mind, today I\nwill focus on some of the longer-run challenges we face as we emerge from the current financial\n\nand economic crisis. These challenges can most certainly be dealt with, but they require that we\nbegin now to address them genuinely and systematically or we risk repeating past mistakes and\n\ncreating an environment that leads to our next set of crises.\n\nNear-term outlook\n\nI’ll begin my remarks by stating that my view of the more immediate outlook for the U.S.\n\neconomy is that we will emerge from this recession - perhaps as soon as the second half of this\nyear, but most likely in early 2010, as many economists project. If for no other reason, the\n\neconomy should respond positively to the significant degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus that\n\nhas been directed into the economy over the past several months. Let me briefly describe those\nactions.\nMonetary policy is enormously accommodative, with the fed funds rate being near zero.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s lending programs and support of the housing market provides significant\n\nadditional liquidity and stimulus to our financial markets and economy. The Federal Reserve is\nin the process of purchasing longer-term assets including Treasury securities, which adds\n\n\f3\n\nsignificant stimulus. In total, these actions will increase the Federal Reserve Banks’ combined\nbalance sheets to more than $3 billion from less than $1 trillion less than two years ago.\n\nFiscal policy also has been highly expansionary and will provide billions in stimulus over\nthe coming quarters and years. For example, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) placed\n$700 billion into die financial industry and parts of the auto industry just within the past eight\n\nmonths. The fiscal stimulus package recently implemented into law provides nearly $800 billion\n\nin tax cuts, grants to state governments, expanded jobless benefits and significant infrastructure\n\nspending on highways and other transportation enhancements, and on clean energy initiatives\nthat are unprecedented in size and scope. Frankly, it would be surprising if the economy failed to\nrecover based on the magnitude of these monetary and fiscal programs.\nDespite these actions, I expect the recovery to be more modest than some economists\n\nproject. The U.S. economy is working through a series of difficult structural adjustments, as are\n\nmarry of our trading partners. Our financial institutions remain fragile and will require significant\nadditional amounts of capital to regain then stability. How we choose to do this will affect the\n\npublic’s confidence in these institutions and their ability to support the recovery. The housing\nmarket continues to struggle as it downsizes from past financial and speculative excesses and the\n\nassociated misallocation of resources. Consumers are adjusting to a significant loss in wealth\nassociated with the declining housing and stock markets, and job losses. Recovery in these\n\ncircumstances will take time and require patience if we are to avoid mistakes in our efforts to\nbring the economy forward.\n\nThus, while I am convinced that the economic recovery we all want will develop, it will\n\nbe slower and more fragile than we hope for.\n\n\f4\n\nFixes for the long run\nThis recession is often described as the worst in post-World War II history, and that may\n\nvery well be correct. From it will flow a host of policy issues that will require careful review and\nhard choices if we are to assure our national economy’s long-term strength and vitality. In this\nregard, I would like to direct the remainder of my remarks to three policy issues: the need to\naddress fundamental weaknesses within our financial system; the need to address significant\n\nimbalances within the U.S. economy; and the need to act to avoid an inflationary outbreak that\ncould come with current fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nThe financial system\n\nOver the past year, we have seen the U.S. financial system nearly collapse. Financial\ninstitution failures have included Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, and Lehman Brothers.\nMeanwhile, billions of dollars in taxpayer money have been needed by CitiGroup, Bank of\n\nAmerica and AIG. The panic that followed these events affected the broader economy,\nworsening the current recession. It is apparent that we need a better set of incentives within the\n\nindustry and better oversight by the regulatory authorities if we are to avoid a repeat of these\n\nevents in the future. Moreover, if we hesitate to make needed changes, we will perpetuate an\n\noligarchy of interests that will fail to serve the best interest of business, the consumer and the\nU.S. economy.\nIn our efforts to fix the oversight process for our financial system, we should not\n\nmisdiagnose the patient. Unfortunately, I’m afraid we are witnessing some regulatory\nmalpractice now. The emphasis on reform at this moment is to change the structure of the\n\nregulatory system rather than address the fundamental weakness of that system. Leading to this\n\ncrisis were a series of steps that eliminated or compromised financial standards that had saved to\n\n\f5\n\nsupport sound financial practices for generations. For the most pari, these titles were simple in\n\nform, understandable and enforceable. They served to constrain excessive leverage and\n\nundisciplined growth using simple leverage ratios, and they focused on fundamental\nunderwriting standards such as limits on loan-to-value. Accordingly, I am convinced that before\n\nwe spend time and energy restructuring the regulatory system, we should first determine which\ntitles of conduct should be reintroduced and enforced to provide for better outcomes. Perhaps in\n\nthe end there will be consensus to change our oversight structure, but I suspect reestablishing and\nthen enforcing rules that have proven effective over time will do more than the make-work\n\nexercise of regulatory restructuring. After all, England has one regulator and has fared no better\n\nin the current financial crisis.\n\nIn discussing any aspect of financial reform, one of the most significant changes that\nmust be accomplished is the end of “Too Big To Fail.” If nothing else, this current financial\n\ncrisis has confirmed its existence. Capitalism is a process of success, failure and renewal, and\nfor it to work properly, institutions must be allowed to fail, no matter their size or political\ninfluence. Institutions that are considered too big to fail have an implied subsidy. Research\nsuggests that these films are thought to have a lower cost of funds and a competitive advantage\n\nover their less “systemically important” competitors. Too big to fail introduces a “moral\nhazard” problem for society where creditors of these firms lessen their due-diligence programs\n\nknowing that they will be bailed out by the government should the institutions fail. The effect is\n\nto lower the costs to these films and significantly raise costs to the taxpayer and, ultimately, to\nfundamentally weaken our financial system.\n\nFinally, ending too big to fail is not the same as endorsing a disorderly liquidation\nprocess for institutions. Rather it demands a market-oriented solution to poor performance. It\nrequires a resolution process that holds management and investors accountable for their actions\n\n\f6\n\nand, properly structured, it provides for an orderly transition to new ownership or the closing of\n\nthe institution with the least disruption to the market and economy. I have previously outlined\nvarious examples of how this might be done based on what has worked in our financial history\n\nand in other countries. It is imperative that we learn from these examples. If we do not address\nthis issue, we will certainly invite a repeat of the recent financial turmoil and its devastating\n\neffect on our economy.\n\nImbalances and economic stability\n\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. has created for itseIf a set of economic imbalances\nthat, in my judgment, have significantly increased uncertainty and placed economic growth at\n\nrisk for future generations of Americans. That is a serious statement to make, so let me set out a\n\nfew facts to illustrate my point. As a nation, the U.S. has been living beyond its means for many\nyears. The U.S. current account balance since 1990 has declined steadily from approximately in\nbalance to a deficit of 6.5 percent of our GDP in 2005, and it remains at nearly 4 percent of GDP\n\ntoday. At its peak, this equates to almost $900 billion that the U.S. has borrowed from the rest of\nthe world on an annual basis. If this were being used to finance productive investment, I would\nnot be overly concerned because the returns we earn could finance the cost of borrowing.\n\nUnfortunately, however, a large share of U.S. imports is for consumption.\nThe reality of this imbalance is brought further into focus when we realize that U.S.\n\nconsumption as a percent of GDP has increased from an already relatively high 66 percent in\n1990 to 70 percent in 2006 and remains near this level even today. Just as significant is the fact\n\nthat U.S. aggregate personal savings had fallen from an already low rate of 5 percent of GDP in\n1990 to near zero in 2006. More significant still is the fact that for the same period, consumer\ndebt to income increased from a high of 84 percent to nearly 135 percent.\n\n\f7\n\nFinally, our federal government has, except for a short period at the end of the ’90s, run\n\nits own chronic annual deficit, which is projected to approach $2 trillion this fiscal year and will\nremain large for years to come. Moreover, these projections do not include the effects of\n\nadditional trillions of dollars of unfunded promises we have made to ourselves to provide Social\nSecurity and Medicare benefits for decades to come.\n\nBecause the U.S. economy is so large and, by historical standards, so successfill, it has\nthe capacity to cany such imbalances far longer than most economies would be permitted in\n\ntoday’s global markets. However, such an advantage will eventually end and comes with its own\ncosts. Over time, an ever-increasing amount of national and personal debt will raise the cost of\ncapital. As these costs increase, investment will slow and cause lower productivity, yet an\n\nimproving level of productivity is what is required to maintain a high standard of living. The\ndecrease in economic growth will most likely come slowly and be modest, but its compounding\neffects over future generations will be significant. For example, over a 25-year period, a 25-\n\nbasis-point reduction in real GDP growth would imply a difference of nearly 6 percent in the\nlevel of GDP, all else equal, as we economists like to say. In other words, seemingly small\npercentages can have an enormous impact on future generations.\n\nThe inflation challenge\n\nIt is one thing to outline the challenges we face, it is quite another to address them. To\nillustrate this point, I would direct you to an article by Martin Barnes, the managing editor of\nThe Bank Credit Analyst, published this May. In estimating the effect on consumption growth if\nthe annual savings rate steadily increased from zero toward 8 percent between now and the end\n\nof 2013, the article suggests that consumer spending would grow at an average rate of only 1.3\npercent per year. This would be a significant reduction of consumption growth, the slowest since\n\n\f8\n\nthe 1930s. There can be little doubt that such a growth rate would have a significant adjustment\n\neffect, even if only temporary, not only on the U.S., but also on the rest of the world. For the\n\nU.S., it most likely would imply the need to shift resources toward the export sector, and for our\nhading partners, it would mean relying less on sales to the U.S.\n\nStarting from where we are today, it is clear that interest rates must rise. As the economy\nrecovers, even at a modest pace, resource demands will begin to increase. At this point, the\ncurrent level of monetary accommodation will need to be withdrawn to avoid introducing\ninflationary impulses. Also, with the almost certain adjustments that need to occur in\nconsumption, savings and the rebalancing of imports and exports, I expect there would be\n\nadditional pressure for interest rates to rise steadily over time. To the extent that these\nadjustments will require considerable time to complete, unemployment levels, for example, may\n\ndecline more slowly than anyone wants.\nIf such a set of events occurs, then I also suspect there will be considerable pressure on\nthe central bank to “help out” in easing this adjustment process by keeping interest rates low for\n\nan extended period. This happens because people often confuse the establishment of low interest\nrates - and therefore the creation of money - with the creation of wealth. Sadly, through history,\n\nit has been shown repeatedly that excessive reliance on monetary policy as a means to avoid\nfundamental economic policy choices leads to high inflation and an actual worsening of an\n\neconomy’s long-term performance. I hope the U.S. can avoid the temptation to take policy short\ncuts as we emerge from this recession. We face difficult adjustments that must yet be made. The\n\nprocess will not be free of pain.\n\n\f9\n\nThe Federal Reserve System over the past nearly two years has more than doubled its\nbalance sheet as it has provided liquidity and monetary stimulus to the U.S. and world economy.\n\nIn doing so, it has saved to staunch the financial and economic panic. But it now must turn to\nthe matter of carefully removing this stimulus at the very time that consumers, businesses and the\n\ngovernment will need to fund pent-up demand for goods and services and to meet committed\nobligations. There is little doubt that such a “coincidence” of needs will place upward pressure\n\non interest rates. Central banks will have little choice but to allow these increases to occur or\nrisk the consequence of higher inflation, perhaps significantly higher. As I said, this process of\nremoving past monetary accommodation will be resisted. However, in contemplating this\n\nprocess and the pain of adjustment, I often emphasize that inflation is the least fair, most\nregressive and most corrosive tax we can impose on ourselves. It is particularly harsh for low- to\n\nmoderate-income citizens.\n\nFinally, the markets won’t be fooled by artificially low rates for long. Market\nparticipants realize that a period of high deficits and accommodative monetary policy are an\n\ninvitation to increased inflationary pressure. I suspect we are experiencing the first signs of the\nmarkets’ concerns in the rising rates and increased volatility in longer-term Treasury markets. I\n\nsuggest strongly that we need to be alert to the markets’ message and begin in earnest to bring\nmonetary policy into better balance before inflation forces our hand.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we emerge from this global financial crisis and recession, the United States must\naddress a series of significant financial and economic imbalances and risks. In dealing with\nthese challenges, the Federal Reserve must stay focused on our mission and make the tough - if\n\n\f10\n\nunpopular - decisions that will help guide our economy into better condition. A central bank’s\nmission remains that of holding the trust of the public by providing a stable currency that retains\n\nits purchasing power over time. It is for governments and businesses to allocate resources that\naddress our economic challenges. These are not things that a central bank should address\n\ndirectly. No matter how well-intentioned, to attempt to do so goes beyond its mission and risks\ndelaying and worsening the inevitable adjustment.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Future of Retail Banking and Payments—Developments in Global Markets\nThe Role of Central Banks\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nECB/De Nederlandsche Bank Conference,\nFrankfurt,\nMay 25,2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\f2\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be here today and participate in this conference on retail\nbanking and the role of central banks. It is a pleasure for me to join you and provide my\n\nperspective on the U.S. retail payments system.\nDiscussion regarding this topic could not be more timely. Retail payments in the United\nStates and worldwide have undergone an enormous transformation over the past decade driven\nby technology and, just as importantly, notable changes in consumer preference. We get a sense\n\nof this change from a recent Federal Reserve study indicating that electronic payments now\nexceed two-thirds of all noncash payments in the United States. The efficiency, convenience,\n\nspeed and ease of use have fueled this transformation and will continue to do so for some time to\ncome.\nConsistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to ensure the integrity and efficiency of\nthe payments system, we were a strong advocate of the migration of payments to electronic\n\nmechanisms. Though the electronic nature of retail payments has affected the Federal Reserve’s\ntraditional role, the Federal Reserve’s mandate has not changed. Although some question\n\nwhether the Federal Reserve can or should play an important role hr retail payments over the\n\nlong term, a strong case can be made for expanding the Federal Reserve’s role in electronic\npayments if it is to fillfill its mandate.\n\nToday I will discuss my own view that the Federal Reserve should not be contemplating\nan exit from retail payments. Coupled with the rise in electronic payments products, a dramatic\nchange hi the structure of the payments industry has introduced new challenges to assuring the\n\ncompetitiveness and safety of this system. The industry’s structure has been heavily influenced\nby economies of scale, which has brought with it an increased level of concentration in debit and\n\ncredit markets. For example, in 2007, the three largest PIN debit networks handled more than 81\n\n\f3\n\npercent of all transaction volume. Comparatively, in 1995, the three largest networks controlled\n\nonly 46 percent of the market. More striking, perhaps, is the fact that over the same period, the\nnumber of networks chopped from 43 to 14. Similar trends are evident in signature debit and\n\ncredit card issuance. And, of course, in the United States, three networks have long dominated\ncredit card clearing. To me, these developments raise important concerns about the\n\ncompetitiveness of card payments systems.\nThere are also reasons to be concerned about the integrity of this system. Growing levels\n\nof concentr ation and an increasing complexity of systems have invited greater vulnerability to\ndisruption and an enhanced potential for “single points of failure.” The increasing complexity\n\nhas raised the opportunity for fraud. There also has been a growth in the prominence of\nnonbanks, introducing new risks to the system.\nIn light of these developments. I believe that the Federal Reserve needs to continue\n\nplaying a strong role hr retail payments. Before looking more closely at what role the Federal\n\nReserve could play in the future, it may be useful to consider the economic rationale for central\nbank involvement hr retail payments more generally. This ratiorrale revolves around the\n\nexistence of externalities that potentially undermine the efficiency and integrity of payments\n\nsystems.\nPayments products and services require a critical mass of participants on two sides of a\nmarket. For example, a sigmfrcant number of merchants must be willing to accept a specific\n\nform of payment before consumers will use it. Conversely, a substantial number of consumers\nmust use that form of payment before merchants will consider installing atry necessary\n\nequipment or software. In this situation, a rrew product or network might not develop because, at\nthe individual level where such choices are made, neither consumers nor businesses have an\n\n\f4\n\nincentive to use the product. Both sides, however, might benefit if such a product was in place.\nSuch externalities, in which individual benefits or costs do not coincide with those accruing to\n\nsociety, can justify a public sector role in providing the service.\nSimilarly, there are possible externalities related to coordmation. Situations arise in\n\npayments markets where coordination among participants benefits both participants and users —\n\nfor example, adoption of uniform standards or a conunon technology. But agreements around\ncommon standards or technology are difficult to achieve because participants vary in size and\n\npreferences. In addition there can be a “free-rider” problem, where those that stay outside the\nprocess avoid cost associated with any agreement that might be made. The result is an\nunderprovision of services or products. One especially important example is the potential\n\n“underinvestment” in payments security by the private sector, for example, the continued use of\n\nmagnetic ship authentication for credit cards rather than more secure smart card authentication.\n\nThese externalities help explain the Federal Reserve’s traditional role in retail payments,\nespecially its role as operator in check processing and ACH. Its early check processing\ninvolvement was largely a response to the fragmented nature of the industry as payments carried\nacross literally thousands of commercial banks dispersed across a wide geographic area. Non­\n\npar- clearing was the norm, and remote locations were inadequately served. Under such\ncircumstances, it took only a few years for the Federal Reserve System to be involved in roughly\n\n50 percent of the value cleared through clearinghouses. By entering the market and ultimately\nbecoming a prominent participant, the Fed was, in effect, addressing coordination difficulties and\n\nnetwork effects. Similarly, it was instrumental in the 1950s and 1960s itr working with industry\nparticipants to establish the MICR standard and to develop high-speed sorting equipment.\n\n\f5\n\nWith regard to ACH, in the 1970s, the Federal Reserve assumed a leadership role in\npromo ting this technology to provide an alternative for bank-to-bank small dollar payments.\n\nPrivate sector banks, facing high startup costs and low ACH volumes, were understandably\n\nreluctant to invest in a new network. Without bank participation, there would not be consumer\n\ninvolvement. The Fed’s participation helped address this externality. It became one of the key\n\nACH operators, and for a few years following implementation of the Monetary Control Act, it\nsubsidized the ACH network. Over time, a critical mass was achieved, and today the ACH is one\n\nof the nation’s most heavily used retail payments systems.\nIn light of the trend toward greater industry concentration and the existence of important\n\npayments system externalities, the Federal Reserve should play a larger and more active role hi\n\nelectronic retail payments if it wants to promote the efficiency and integrity of the payments\nsystem. The key question is how this role should be defined. While the Federal Reserve could\n\nfocus more on regulation and oversight to achieve its mandate as many other central banks are\ndoing, I suggest that it should leverage its experience and position as an operator to achieve its\n\nobjectives.\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s role in both checks and ACH reflects a preference to\n\noperate within the market rather than as a pure regulator. We are well aware that industries can -\n\nand do - quickly develop methods to exploit any regulatory loopholes and avoid the intended\noutcome. By competing with the private sector on a level playing field, the Federal Reserve can\nencourage efficiency and integrity from an “on the ground” position.\n\nLooking forward, I also suggest that it could do so in the realm of electronic payments\nmore broadly. The Federal Reserve’s operational role will likely revolve around its ACH\n\n\f6\n\nplatform. Currently, the Federal Reserve is filling an important role in an ACH industry where\nthe Electronics Payments Network (EPN) is the only other active operator, and where the\n\nelimination of either party leaves a highly concentrated and less competitive market. While a\n\nrecent joint processing venture announced by Bank of America and Wells Fargo may spur the\nentry of a third ACH operator, economies of scale make entry difficult, especially in these times\n\nwhere capital is scarce and expensive. Without the Fed, it seems unlikely that a more competitive\nenvironment would emerge.\nACH volume has been steadily increasing in recent years with significant growth in\n\nnontraditional payments, such as Internet transactions and the conversion of paper checks to\nelectronic debits. Moreover, the volume and nature of ACH transactions have evolved to the\npoint where the ACH network is clearly of systemwide importance so that a major disruption\n\ncould have significant effects on the payments system and the broader economy.\nThus, in my view, the Federal Reserve’s future role in retail payments should be built\n\naround its current position in ACH. For example, in its operator role, the Federal Reserve could\n\naugment its ACH products and services, with the aim of enhancing competition and safety within\nthe ACH industry. An example where this is occurring is with same-day ACH settlement, which\nthe Federal Reserve recently announced it will begin to offer in the second quarter of 2010. This\nwill provide originating and receiving banks the option to accelerate the clearing and settlement\n\nof certain ACH debit payments, which will provide an earlier opportunity to identify return items\n\nand reduce risk.\n\n\f7\n\nThe Federal Reserve could also work with EPN to provide reciprocal backup services\n\nwith each other as well as with other electronic payments networks, and thereby serve as a\n“switch of last resort.” Such a role would prove invaluable in the event of serious disruptions to\n\nmajor networks, however unlikely such disruptions might be.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve could enhance competition hr payment card markets by\npositioning ACH services as an alternative to debit card payment networks. I am not suggesting\nthe Federal Reserve would issue its own cards or operate its own card network. However, the\n\nFederal Reserve could add enhancements to its ACH network, enabling it to become an\n\nalternative to running transactions over card networks. The recent development of so-called\ndecoupled debit cards provides an example of the industry making use of the ACH network in\n\nthis way.\nIn summary, as the payments system continues to evolve, the Federal Reserve’s role will\n\nneed to change. In my view, it would not be desirable for the Federal Reserve to scale back its\npresence in retail payments or even exit retail payments as some might advocate. Rather, the\n\nexistence of important externalities and increasing industry concentration suggest that the\nFederal Reserve must stay involved in retail payments. The question, then, is what form this\ninvolvement should take. Many central banks in a similar situation will likely opt to rely on a\n\nregulatory and oversight role. However, in part because of its unique history as an operator, I\n\nbelieve the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to leverage its traditional operator role to better\nenhance the integrity and efficiency of the payments system.\n\n\f"

Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNew York, NY\nMay 4, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers, or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fI am pleased to be here today to offer my perspectives on the ongoing financial turmoil.\nIn recent weeks, I have raised concerns about the policy response regarding institutions\nconsidered “too big to fail.” When events began to unfold in August 2007, U.S. policymakers\nreacted quickly to provide liquidity to markets and institutions. And, as matters deteriorated,\nthere was a further escalation of policy interventions to an extent not seen since the 1930s. Some\ninstitutions have failed, others have received sizable infusions of taxpayer funds to support their\noperations, and the functioning of some key financial markets now depends heavily on\ngovernment support. Despite these actions and some recent signs of improvement, markets\nremain under stress and the near-term outlook for the financial system and the economy remains\nuncertain.\nClearly, the magnitude, nature and scope of this financial crisis have posed significant\nchallenges for policymakers here and abroad. The weakening economy has caused financial\ndifficulties to escalate. But, in my view, the rush to respond has had negative consequences as\nwell. Without a systematic plan for addressing the crisis, policy actions have been ad hoc,\nresulting in inequitable outcomes among firms, creditors and investors that have increased\nuncertainty and undermined confidence. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the treatment of\nlarge, complex financial institutions that have been labeled as “systemically important” and “too\nbig to fail.”\nToday, I would like to place my recent discussion of the resolution of these large problem\ninstitutions in a somewhat broader context by taking a closer look at how we got into this\ndifficulty and by discussing some of the longer-run consequences of the actions being taken to\nresolve the crisis.\n\n2\n\n\fContext for the Crisis\nMany factors contributed to the financial excesses that spawned this crisis. But, at the\nroot of our problems is a collective failure of market discipline and public policy. Over the past\nthree decades, we have seen enormous growth in financial markets and institutions around the\nworld. This growth has been spurred by technological advances and financial innovation. But, it\nwas also supported by a philosophy that financial institutions and supervisors have the tools to\nmeasure and control risk while policymakers maintained an environment of stable prices and low\ninterest rates. This philosophy, moreover, led many financial institutions and investors to take\non more leverage, hold less in liquid funds, and downplay the risks of many of the new financial\ninstruments and counterparty relationships. Also, the removal of certain barriers to geographic\nand activity expansion in banking provided an additional incentive that helped pave the way for\never larger financial institutions, whose failure could have broad repercussions across the\nfinancial system and the economy.\nThis new system of finance relies more heavily on market discipline to manage risks and\nmaintain stability. But, as we have seen, there have also been factors that have served to\nundermine market discipline. These include: the increased complexity of financial instruments;\ninstitutional features that distorted incentives to take, measure and manage risks; and,\nimportantly, the view that large complex financial institutions would not be allowed to fail. I\nthink it is also fair to say that all regulators were complacent in performing their oversight\nresponsibilities in an environment of strong economic growth, low inflation and strong financial\nperformance.\nThese financial developments were supported by a very favorable macroeconomic\nenvironment, where a decline in inflation worldwide allowed central banks to maintain low\n\n3\n\n\finterest rates and ample credit availability, making debt and leverage more attractive. With these\nfavorable financial and macroeconomic developments extending over a long period of time -punctuated only occasionally by financial crises in some emerging market economies -- it is not\ntoo surprising that policymakers ignored the naysayers who warned of weaknesses in this system\nand did not develop a systematic plan for dealing with a major financial crisis such as the one we\nare currently confronting.\nCrisis Resolution\nFrom this introduction, let me now turn to my view on the resolution of large, complex\nfinancial institutions. While you may be familiar with some of my more recent remarks on the\n“too big to fail” issue, I have been concerned with this problem for some time. Previously, I\nsaid, “In a world dominated by mega financial institutions, governments could be reluctant to\nclose those that become troubled for fear of systemic effects on the financial system. To the\nextent these institutions become too big to fail, and where uninsured depositors and other\ncreditors are protected by implicit government guarantees, the consequences can be quite serious.\nIndeed, the result may be a less stable and a less efficient financial system.” I also noted that\n“recent history throughout the world suggests that “too big to fail” may be the policy of choice in\ncrisis situations, particularly when mega institutions play a large role in a country’s economy and\nfinancial markets.” I made these comments not this year, but in March 1999.1\nIn recent weeks, I have outlined a resolution framework for how we deal with the large,\nsystemically important institutions at the center of this crisis in the United States. Boiled down\nto its simplest elements, the plan would require those firms seeking government assistance to put\nthe taxpayer senior to all shareholders with the impact on managers and directors depending on\n\n1\n\n“Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” March 25, 1999.\nAvailable at: www.kansascityfed.org/home/subwebnav.cfm?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6\n\n4\n\n\fthe viability of the firm. Nonviable institutions would be allowed to fail and be placed into a\nnegotiated conservatorship or a bridge institution, with the bad assets liquidated while the\nremainder of the firm is operated under new management and reprivatized as soon as feasible.\nThis plan is similar to what was done in Sweden in the 1990s and what we did in the United\nStates with the failure of Continental Illinois in the 1980s.\nThis plan has many advantages, including that management and shareholders bear the\ncosts for their actions before taxpayer funds are committed. This process also is equitable across\nall firms; is similar to what we now do with smaller banks; and provides a definitive process for\nreducing market uncertainty. These all are important reasons we must implement this kind of\nresolution process.\nIn contrast to this suggested approach, a policy of “too big to fail” raises important issues.\nFor example, it worsens the already significant problem of moral hazard in which investors do\nnot monitor risk appropriately, assuming, correctly it would seem, that the government will bail\nthem out of financial problems. Capitalism is a process of failure and renewal, and a policy that\nundermines this process makes the financial system and our economy less efficient.\nAlso, when firms are treated as “too big to fail,” they receive an implied subsidy and a\ncompetitive advantage over other firms.\nCritics of the approach I suggest have raised three main objections. First, they argue that\nthese institutions are too large and complex, with many international linkages, to be resolved in a\ntimely manner. I agree that these resolutions would be complex. But, historical experience also\nshows that forbearance is often more costly, especially to the taxpayer, than resolving the\ninstitutions in a timely manner. Second, critics suggest the failure of one of these institutions\ncould be very disruptive and worsen the crisis, citing Lehman as an example. I am not at all\n\n5\n\n\fadvocating the approach taken with Lehman. Rather, I am arguing for a timely, managed and\norderly resolution of large, insolvent institutions, with their basic functions continuing under new\nmanagement. Third, critics suggest that government resolution of these institutions amount to\ntheir “nationalization.” I believe this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is\naimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed institutions and returning to private ownership as\nsoon as possible. This is something banking agencies have done many times before with smaller\ninstitutions and, in selected cases, with very large institutions. In many ways it is also similar to\nwhat is done during a corporate bankruptcy, but with an emphasis on ensuring continuity of\nservices.\nLonger-term Consequences\nIn the heat of a financial crisis, policymakers are in a reactive mode, especially in the\nabsence of a systematic plan to address the crisis. In this environment, it is tempting to\ndownplay the longer-term consequences of short-term decisions. But there are some significant\nimplications of the policy actions taken in this crisis that will shape the financial system and the\neconomic environment in the future. Let me conclude my remarks today with a discussion of\nsome of the longer-run consequences of the policy response to this crisis.\nOne key issue, of course, is what financial regulatory structure we want going forward if\nwe are to prevent a repeat of the current crisis on an even larger scale. While much of the\ndiscussion about regulatory reform will focus on who should be the regulator of what institution\nor activity, I believe there are two more important issues that need to be addressed. First, what\nshould be the span of regulation and the federal safety net; that is, which institutions or segments\nof the market should be covered by government guarantees and other support mechanisms?\nAlso, how should these entities be regulated to limit safety net exposure? A second key issue is\n\n6\n\n\fhow should we deal with large, systemically important financial institutions on a more\npermanent basis? In this regard, I fear that if we pour in enough public funds to see us through\nthe current crisis, we will then breathe a sigh of relief and back off from implementing any\ncomprehensive solutions to controlling the use of government guarantees and to addressing the\nproblems posed by systemically important institutions.\nIn my view, this would be a serious mistake. While a carefully constructed safety net and\na better resolution procedure for large institutions are critical, we also need to think about how to\nprevent such institutions from holding us hostage in the future. This may require breaking them\nup, limiting their activities or size, increasing capital requirements, or taking other steps to limit\nthe systemic risks they impose on the financial system.\nMore broadly, however, during this crisis we have seen an enormous extension of\ngovernment guarantees and support to institutions and markets that had not previously been\ncovered. Going forward, we must credibly convince financial markets and institutions that such\ncoverage will not be easily forthcoming in the future. A key step in accomplishing this is to take\nthe steps that I have suggested to resolve large problem institutions. If we fail to do so, we will\nsee moral hazard problems escalate far beyond their current levels, with enormous adverse\nimplications for the efficiency and stability of our financial system.\nThis crisis will also have an enormous fiscal cost that will place a large future burden on\ntaxpayers, even as we come closer to the tsunami of looming Social Security and Medicare\nobligations. Going forward, we need to ensure that managers, shareholders and creditors of\nfinancial institutions bear the full costs of their risk-taking, and I think we need to make it harder\nfor policymakers to pass these costs on to taxpayers.\n\n7\n\n\fFinally, let me comment on some of the longer-run implications of the Federal Reserve’s\nrole in the policy response to this crisis. This crisis has involved segments of the financial\nsystem that operate outside of the traditional federal safety net, which has been limited to\ndepository institutions. In fact, many of the players in this crisis would not be given access to the\ndiscount window during normal circumstances and have been subject to little in the way of\nprudential supervision. The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis in providing liquidity and\nsupport to institutions and markets outside of its traditional purview has been significant, creative\nand timely.\nHowever, in stepping outside its normal sphere of operations and making decisions about\nwhich markets and institutions to support, the Federal Reserve has also moved into creditallocation decisions which are more properly performed by the marketplace itself and by fiscal\nauthorities when necessary. These decisions have also caused the Federal Reserve to greatly\nexpand its balance sheet and have almost certainly set expectation for similar responses in any\nfuture crises. All of this will make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to quickly remove its\npolicy accommodation in the future and, thereby, will subject it to new tests of its independence\nas a monetary authority.\nConcluding Comments\nWe have expended considerable resources addressing this difficult crisis, but still, we\nhave a ways to go before markets will function effectively without government assistance. In my\nview, this process will go faster and with less ultimate cost if we take decisive steps to resolve\ninsolvent institutions in a timely manner, regardless of their size and complexity. Over the\nlonger term, we face the difficult task of redesigning our system of financial regulation to\nprovide more stability, while maintaining innovation and efficiency. This is always a difficult\n\n8\n\n\fbalance to strike, but it will be nearly impossible if we do not address the problems posed by\nlarge, complex financial institutions.\n\n9\n\n\f"

        "content": "For release on delivery\n9:30 a.in. EDT\nApril 21, 2009\n\nStatement of\nThomas M. Hoenig\n\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nbefore the\nJoint Economic Committee\n\nUnited States Congress\n\nApril 21, 2009\n\n\fMadam Chair Maloney, Vice Chair Schumer, ranking members Brady and Brownback,\n\nand members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about the issues\nsurrounding the exceptionally large financial institutions whose failure may pose systemic\nthreats to the financial system.\n\nThe United States currently faces economic turmoil related directly to a loss of\n\nconfidence in these large institutions. Although the response to the events of the past year has\ntaken on various forms, so far, we have not seen the return of confidence and transparency to\nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and investors wary of making new commitments. Until that\nfaith is restored, it is impossible for us to achieve full economic recovery.\nWhen the crisis began to unfold last year, and its full depth was not yet clear, we were\nquick to pump substantial liquidity into the system. In the world we find today, with the crisis\ncontinuing and hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs every month, it remains\n\ntempting to pour additional hinds into these institutions in hopes of a turnaround. We have taken\nthese steps instead of defining a consistent plan or addressing the core issue of how to deal with\nthese institutions that now block our path to recovery. Our actions so far risk prolonging the\n\ncrisis while increasing the cost and raising serious questions about how we eventually unwind\nthese programs without creating another financial crisis as bad or worse than the one we\n\ncurrently face.\nThese large and systemically important institutions are regularly referred to as “too big to\nfail,” but yet we all know that a free market system requires that insolvent firms, regardless of\n\ntheir size, market position or the complexity of their operations, must fail. We have been\n\nunwilling to allow this to happen to these firms, ignoring that we have an existing mechanism\n\n1\n\n\fthat can be used for Finns of all sizes and allows for their dissolution while controlling damage to\nthe broader financial system.\nThere seems to be a prevalent line of thinking that the problems we now face with these\n\ninstitutions are simply too complex for us to resolve without widespread damage to the financial\nsystem. I don’t think those who managed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the\n\nResolution Trust Corporation or the Swedish financial crisis were provided with a blueprint that\nguaranteed then success. And though I would be the first to acknowledge that the path I propose\n\nis not easy. I do not accept the idea that we have lost our ability to solve the challenges we now\n\nface.\nTills system has a proven hack record in the United States as well as abroad and it would\n\nserve us well in the current crisis. I have included hi this written testimony the text of a speech I\ndelivered recently in Tulsa, Okla., that spells out the details of how this program would work.\n\nAdditionally, I have included supplementary information including further details related to the\n\nresolution framework for large institutions; the process used to handle the 1984 failure; of\nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest financial institutions at the time of its\nfailure, and the approach Sweden took hi response to that nation’s banking crisis in the 1990s,\n\nwhich is very similar in many ways to what we face in the United States today.\nIn addition to the current turmoil, from a regulatory perspective we must also make the\nchanges necessary to protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future. For some\n\ntime, there has been an ongoing debate in the regulatory community pitting proponents of a\nbroad principles-based approach against those favoring a more rigid rules-based system that can\nbe widely understood and more readily, and evenly, enforced. The current crisis has made the\n\ncase that the rules system is our only alternative, as the principles-based approach leaves far too\n\n2\n\n\fmuch open for the discretion of the firms in question and not enough authority for the various\n\nregulatory agencies.\nAlong these same lines, this crisis has been the first real test of the Basel II capital\n\nframework, and it has failed miserably. Basel II relies on firms making their own detailed\n\nassessments of the risks they have assumed so a capital requirement can be assigned. I would\n\ndoubt any of us today would believe such a system to be desirable or even workable.\nEnforcement under Basel II relies on examiners understanding and evaluating extremely\n\ncomplex mathematical models. When it becomes clear that these models understate capital\n\nneeds, examiners often have difficulty arguing the technical merits of their views and convincing\nbank management to add capital. In many ways, Basel II provides banks with a rationale, a\n\ndefense and an opportunity for taking excessive leverage. Banks have strong competitive and\nfinancial incentives to increase leverage. Dining good times, leverage increases profitability, but\n\nit also increases risk. We have seen the broad systemic effects of excessive leverage. To limit\nsuch problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage through strict rules\nsetting minimum capital-to-asset ratios. It would be the easiest, most equitable and clear-cut way\n\nto set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for a broader range of films throughout\n\nfinancial markets.\nOne of the more troubling aspects of this crisis has been that in many ways these events\n\nhave not been unpredictable. A decade ago. I and others anticipated that the financial\nmegamergers we were seeing at that time would lead to a situation like the one we face today.\n\nAlthough we did not have any way of knowing the events that would provide the\nstimulus for this crisis, there were already concerns in 1999 that, “In a world dominated by mega\n\nfinancial institutions, governments could be reluctant to close those that become troubled for fear\n\n3\n\n\fof systemic effects on the financial system. To the extent these institutions become ‘too big to\n\nfail,’ and where uninsured depositors and other creditors are protected by implicit government\nguarantees, the consequences can be quite serious. Indeed, the result may be a less stable and a\n\nless efficient financial system.”1\nTins is clearly the result we now face, and it is even more pressing that we deal with the\nproblem at hand in a manner that brings stability and transparency back into our system for the\n\ncurrent environment or it is a certainty that this is an environment in which we will find\n\nourselves yet again.\n\n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” speech by Thomas M. Hoenig, delivered March 25,\n1999. Accessible at www.KansasCityFed.org /hoine/subwebnav.cfin?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6.\n\n4\n\n\fSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nApril 9, 2009\n\n5\n\n\fAs you all know, we are in the middle of a very serious financial crisis, and our economy\nis under significant stress. There has been much debate about how we should address these\nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that the economy will not\n\nrecover until the financial system is stabilized and credit flows improve.\nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the\n\nproblems of our largest financial institutions. It is has been a little more than a year since the first\n\nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Steams being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then,\nnumerous programs have been enacted and trillions of dollars of public funds have been\ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest institutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts,\n\nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfaction with how their money is being spent grows.\n\nIt is not surprising that the initial measines taken in tins crisis were ad hoc. The depth and\nextent of the problems were not anticipated. However, more than a year has passed and the\nchallenge that still remains is to define a plan that addresses the significant asset problems\n\nembedded hi our largest institutions. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers\n\nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with firms that many call “too big to fail.”\nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we\n\nshould deal with these large systemically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an\n\noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal say that it is unworkable. In my remarks\n\ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is\nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery.\n\n6\n\n\fPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\nFor a free market system to be successfill, firms must be allowed to fail based upon a\n\npredefined set of rales and principles that market participants can rely on when determining their\nstrategies and making decisions. This is particularly important for problem financial institutions.\nThese key principles should apply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large\n\ninternational financial conglomerate in New York City.\nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems\n\nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obvious. However, when we are in the middle of a\ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to\npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing\n\nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market system objectively discipline the firms through\n\nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to micromanage the institutions and punish those within\nreach.\n\nTins lack of confidence in the market’s remedy is most acute for our largest financial\ninstitutions, which have publically disclosed substantial losses. The question that the supervisory\n\nauthorities must answer is whether the losses are large enough to threaten the solvency of any of\nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in determining actions necessary to restoring public\n\nconfidence in our financial system.\nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what\nis best for one group. We need to make sure that when one financial firm fails, the resolution\nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial markets and the economy or make the\n\n7\n\n\fcurrent problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don't\ncreate a long-tenn fiscal burden on taxpayers.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there are not just the direct costs but, more importantly,\nlong-tenn costs to the economy and financial system. The direct cost of resolving a failed bank,\n\nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed bank’s losses, is simple to determine. However,\n\nit is much more difficult to know the costs from some of the unintended consequences. For\nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management,\n\nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions.\nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity\nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\n\nowners, managers, employees and customers. The process must be transparent and clearly stated\nso that everyone understands what to expect if they gamble with the film’s assets.\n\nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process\n\ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent,\n\nit needs to go through the resolution process with the owners losing their investment. However,\nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits\n\nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily\n\noperated as a bridge bank before either being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that\nthe banks go through the same process or else an incentive will be created for banks to take on\nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment.\n\nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works\nand what does not work. One way to do this is to look at past financial crises. Ulis is not the first\n\n8\n\n\ffinancial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what will and will not be successful by looking back\n\nat our own history with financial crises, as well as at the experiences in other countries.\n\nIdentifying the Problem\n\nWith these principles in mind, how should we go about resolving the current problems at\nour largest institutions?\n\nFirst, we must determine both the location and size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not\nbe easy. These firms are very large - the four largest bank holding companies each have more\nthan $1 hillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They\n\nhave offices around the world, and they are involved in many complex businesses. But in order\n\nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of\nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect their losses in their financial statements.\n\nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in terms of the value of its equity capital.\nWhen the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it\n\nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current\npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing\n\nliabilities, or it loses market confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n\nI would note that these are concrete definitions and not subjective conditions. I mention\nthis because it points out that the tenn “too big to fail” is a misstatement. It does not matter what\n\nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these\ndefinitions, it has failed.\n\n9\n\n\fOnce we determine a bank's status, we would classify these institutions into three\ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as\n\nan ongoing concern.\nThe first category would be firms whose operations are strong and whose equity remains\n\nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.\n\nSome might need to raise additional capital to provide a greater cushion against the losses they\nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these institutions are basically sound and should be able\nto raise private capital.\n\nThe second categoiy would be those institutions whose equity temporarily falls below\nminimum requirements but are expected to recover in a reasonable period of time as economic\n\nconditions improve. These films have generally sound management, who may have made some\nmistakes and suffered greater losses than normal due to the economic downturn. It is reasonable\n\nto expect these banks to raise additional private capital. However, the government may need to\nprovide some capital in the form of preferred shares and possibly some warrants in return. As an\n\nequity holder, the government would have an oversight role regarding the films’ operations and\n\nactivities.\nThe final categoiy is for the institutions that are no longer viable either because of\nliquidity problems or their equity capital is currently negative or it is likely to become negative,\n\nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which\nwould likely soon become equity insolvent without government protections and guarantees,\n\nwould be declared insolvent by the regulatory authority. Shareholders would be forced to bear\nthe full cost of the positions they have taken and risk losing their investment. Senior management\n\nand the board of directors would be replaced because they are responsible for the failed strategy.\n\n10\n\n\fA Resolution Process\nThe question then becomes how to resolve these failed institutions while minimizing the\ncost and disruption to the economy.\n\nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an\nassumption of its liabilities by another institution. For these extremely large firms, there are a\ncouple of significant roadblocks preventing this solution. First, the acquiring firm must have the\n\ncapacity for the acquisition, which means it would have to be in the same size range as the failed\ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forged, it would create an even larger firm with\n\ngreater systemic risks to the economy.\nInstead, an extremely large firm that has failed would have to be temporarily operated as\na conservatorship or a bridge organization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically\nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital without a change in the film's ownership and\n\nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future.\nExperience shows that this approach has worked. The best example was with the failure\n\nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company in 1984. Because we are in\nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental's problems began with some bad loans it purchased\n\nfrom Oklahoma City’s Perm Square Bank. As an officer in our Bank's regulatory function at that\n\ntime, I was directly involved in the closing of Penn Square. In fact, from 1982 to 1992, 347\nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance hi the Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was\n\ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tragedies. I tell you this to make\nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or\n\n11\n\n\fpainless. But the process that worked for Continental Illinois is a viable approach to addressing\nimportant aspects of today’s crisis.\nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 billion in assets and was the\n\nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- largest bank in the United\nStates. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and\n\ninternational correspondent relationships, and a separate function for making residential and\ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.\n\nWhen Continental failed, its top management and directors were replaced with\n\nindividuals who had experience operating large, complex organizations. John Swearingen,\nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding company, and William\nOgden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO.\nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of\n\nContinental’s balance sheet and placed them hr a separate work-out unit to recover as much of\nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those bad assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at\nthe time of the transaction.\nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continental’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in\n\ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock\n\nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in\nContinental.\nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants to purchase the remaining common stock for\n\nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001). If at the end of five years, the cost of the resolution was\nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise 100 percent of the warrants; if losses were\n\nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be in proportion to the amount of the losses.\n\n12\n\n\fTo economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation unit\n\nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel, hired specialists and Continental employees\nunder incentive contracts.\n\nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of\nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the wanants so the shareholders in Continental's\nholding company effectively lost their entire investment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred\nshares and shares from exercising the wanants for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200\n\nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in dividends. The ultimate resolution cost to the\nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental's assets at the time of resolution.\nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically\nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as\n\nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait for new authority. We can act immediately, using\nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.\n\nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution\ncould be created within the institution so essential sendees and operations would continue as\nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provide capital in exchange for preferred shares\n\nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government\nwanants to purchase all outstanding shares with the amount exercised determined by the\ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior management and directors would be replaced.\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is\n\nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing\nobligations would be addressed and dealt with according to the covenants and contractual\n\npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insured creditors would have immediate access to their\n\n13\n\n\ffunds, while other creditors would have immediate access to maturing funds with the potential\nfor haircuts, depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market\n\nimpact. However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm\ninsolvent.\n\nRegardless of how the firm is resolved, short-term liabilities in particular would need to\nbe addressed immediately because of their importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment\nobligations and operational needs. Quick decisions should also be made on all counterparty\n\narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the\ncounterparties.\nAuthorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically, whether the losses\n\nassociated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in financial markets and serious\n\nfunding problems that would threaten the viability of other financial firms. If so, it may be\nnecessaiy to honor all counterparty arrangements and/or short-term liabilities, as we did with\n\nContinental Illinois.\nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.\nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as\n\nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, requiring approval by two-thirds of the Federal\nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation\n\nwith the president.\n\nAs much as I dislike extending government guarantees and thereby reducing market\ndiscipline, if we were to implement this exception, I believe we would also need to extend the\n\n14\n\n\fsame guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive\n\nadvantage.\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance\nsheet of the failed institution at realistic market values and placed in an asset management\n\ncompany, resulting hi two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n\nAlternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.\nAfter writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the “good bank” with enough\n\ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to private investors for\n\nreprivatization. Any recoveries horn the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of\nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical. When a bank has a large share of\nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they are left on the balance sheet, even if they\n\nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not\n\nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition\n\nand diverts management's attention from the business objectives necessary for recovery. The\nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the future, gaining new customers and expanding\n\noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” must be on getting rid of customers and winding\n\ndown the operations.\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to determine the advisability of\nbreaking up or selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible, especially\n\ngiven the market discipline problems we have encountered with institutions regarded as “too big\n\nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and viability of large, complex financial firms is\n\n15\n\n\fdifficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex\n\nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too\nbig and too complex an institution.\n\nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.\nAt the start of the TARP I program. $125 billion was provided to the nine largest\n\nfinancial firms without an in-depth, thorough exam of their condition. However, all other banks\nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator concluded they were strong enough to\n\nweather the crisis and continue as an ongoing concern.\nThe $10 per share that Bear Steams' stockholders received from the JPMorgan Chase\nacquisition would not have been possible without the government’ s guarantee of $29 billion of\n\nproblem assets. Additionally, the government has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s\ncontinued operations, with their shareholders standing to reap financial gain if AIG ultimately\n\nrecovers.\nMeanwhile. 46 banks in the United States have failed since the beginning of 2008. All of\n\nthem were resolved through one of the bank resolution problems I have discussed here today.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n\nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it\nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere.\nThe economic situation in Sweden hi the early 1990s was similar to that in the United\nStates today. Its financial system was dominated by six large banks that accounted for 90\npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major\n\nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through\n\n16\n\n\fprivate sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off\n\ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to systematically\nrestore confidence in its financial system, and although it took several years to work down and\nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it only dealt\nwith only six banks, hi addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less complex,\nand that the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead\nof the complex financial assets, structured securities and derivatives that we would have to work\nout today.\n\nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has\nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory\n\nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is likely that few would require further government\nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real estate assets involve\n\nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives.\n\nAnother import ant example is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a\n\nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining problem banks and writing\ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values, making any needed and appropriate changes in\nbank management, injecting public equity as needed into these banks, and returning the banks to\nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be highly successfill in recapitalizing banks, and like\n\nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to taxpayers. More detailed information on both the\n\nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a\ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at KansasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation\n\n17\n\n\fof why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be usefill to provide more details\naround my view that it can be done.\n\nLet me make two final points.\n\nFirst, the debate over the resolution of the largest financial firms is often sensationalized\nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing failed institutions. It is also pointed out that\n\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\nIn response, I would note that no firm would be nationalized in this program.\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the intent of\n\noperating it. Though a bridge institution is the most likely outcome when a large financial firm\nfails, the goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, hi addition, subject to\n\nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge film would be managed by private sector managers\nselected for their experience in operating well-run, large, complex organizations.\n\nThe second point is related to the complexity issue, which is that it would be hard to find\n\nenough people with the required knowledge, experience and skills to fill the open positions.\nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we were able to do it then. More generally: The\n\nUnited States is a vast country with a tremendous amount of management resources in a broad­\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have the talent to run these\nTurns, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion.\n\n18\n\n\fMATERIALS REFERENCED IN THE SPEECH:\n\nSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE\n\n•\n\nA Resolution Process for Financial Filins\n\n•\n\nAssistance for Continental Illinois\n\n•\n\nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis\n\n•\n\nReferences\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nApril 9, 2009\n\n19\n\n\fA Resolution Process for Financial Firms\n\n•\n\nThe United States is hi the middle of a serious financial crisis, and the economy is under\nsignificant stress. While there has been a lot of debate about how to revive the economy and\nrestore financial stability, there is broad agreement that the economy will not recover until\nthe financial system is stabilized and credit starts flowing more normally.\n\n•\n\nThe recovery of the financial system depends critically on the public regaining trust and\nconfidence hr financial institutions, particularly the largest financial institutions. The public’s\nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken,\nthe poor management of those risks and the resulting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal\nfinancial market activity depends importantly on how the problems of the largest bank and\nnonbank financial institutions are addressed.\n\n•\n\nDespite the best of intentions, the policies and actions directed at restoring the health of the\nfinancial system have not been consistent or transparent. It is understandable that the initial\nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because the depth and breadth of the problems were\nnot expected and there were no plans in place for addressing the problems.\n\n•\n\nThe solution must be a clear and fair plan so that financial firms, investors and consumers\nknow what to expect when any financial institution runs into problems. Specifically, the plan\nmust provide a process for how policymakers will address the deterioration of the financial\ncondition of all financial firms, regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become\ninsolvent.\n\n•\n\nA resolution process is particularly important for the largest, most complex and\ninterconnected institutions because they have been considered by many as “too big to fail,” at\nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution process that can be used for any\nfinancial film involved in the intermediation process or payments system, but the focus is on\nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too\nbig to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the best solution for the economy.\n\nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\n•\n\nA free market system requires that busmess owners capture the profits from their successes\nand bear the costs of their failures. Finns that meet the market test will grow, while those that\ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowed to go out of business if they fail. The\nconsequences of failure and the resolution framework must be clearly stated and transparent\nso that business owners have clear expectations about the consequences of their actions.\n\n•\n\nThe resolution framework must prescribe a predefined set of rules, guided by an agreed upon\nset of principles. This is particularly important for financial institutions, big or small, because\ntheir success depends critically on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable,\nongoing concern.\n\n20\n\n\f•\n\nThere are two key principles that the resolution process should follow.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the resolution process should minimize the cost to the overall economy.\n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant\nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems.\n- The process should minimize the cost of resolving an insolvency to avoid a long-term\nfiscal burden on taxpayers.\n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and\nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.\n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, such as the government bearing some of the\nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.\n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly\nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.\n- To minimize the future cost to the economy, the resolution process must not create\nadverse incentives that are inconsistent with economic efficiency. Specifically, the\nresolution process must not allow a film’s management, shareholders and creditors to\navoid the consequences of then mistakes because it reduces market discipline, creates\nadverse incentives for firms to take too much risk, and inefficiently directs resources and\nfinancial capital to less-productive uses.\n- The process must be transparent and clearly stated so that everyone understands what to\nexpect and the consequences of their actions. Management must know beforehand what\nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant,\nnegative effect on the firm’s financial condition.\n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution process should be based on solid research and\ninformation about what works and what does not work. Policymakers can learn a lot\nabout what will and will not be successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial\ncrises, as well as at crises in other countries.\n\n•\n\nThe second principle is the resolution process must be equitable in that it is the same for all\nfinancial films regardless of size or location, although it is possible that the outcome will\ndiffer.\n- The resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\nowners, managers, employees and customers, regardless of the institution’s size,\ncomplexity or location.\n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the difference between process\nand outcome.\n- For example, if a bank is examined and found to be insolvent, the bank should go through\nthe resolution process and the owners should lose their investment regardless of the\nbank’s size. The outcome may be that a relatively small bank is resolved by another\ninstitution purchasing its assets and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is\ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank.\n- In both cases, the banks go through the same process of being declared insolvent and the\nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.\n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risks just to grow to a size large enough to\nreceive favorable treatment, and customers may choose to go with a large bank instead of\na small bank.\n21\n\n\fOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution\n\n•\n\nThere are several options for resolving a failed film, but it is important to first define\ninsolvency.\n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its common equity capital is negative - that is, the\nfilm’s outstanding liabilities owed to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets.\n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a positive amount of equity capital, is not viable\nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current payment obligations, either\nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses\nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n- It is important to note that these are definitions of insolvency and are not subjective\nconditions, which points out that the teim “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It\ndoes not matter what size a firm is - if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.\n\n•\n\nThe question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?\n\n•\n\nOne option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to maintain ongoing operations\nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment\nobligations.\n- In this case, no tiling is actually resolved, and the insolvent film is essentially bailed out\nso that it can continue normal operations.\n- This option may be used for a large financial film that is considered “too big to fail”\nbecause of concerns that it is systemically important, in the sense that other resolution\nmethods would have large, negative spillover effects on economy.\n- Under this option, the teim “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve”\nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and\nfinancial system.\n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; current shareholders do not\nlose their investment, although the government may impose some restrictions on the\nfilm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses.\n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of the first principle of minimizing costs.\n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not\nimmediately cause further problems, it sets the stage for significant future problems. In a\nbailout, senior management, directors and current shareholders stand to reap any gains\nthat may result, which weakens market discipline and creates the moral hazard that the\nfirm will take too much risk.\n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and\nnot for smaller films that are not expected to cause spillover effects if other resolution\nmethods are used.\n\n•\n\nAlternatively, bank regulators have for years used a variety of options to resolve insolvent\nbanks. These options include:\n- liquidation,\n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s assets and assumption of its liabilities by another\ninstitution,\n\n22\n\n\f- or operating the bank for a short period of time through open-bank assistance or as a\nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of\nprivate investors.\n\n•\n\nWhen most people think of a firm as failing, they generally think the firm is shut down and\nliquidated.\n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed as a receiver and it pays off insured\ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit.\n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid partial amounts based on expected recoveries.\n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets by selling them or holding on to them and\nworking them out. The proceeds from the assets are used to first pay remaining amounts\nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecured creditors, and if anything is left over,\nto shareholders.\n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they\nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts.\n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard,\nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and\ntherefore is the least desirable choice.\n- Tins option is disruptive for individuals and business customers because they tend to hold\nshort-term instruments, such as deposits and commercial paper, for making payments or\nas a temporary way of storing their funds. Many bus mess customers also have\ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when\nthe bank is liquidated.\n\n•\n\nThe resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumption (P&A) transaction,\nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another bank to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and\nassume its liabilities.\n- In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution\nmethod because the FDIC may receive a premium from the acquiring bank. And even if\nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assume the liabilities, it is often less costly\nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquidate the failed bank’s\nassets.\n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy.\n- Short-term creditors and counterparties have immediate access to all insured deposits and\nat least a large portion of uninsur ed obligations, while borrowers continue to have access\nto credit.\n- In addition, because management and directors are replaced and shareholders lose their\ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not reduce market discipline or create adverse\nincentives for bank management and shareholders.\n\n•\n\nWhile a P&A transaction is often the best option for most failed banks, it generally is not the\nbest option if one of the largest financial institutions fails because it creates even larger\ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.\n- A major difficulty in the current financial crisis has been that some institutions are so\nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no\nmatter what option is used.\n\n23\n\n\f- Only another institution in the same size range would have the capacity and resources to\npinchase the assets and assume the liabilities of another large institution.\n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been several examples of large institutions taking\nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if institutions can get “too\nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, the resolution process should not result in even\nlarger institutions.\n\n•\n\nThe final option, which is the most feasible for a large, complex financial institution that\nfails, is to run it temporarily as a conservatorship or bridge organization.\n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy.\n- Tins option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to\nconduct the necessary due diligence.\n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible.\n- As will be discussed below, management, shareholders and creditors would be forced to\nbear the frill cost of their actions and positions they have taken to maintain market\ndiscipline and economic efficiency.\n\n•\n\nOne of the difficulties with all of these options is that while there are time-tested, fast\nresolution processes in place for depository institutions, today’s largest financial institutions\nare conglomerate financial holding companies with many financial subsidiaries that are not\nbanks.\n- The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option\nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bankruptcy process.\n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete - sometimes years - which\nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it can continue normal operations while in\nbankruptcy.\n- It does not work for financial firms, however, because they have a variety of complex,\nshort-term liabilities and counterparty arrangements that customers depend on for\nmaintaining daily operations. A long, drawn-out bankruptcy proceeding would prevent\ncustomers and counterparties from having access to then funds, which would cause\nsignificant economic disruptions.\n- In addition, the cornerstone of a financial institution’s franchise value is trust in its\nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sine to quickly erode in a long, drawnout bankruptcy proceeding.\n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding companies quickly and in a way that minimizes\nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a\nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.\n\n•\n\nEnacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the\nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and should act immediately to\nresolve a large financial company should one fail.\n\n24\n\n\fA Proposed Resolution Process\n•\n\nHie resolution process discussed below is applicable to any financial firm that is part of the\nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the\nfocus is on systemically important financial institutions that are found to be insolvent.\n\n•\n\nTo prevent systemic disruptions to the economy, a failed institution should be allowed to\ncontinue its operations through a bridge institution or conservatorship so that all essential\nservices and operations would go on as normal.\n- Because the firm is insolvent, it would need additional capital to continue operating.\n- To recapitalize the firm, the government could provide the capital in exchange for\npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.\n\n•\n\nhi general, the supervisory authorities would not have the authority to declare the institution\ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management and shareholders bear the costs of their actions\nand investment decisions, the government’s investment would be conditional on:\n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure.\n- Existing shareholders providing the government warrants to purchase all outstanding\nshares, with the amount exercised determined by the net costs of resolving the firm.\n- While share holders may be reluctant to agree to these conditions, in most cases, they\nwould have little choice given the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance.\n\n•\n\nThe specific steps to be taken would depend on several factors, such as the type of financial\norganization and the supervisor’s existing legal authority.\n■ For example, if a holding company’s primary asset is an insured bank and the bank and\nholding company become insolvent, the bank could be closed and the FDIC could set up\na bridge bank.\n■ In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervisory authorities could\ntake actions to mitigate the impact on the rest of the economy.\n\n•\n\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is how\nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.\n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing obligations would be addressed and dealt with\naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.\n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would\nhave immediate access to maturing funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on\nexpected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market impact.\n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there's a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial\nfirm insolvent.\n\n•\n\nRegardless of how the film is resolved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors\nwill be treated.\n- Short-term liabilities in particular would need to be addressed immediately because of\ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment obligations and operations\nneeds.\n\n25\n\n\f- Quick decisions also need to be made on all counterparty arrangements because of the\nwidespread impact that uncertainty about their status or default would have on their\ncounterparties.\n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of their decisions and market discipline is\nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in\nline behind more senior creditors as the claims on the bank are resolved.\n- However, the authorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically,\nwhether the losses associated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in\nfinancial markets and serious funding problems that would threaten the viability of other\nfinancial firms.\n\n•\n\nhi a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short­\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prevent a systemic disruption to the\neconomy.\n- However, this guarantee should be considered as a “systemic” exception to the normal\nprocess.\n- To limit the use of this exception to truly systemic situations, Congress should enact an\napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991\nFDIC Improvement Act.\n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds\nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the president.\n- In addition, though the extension of government guarantees and the resulting reduction in\nmarket discipline should generally be avoided, extension of the same guarantees would\nneed to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed institutions would have a\ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of\nequitable treatment.\n\n•\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is the bad assets need to be taken off the balance sheet of\nthe failed institution at realistic market values.\n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting\nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work\nthem out.\n- After writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the good bank with\nenough capital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to\nprivate investors for eventual reprivatization.\n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of tire\ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\n•\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forward-looking process for recovery\nand the eventual reprivatization of the good bank.\n- When a bank has a large share of nonperfonning assets, they remain a burden when they\nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.\n- For example, they still have to be funded even though they are not producing income,\nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition, and they divert a lot of\n26\n\n\fmanagement’s attention from more productive activities for the future growth and\nprofitability of the bank.\n- In addition, the business objectives and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and\nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills\nfor running an ongoing financial firm.\n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand\noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is to get rid of customers and wind down the\noperations.\n\n•\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory authorities should consider breaking up\nor selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible.\n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market\ndiscipline problems.\n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication that it is too large and\ncomplex to manage well.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n•\n\nA variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest financial firms fail. These\nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However,\nthe resolution process being advocated here has a record of success elsewhere.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the proposed resolution process is exactly what the Swedes did to solve an equally\nsevere banking crisis that they had hi the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to\n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed description of the Swedish crisis and resolution\nprocess).\n■ The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was\ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.\n■ Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial institutions.\n■ The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and\npublic authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off then- bad\nassets to be managed within a separate entity.\n■ Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its financial system, and although it took\nseveral years to work down and sell off all of the bad assets, there was essentially no net\ncost to the taxpayers.\n■ Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were\nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors\nand other unsecured creditors.\n\n•\n\nSome people do not think that the Swedish situation is a valid comparison because it dealt\nwith only six banks. In addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less\ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans,\nnot the complex financial assets, such as structured securities and derivatives, that would\nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail. While these\nconcerns are valid, it should be noted that:\n\n27\n\n\f- Although the United States has several thousand banks, only 19 banks have more than\n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is\nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.\n- It is actually very difficult to work out problems on real estate assets, and it is not\nnecessarily more difficult to work out even complex securities.\n\n•\n\nAs an aside, an additional lesson that can be learned from Sweden is that a resolution process\nis much more likely to succeed if it has broad political support and is structured to be\nindependent of the political process.\no The plan should be put largely under the control of in dependent supervisory agencies.\no Political involvement should be confined largely to specifying the program’s goals and\nbasic rules.\no The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the\nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces the need for political involvement.\n\n•\n\nA second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstruction Finance Corporation\n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s.\n- The RFC began by examining problem banks and writing down the bad assets to realistic\neconomic values.\n- It then made any needed and appropriate changes in bank management and provided\npublic equity capital as needed.\n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its\ncosts.\n\n•\n\nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company\nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution\nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed process, hi addition, it is an\nexample of a resolution of a large, complex, interconnected holding company.\n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial and industrial lender and the\nseventh- largest U.S. bank. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a\nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent relationships, and a separate\nfunction for making residential and commercial real estate loans. It also provided\nspecialized services to a variety of companies.\n- The attached document, “Assistance for Continental Illinois,” provides details about the\nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company.\n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the\nholding company shareholders lost their entire investment, and the bank was restored to\nsound condition and returned to private ownership.\n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns\nabout the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors and other\nunsecured creditors.\n\nAnother concern that has been raised about letting the largest financial films fail is that it\nnationalizes these institutions. As part of this concern, it is also often pointed out that\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\n■ In the proposed process, no firm would be nationalized.\n\n28\n\n\f■\n■\n\n■\n\n•\n\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the\nintent of continued ownership.\nThough a bridge institution is the most likely outcome for a large financial firm that fails,\nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, subject to the\ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.\nIn addition, subject to regulatory agency oversight, the bridge firm would be managed by\nprivate sector managers selected for their experience in operating well-run, large,\ncomplex organizations.\n\nSome opponents to the proposed process also claim it would be very difficult to take over\nthese firms and bring in new management because they are too complex to manage, as well\nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, and skills to fill the\nopen positions.\no The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with\nexperience running large, complex organizations.\no In addition, while the institution might be complex, a new management team is clearly\nbetter than leaving the institution under the control of the management team that caused it\nto fail in the first place.\no More generally, it is hard to believe that there is not enough talent, either from the United\nStates or other countries, to run these organizations.\n\n29\n\n\fAssistance for Continental Illinois\nI.\n\nProblems at Continental Illinois\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nII.\n\nInterim Financial Assistance\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIII.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continental Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid\ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lending, that was largely funded\nby purchased money.\nIt became the seventh-largest U.S. bank and largest commercial lender in the United\nStates.\nPeim Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy\nmarkets led to declining asset quality and earnings at Continental from 1982 into\n1984 and forced Continental to rely heavily on foreign money markets for funding.\nNews stories in May 1984 on Continental’s problems started a run by foreign\ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, they had withdrawn more than $6 billion.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago began lending through the discount window to\ncover the lost deposits, and Continental put together a $4.5 billion loan package\nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.\n\nOn May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Federal Reserve announced an interim\nassistance package for Continental, which was based on the FDIC’s open bank\nassistance authority.\nThe FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at Continental in order to keep a liquidity\ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks, prevent significant losses at tire many banks\nthat had correspondent accounts at Continental and avoid other negative effects in\nU.S. financial markets.\nA $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest­\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FDIC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining\n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks.\nThe Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liquidity needs of Continental, and a group\nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to provide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an\nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed.\nThe FDIC was unable to find any merger partners for Continental during this interim\nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s asset problems, substantial litigation and\nfunding issues, along with the limited number of merger partners under Illinois’\ninterstate banking restrictions.\n\nPermanent Financial Assistance\n\n- In July 1984, a permanent assistance plan was put in place for Continental.\n\n30\n\n\f- Continental’s top management and board of directors were removed. John\nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding\ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manilattan, became\nCEO of the bank.\n- The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Continental’s discount window borrowings from\nthe Federal Reserve.\n- In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book\nvalue) of assets from Continental. This consisted of poor quality loans that\nContinental had already written down to $3 billion (these loans were further written\ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and Continental was forced to take a charge of\n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continental for $1.5 billion, which\nContinental could repay within tlnee years by giving the FDIC additional loans of\nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion.\n- To offset the $1 billion charge to Continental’s capital that was required by the loan\nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capital into Continental. Tire FDIC’s capital\ninfusion consisted of $720 million of permanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior\nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9\npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of\npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative preferred stock in the holding company. This\nassistance was provided through the holding company rather than the bank because\ncovenants in the holding company’s debt instruments required debtholder approval to\nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it.\n- The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it for any losses, carrying\ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired.\n- The $2 billion in subordinated notes issued Under the interim plan was repaid.\n- To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation\ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel, Continental employees under incentive\ncontracts and hired specialists.\n\nTV.\n\nReturn to Private Ownership and the Cost of Resolving Continental Illinois\n- In a series of sales that took place between December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC\nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option.\n- The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their entire investment once\nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as compensation for loan liquidation losses.\n- From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private\nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital\ninvestment, and it also received more than $200 million in dividends on tills stock.\n- Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion,\nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets at the time of resolution.\n- Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.\n\n31\n\n\fSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis\n• Economic and financial market conditions leading up to the Swedish banking crisis were\nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis.\n- Deregulation of financial markets (elimination of quantitative controls on bank lending,\nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on capital flows) is similar to recent deregulation\n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial innovations (securitization, derivatives).\n- Large inflow of foreign capital and expansion of domestic lending and debt.\n- Low/negative real interest rates.\n- Strong growth in consumption and real estate investment and low savings rate.\n- Sharp increases in asset prices (stocks and real estate).\n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real\ninterest rates, the impact on the economy was similar to the current crisis.\n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (tangible asset values fell about 30 percent).\n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankruptcies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and\n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively).\n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from being slightly negative at the end of the\n1980s to 8 percent in 1993.\n- Residential real estate hivestment froze.\n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan - temporary government investment in banks\nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically\nfeasible.\n• Political support - the program had broad political support, which was important for quick\ndecisive actions and providing the national leadership necessary for public support.\n• Political independence - a Bank Support Authority, separate from the financial supervisory\nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the\nprogram. The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from\npolitical interference in making decisions, although the BSA worked closely with the\nsupervisory authority and central bank.\n• Debt guarantees\n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other creditors were frilly protected from future\nlosses, including foreign creditors (accounted for about 40 percent of bank funding).\n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed\ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the\ncrisis).\n• Transparency\n- The government was very open about the process.\n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and\nrealistic asset values, and asset values that had declined were promptly written down.\n• Bank recapitalization\n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject\nto various economic scenarios. Banks were placed in one of three categories based on their\nviability in the worst-case scenario, which determined the type of government support they\nwould receive.\n- Categoiy 1 - Capital deteriorates but remains above minimum requirements.\n32\n\n\f•\n\n•\n\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe bank was expected to raise additional capital, with temporary government guarantees\navailable if necessary to help maintain public confidence.\n- Category 2 - Capital falls below minimum requirements but is expected to rise above the\nminimum in a reasonable period of time.\nShareholders were expected to contribute additional capital, with the government\ncontributing capital as necessary to meet opera ting requirements. Government received\npreferred shares.\n- Category 3 - Capital becomes negative and bank is unlikely to become profitable.\nBank declared insolvent and government resolves the bank in the least-costly manner,\nincluding the possibility of liquidation.\nGood bank, bad bank model - used for banks that received government support and for\ninsolvent banks. Nonperforming loans were transferred to work-out companies at realistic\nmarket values. The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound\noperations and managed by financial market professionals with clear business objectives.\nShareholders were not protected (except for one bank in which the government was the\nmajority shareholder, as noted below).\n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares.\n- The government also received voting power that would grow over time, so the government\nwould eventually become the majority shareholder if the support was large enough and\nmaintained for a long period of time.\nBanks that received assistance were given conditions to make operational improvements.\nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance.\nResults\n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Category 2) received government capital (the\ngovernment was already the majority shareholder and it also purchased the outstanding\nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and\neventually merged with Nordbanken; and Sparbanken received a government loan.\n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely\nintact - there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.\n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent\nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke even, which is based on\ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale\nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proceeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross\nfiscal cost of the support program is estimated to have been about 4 percent of GDP.\n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized and is now part of Nordea (the government\nowns about 20 percent), which operates hi Sweden, Norway, Finland and Demnark.\nLessons learned\n- Political consensus on a support plan is crucial.\n- Once the plan is folined and implemented, it is just as important for the process to be\nindependent of political interference and fully transparent to the public.\n- The government officials hr charge of the program must take timely and decisive actions\nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political independence is important.\n- Assets must be given realistic valuations.\n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose their investment, and senior management and the\nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes. Markets will\nnot be efficient unless those who may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs\n\n33\n\n\fwhen those actions lead to losses, and equitable treatment requires that the same Riles\napply to all firms regardless of size.\nThe program’s success also requires that the new management of the good and bad banks\nare financial industry professionals, are given sound business objectives and clearly\nunderstand to whom they are responsible, which is another reason why political\nindependence is important.\n\n34\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\nDavison, Lee. “Continental Illinois and ‘Too Big to Fail/” History of the Eighties, Lessons for\nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s, Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.\nEnglund, Peter. “The Swedish Banking Crisis: Roots and Consequences,” Oxford Review of\nEconomic Policy, Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 80-97.\nErgungor, O.

Hoeing\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Community Affairs Research Conference\nWashington, DC\nApril 17,2009\n\n\fOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, along with our planning partners at\nthe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and San Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors, I would like to welcome you to the second day of this conference and thank you for\n\nyour participation.\n\nAlthough the topics to be discussed here are always of extreme importance, the current\n\nenvironment gives our discussion added urgency. Though we are all being affected by the humoil\nin our economy, the underserved are especially vulnerable. Their safety net may be extremely\n\nlimited, if it exists at all. Meanwhile, they are often the fust to suffer during an economic\n\ndownturn and the last to recover.\n\nAs you all know, there are many reasons why it is important that consumers have access to\nfinancial products and the knowledge to use them safely. In addition to what it does for the\nindividual or family, it is also important for tire nation’s collective well-being that consumers at all\nlevels are able to make wise decisions with their finances in a manner that best suits their needs.\n\nWith this in mind, the regional Federal Reserve Banks have taken a number of steps\nfocused on these issues within the communities they serve. It is well-known that the 12 Reserve\nBanks, along with their branches, play an important role in giving the Federal Reserve a truly\nnational perspective on issues related to monetary policy and banking. But they also conduct\n\nimportant research to help the Federal Reserve and others understand the underlying issues for\nthose with low incomes and those who are underserved in the area of financial services, hi\nDecember of 2007, the Fed convened staff from its research, supervision and community affair s\nareas to identify the state of knowledge concerning mortgage markets in the current environment.\n\nThis effort identified knowledge gaps to be addressed through research and outlined strategies to\nhelp individuals and communities respond to the financial crisis.\n\n2\n\n\fWe have integrated the research with public programs where our regional Reserve Banks\nare taking on an increasingly prominent role. Where once our public programs were focused\n\nprimarily on providing information to broad groups of constituencies, we are now engaged largely\n\nin technical and capacity building efforts with defined stakeholders.\nTlu'oughout the System, each Bank has developed unique programs to meet the identified\n\nneeds within its District, and by doing so has strengthened the learning, innovation and\neffectiveness of the System’s overall response. This is one of the real strengths of our System.\n\nBecause the Reserve Banks are regional institutions, we are able to foster local partnerships and\noffer local expertise to the conununities of our respective Districts.\nAlthough these programs are created at the individual Bank level to serve a local need, in\n\nalmost all instances they provide a template that can be, and often is, replicated by the other\n\nBanks, expanding the reach and success rate of our best and most beneficial programs. These\n\nefforts allow us to be more nimble and proactive in responding to common problems.\nWith my remaining time I would like to highlight and recognize some of our more\n\ninnovative responses to tire financial crisis.\n\nForeclosure mitigation/housing\nUnderstandably, our programs related to foreclosures and foreclosure mitigation have\nexpanded significantly and are our primary focus. In 2008, the Conununity Affairs functions\nacross the System sponsored three times as many events related to foreclosure as a year earlier.\n\nWe have brought together diverse groups such as developers, realtors, lenders and servicers to\n\nfoster a common understanding and common approaches. We have made numerous presentations\nto public officials and policymakers at all levels.\nSeveral Federal Reserve Banks have worked with alliances, including HOPE NOW\n\nAlliance and NeighborWorks America, to present foreclosure prevention workshops that bring\n\n\ftogether borrowers, counselors and servicers to directly identify and address individual consumer\nproblems. Without a doubt, the most notable of these events was coordinated by the Boston Fed\n\nand held at Gillette Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots. That event, which involved\nnumerous partners including the Patriots’ charitable foundation, brought more than 2,000\n\nhomeowners facing foreclosure together with mortgage servicers. In Kansas City, where the\n\nimpact of the crisis has been slightly different, a similar event where organizers expected to help\n350 troubled borrowers ended up providing assistance to more than twice that number.\n\nAs we have seen a rise in foreclosure-related scams, the Fed has been active, working with\nNeighborWorks America on a public service campaign to raise awareness about the issue. We\nhave also created an innovative series of ads developed by the Board of Governors that will be\nshown in movie theaters, much like motion-picture trailers, in targeted communities where we are\n\nfinding the problem is prevalent.\nWe have established Web-based Foreclosure Resource Centers on each of the 12 Federal\nReserve Banks’ websites to help address local and regional challenges in mortgage markets and\n\nlocal communities. The Foreclosure Resource Centers are customized by each Bank, based on the\nregion-specific conditions. The Board's public site includes a map linking to each of the regional\n\nforeclosure centers. For homeowners and homebuyers, the centers provide contact information for\nagencies that can help those in financial trouble or provide counsel for those who want to buy their\nfirst home. For community leaders and local municipalities, the centers offer information on\n\npreserving and protecting the neighborhoods where foreclosures have occurred. The centers also\nprovide access to Federal Reseive research and notices of upcoming events.\n\nThe Fed has published dynamic maps showing conditions and density of owner-occupied\nsubprime mortgage loans at the state, county and zip code level. The maps are based on data for\n\nowner-occupied mortgage loans that have been securitized into a product that is categorized as\nsubprime, based on the grade assigned to the security. State- and comity-level maps and data with\n4\n\n\fTransUnion credit card and mortgage delinquency rates and changes have also been added to the\n\nsite. The interactive maps provide a national source for information on foreclosure incidence with\nthe ability to drill down further into conditions at the regional level.\n\nOur Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit assists community organizations and local\ngovernments in addressing the current tunnoil in the housing market and minimizing the impact of\nforeclosures on neighborhoods. The resources in the Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit\n\nare presented as a four-step process to: 1) assess the foreclosure situation; 2) reach troubled\n\nhomeowners; 3) establish post-foreclosure support systems; and 4) stabilize neighborhoods.\nCommunity Affairs offices worked to develop best practices for creating, packaging and\n\ndistributing foreclosure crisis toolkits for smaller municipalities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve convened the Recoveiy/Renewal/Rebuilding series of conferences\n\nand seminars throughout the summer and fall of 2008. Events hosted by the Federal Reserve\nBanks of Atlanta, San Francisco, Cleveland and St. Louis were designed both to investigate ways\n\nto address the negative spillover effects of foreclosures and to help the Federal Reseive gather\ninsights on the many complex factors around foreclosure issues. After the series, a “capstone”\nevent held at the Board of Governors explored a range of policy topics and focused on emerging\n\nthemes.\nThese forums provided greater focus on the impact of the foreclosure crisis on different\n\nreal estate markets; on strategies that address both the negative impact of foreclosures in high-cost\nmarkets and the challenge of strengthening neighborhoods in weak market communities; and on\n\nhow recent research on foreclosure and vacancy and abandonment might be actualized as public\npolicy. The series also clarified the challenges and the strategies for moving toward solutions.\n\n5\n\n\fOther efforts\n\nThe area of financial education has been a longtime area of emphasis for the Federal\n\nReserve. We know there is a connection between making wise financial choices and problems\n\nsuch as foreclosure and other quality-of-life issues including the ability to gain additional\neducation or retire.\nAt the Kansas City Fed, we have looked closely at the issue of financial education in the\n\nworkplace. Not only is this an innovative way to potentially reach individuals who might\notherwise go without assistance, there may also be benefits for the employer in addition to the\nemployee.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago Fed pioneered an innovative approach to cooperatively promoting\n\nfinancial education services through its Money Smart Week initiative. While this originated prior\nto the current crisis, it has provided an important tool in highlighting resources available for\nconsumers to use in these difficult times. The Kansas City Fed has taken this model on as a tool\n\nfor strengthening and expanding access to financial education services with similar programs\n\nthroughout our District.\nAlthough education is an important component, we also know that the complexities of our\n\nfinancial system can create questions for consumers who make even the wisest financial choices.\nAlthough the system has served the nation well, consumers can be uncertain about which\n\nregulatory agency can provide assistance for particular difficulties they may encounter. A\npartnership between the Minneapolis and Kansas City Feds addresses this problem, providing a\nhotline and an online resource to help consumers with their questions about specific financial\n\nproducts and institutions.\n\nConsumers need not know which regulator is the appropriate source for assistance, but can\nhim to FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov or the related toll-free telephone number (888-8516\n\n\f1920) for a wide range of resources and assistance that can put them in touch with the appropriate\n\nregulatory authority. Call center staff members are available dining extended hours to talk with\n\nindividual consumers about specific problems and offer individualized assistance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is only a very small sampling of our Community Affairs programs. And while I am\n\nmost familiar with the programs involving the Kansas City Fed, I know I speak for all of the\nReserve Bank presidents when I say that we take much pride in the work being done by our staffs\nin this area.\n\nI think it is important to note that many of these efforts have grown from the creativity of\n\nour local Community Affairs staffs located throughout the nation, and many of the most\n\ninnovative ideas have emerged in recent months. I believe we can expect this trend to continue as\nwe look to fully utilize the regional expertise, partnerships and programs to provide national\n\nsolutions.\nI hope this conference is beneficial to you. I know it is beneficial to us, the policymakers.\n\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "EMBARGOED UNTIL NOON CT\n\nSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nApril 9, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by die author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fAs you all know, we are in the middle of a very serious financial crisis, and our economy\nis under significant stress. There has been much debate about how we should address these\nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that the economy will not\n\nrecover until the financial system is stabilized and credit flows improve.\nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the\n\nproblems of our largest financial institutions. It is has been a little more than a year since the first\n\nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Steams being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then,\nnumerous programs have been enacted and trillions of dollars of public funds have been\ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest institutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts,\n\nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfaction with how their money is being spent grows.\nIt is not surprising that the initial measures taken in this crisis were ad hoc. The depth and\n\nextent of the problems were not anticipated. However, more than a year has passed and the\nchallenge that still remains is to define a plan that addresses the significant asset problems\n\nembedded in our largest institutions. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers\n\nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with firms that many call “too big to fail.”\nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we\n\nshould deal with these large systemically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an\n\noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal say that it is unworkable, hi my remarks\ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is\n\nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery.\n\n2\n\n\fPrinciples for a Resolution Framework\n\nFor a free market system to be successfill, firms must be allowed to fail based upon a\n\npredefined set of rules and principles that market participants can rely on when determining their\nstrategies and making decisions. Tins is particularly important for problem financial institutions.\nThese key principles should apply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large\n\ninternational financial conglomerate in New York City.\nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems\n\nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obvious. However, when we are in the middle of a\ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to\npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing\n\nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market system objectively discipline the firms though\n\nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to micromanage the institutions and punish those within\nreach.\nThs lack of confidence in the market’s remedy is most acute for our largest financial\n\ninstitutions, which have publically disclosed substantial losses. The question that the supervisory\nauthorities must answer is whether the losses are large enough to threaten the solvency of any of\nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in determining actions necessary to restoring public\n\nconfidence in our financial system.\nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what\nis best for one group. We need to make sure that when one financial firm fails, the resolution\nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial markets and the economy or make the\n\n\fcurrent problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don’t\ncreate a long-term fiscal burden on taxpayers.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there are not just the direct costs but, more importantly,\nlong-term costs to the economy and financial system. The direc t cost of resolving a failed bank,\n\nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed bank’s losses, is simple to determine. However,\n\nit is much more difficult to know the costs from some of the unintended consequences. For\nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management,\n\nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions.\nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity\nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s\n\nowners, managers, employees and customers. The process must be transparent and clearly stated\nso that everyone understands what to expect if they gamble with the film’s assets.\n\nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process\n\ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent,\n\nit needs to go through the resolution process with the owners losing then investment. However,\nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits\n\nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily\n\noperated as a bridge bank before either being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that\nthe banks go through the same process or else an incentive will be created for banks to take on\nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment.\n\nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works\nand what does not work. One way to do this is to look at past financial crises. This is not the first\n\n4\n\n\ffinancial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what will and will not be successful by looking back\n\nat our own history with financial crises, as well as at the experiences in other countries.\n\nIdentifying the Problem\n\nWith these principles in mind, how should we go about resolving the current problems at\nour largest institutions?\n\nFirst, we must determine both the location and size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not\nbe easy. These firms are very large - the four largest bank holding companies each have more\nthan $1 trillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They\n\nhave offices around the world, and they are involved in many complex businesses. But in order\n\nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of\nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect their losses in their financial statements.\n\nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in terms of the value of its equity capital.\nWhen the value of its assets is less than the value of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it\n\nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current\npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing\n\nliabilities, or it loses market confidence and cannot borrow enough.\n\nI would note that these are concrete definitions and not subjective conditions. I mention\n\nthis because it points out that the term “too big to fail” is a misstatement. It does not matter what\nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these\ndefinitions, it has failed.\n\n5\n\n\fOnce we determine a bank’s status, we would classify these institutions into three\ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as\nan ongoing concern.\n\nThe first category would be firms whose operations are strong and whose equity remains\n\nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.\n\nSome might need to raise additional capital to provide a greater cushion against the losses they\nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these institutions are basically sound and should be able\nto raise private capital.\n\nThe second category would be those institutions whose equity temporarily falls below\nminimtun requirements but are expected to recover in a reasonable period of tune as economic\n\nconditions improve. These films have generally sound management, who may have made some\nmistakes and suffered greater losses than normal due to the economic downturn. It is reasonable\n\nto expect these banks to raise additional private capital. However, the government may need to\nprovide some capital in the form of preferred shares and possibly some warrants in return. As an\n\nequity holder, the government would have an oversight role regarding the firms’ operations and\n\nactivities.\nThe final category is for the institutions that are no longer viable either because of\nliquidity problems or their equity capital is currently negative or it is likely to become negative,\n\nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which\nwould likely soon become equity insolvent without government protections and guarantees,\n\nwould be declared insolvent by the regulatory authority. Shareholders would be forced to bear\nthe full cost of the positions they have taken and risk losing their investment. Senior management\n\nand the board of directors would be replaced because they are responsible for the failed strategy.\n\n6\n\n\fA Resolution Process\nThe question then becomes how to resolve these failed institutions while minimizing the\ncost and disruption to the economy.\n\nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an\nassumption of its liabilities by another institution. For these extremely large firms, there are a\ncouple of significant roadblocks preventing this solution. First, the acquiring firm must have the\n\ncapacity for the acquisition, which means it would have to be in the same size range as the failed\ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forged, it would create an even larger firm with\n\ngreater systemic risks to the economy.\nInstead, an extremely large firm that has failed would have to be temporarily operated as\na conservatorship or a bridge organization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically\nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital without a change in the firm's ownership and\n\nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future.\nExperience shows that this approach has worked. The best example was with the failure\n\nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its holding company in 1984. Because we are in\nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental’s problems began with some bad loans it purchased\n\nfrom Oklahoma City’s Perm Square Bank. As an officer in out Bank’s regulatory function at that\n\ntime, I was directly involved in the closing of Penn Square. In fact, front 1982 to 1992, 347\nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance in the Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was\n\ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tragedies. I tell you this to make\nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or\n\n7\n\n\fpainless. But the process that worked for Continental Illinois is a viable approach to addressing\n\nimportant aspects of today’s crisis.\nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 billion in assets and was the\n\nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- largest bank in the United\nStates. It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and\n\ninternational correspondent relationships, and a separate function for making residential and\ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.\n\nWhen Continental failed, its top management and directors were replaced with\n\nindividuals who had experience operating large, complex organizations. John Swearingen,\nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding company, and William\nOgden, a former vice chainnan of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO.\nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of\n\nContinental’s balance sheet and placed them hr a separate work-out unit to recover as much of\nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those bad assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at\nthe time of the transaction.\nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continental’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in\n\ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock\n\nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in\nContinental.\nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants to purchase the remaining common stock for\n\nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001). If at the end of five years, the cost of the resolution was\nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise 100 percent of the warrants; if losses were\n\nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be in proportion to the amount of the losses.\n\n8\n\n\fTo economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation unit\nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel, hired specialists and Continental employees\n\nunder incentive contracts.\n\nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of\nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the warrants so the shareholders in Continental's\nholding company effectively lost their entire investment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred\nshares and shares from exercising the wanants for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200\n\nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in dividends. The ultimate resolution cost to the\nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets at the time of resolution.\nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically\n\nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as\nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait for new authority. We can act immediately, using\nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.\n\nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution\ncould be created within the institution so essential services and operations would continue as\nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provide capital in exchange for preferred shares\n\nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government\nwanants to purchase all outstanding shares with the amount exercised determined by the\ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior management and directors would be replaced.\nThe most difficult part of resolving these large firms without a new resolution process is\n\nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing\nobligations would be addressed and dealt with according to the covenants and contractual\n\npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insured creditors would have immediate access to their\n\n9\n\n\ffunds, while other creditors would have immediate access to maturing funds with the potential\nfor haircuts, depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely market\nimpact. However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors,\nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm\ninsolvent.\n\nRegardless of how the firm is resolved, short-term liabilities in particular would need to\nbe addressed immediately because of their importance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment\nobligations and operational needs. Quick decisions should also be made on all counterparty\n\narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the\ncounterparties.\nAuthorities would also need to assess the market impact - specifically, whether the losses\n\nassociated with this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in financial markets and serious\n\nfunding problems that would threaten the viability of other financial firms. If so, it may be\nnecessary to honor all counterparty arrangements and/or short-term liabilities, as we did with\n\nContinental Illinois.\nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.\nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as\n\nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, requiring approval by two-thirds of the Federal\nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation\n\nwith the president.\n\nAs much as I dislike extending government guarantees and thereby reducing market\ndiscipline, if we were to implement this exception, I believe we would also need to extend the\n\n10\n\n\fsame guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive\n\nadvantage.\n\nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance\nsheet of the failed institution at realistic market values and placed in an asset management\n\ncompany, resulting hi two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”\n\nAlternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.\nAfter writing off the bad assets, the government would provide the “good bank” with enough\n\ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and attractive to private investors for\n\nreprivatization. Any recoveries horn the bad bank would first go toward paying off the costs of\nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of\nremaining claimants.\n\nThe separation of the bad assets is critical. When a bank has a large share of\nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they are left on the balance sheet, even if they\n\nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not\n\nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates uncertainty about the bank’s financial condition\n\nand diverts management's attention horn the business objectives necessary for recovery. The\nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the future, gaining new customers and expanding\n\noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” must be on getting rid of customers and winding\n\ndown the operations.\n\nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to determine the advisability of\nbreaking up or selling off operations and independent subsidiaries where possible, especially\n\ngiven the market discipline problems we have encountered with institutions regarded as “too big\n\nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and viability of large, complex financial firms is\n\n11\n\n\fdifficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex\n\nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too\nbig and too complex an institution.\n\nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.\nAt the start of the TARP I program. $125 billion was provided to the nine largest\n\nfinancial firms without an in-depth, thorough exam of their condition. However, all other banks\nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator concluded they were strong enough to\n\nweather the crisis and continue as an ongoing concern.\nThe $10 per share that Bear Steams’ stockholders received from the JPMorgan Chase\nacquisition would not have been possible without the government’s guarantee of $29 billion of\n\nproblem assets. Additionally, the government has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s\ncontinued operations, with their shareholders standing to reap financial gam if AIG ultimately\n\nrecovers.\nMeanwhile. 46 banks in the United States have failed since the beginning of 2008. All of\n\nthem were resolved through one of the bank resolution problems I have discussed here today.\n\nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work?\n\nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it\nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere.\nThe economic situation in Sweden hi the early 1990s was similar to that in the United\nStates today. Its financial system was dominated by six large banks that accounted for 90\npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major\n\nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through\n\n12\n\n\fprivate sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off\n\ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to systematically\nrestore confidence hi its financial system, and although it took several years to work down and\nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it dealt with\nonly six banks. In addition, some argue that the Swedish system was much less complex, and\nthat the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead of\nthe complex financial assets, structured securities and derivatives that we would have to work\nout today.\n\nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has\nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory\n\nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is likely that few would require further government\nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real estate assets involve\n\nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives.\n\nAnother important example is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a\n\nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining problem banks and writing\ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values, making any needed and appropriate changes in\nbank management, injecting public equity as needed into these banks, and returning the banks to\nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be highly successfill in recapitalizing banks, and like\n\nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to taxpayers. More detailed information on both the\n\nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a\ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at KansasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation\n\n13\n\n\fof why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be useful to provide more details\naround my view that it can be done.\n\nLet me make two final points.\n\nFirst, the debate over the resolution of the largest financial firms is often sensationalized\nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing failed institutions. It is also pointed out that\n\ngovernment officials may not be effective managers of private business concerns.\nIn response, I would note that no firm would be nationalized hi this program.\nNationalization is the process of the government taking over a going concern with the intent of\n\noperating it. Though a bridge institution is the most likely outcome when a large financial firm\nfails, the goal is for the firm to be reprivatized as quickly as possible, hi addition, subject to\n\nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge fmn would be managed by private sector managers\nselected for their experience in operating well-run, large, complex organizations.\n\nThe second point is related to the complexity issue, which is that it would be hard to find\n\nenough people with the required knowledge, experience and skills to fill the open positions.\nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we were able to do it then. More generally: The\n\nUnited States is a vast country with a tremendous amount of management resources in a broad­\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have the talent to run these\nfirms, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion.\n\n14\n\n\f"

        "content": "Crisis: Reaction and Resolution\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nFinancial Stability Institute, Bank for International Settlements\nHigh-Level Meeting on Recent Developments in Financial Markets and Supervisory Responses\nLima, Peru\nApril 2, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fI am honored to be asked to provide some opening comments for this conference.\n\nOver the past year, we have all been heavily involved in the global financial crisis. As\npolicymakers and regulators, our mission during this turmoil is twofold. We are responding to\n\nemerging events, but at the same time we are also challenged with making the changes necessary\nto protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future.\n\nSo, the urgency on all sides is certainly warranted. The time it takes to resolve these\nissues only increases the cost and further delays the potential for a frill global economic recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, urgency often creates an environment where quick decisions prevail over well­\n\nthought-out solutions. The focus in times such as these is often on proximate causes instead of\nunderlying problems. The current crisis, unfortunately, has been no different.\nThere were many events involved in this crisis, and as I react to them and consider what\n\nthey mean from a regulatory perspective, I would suggest three key areas that need to change.\n\nFirst, regulation must be based on a clear set of simple, understandable and enforceable\nrales rather that a set of broad principles open to interpretation.\nSecond, this has been the first real test of Basel II, and it has failed to achieve its\nobjective.\n\nThird, we must produce a means for resolving fnms that some would deem “too-big-to-\n\nfail.” These institutions do fail and we must allow them to do so in a way that controls damage to\nthe entire financial sector.\n\nPrinciples-Based vs. Rules-Based Regulation\nhi recent years, there have been increasing calls for the United States and many other\ncountries to shift toward a risk-focused and principles-based approach to supervision and\n\n2\n\n\fregulation. Unlike a rales-based system, which might establish maximum loan-to-value ratios or\nlimit the amount an institution can lend, a principles-based system specifies desired outcomes\n\nand allows the regulated firms extensive control over how they achieve those results.\n\nAs a regulator responsible for ensuring stability, I can sum up the argument of principles\nversus rules very simply in my mind: Principles provide financial institutions with opportunities\n\nto debate; rales provide supervisors with the best chance to properly enforce sound practices.\nThose who support a principles-based system say that with rapid growth in the financial\n\nmarkets, supervisors no longer have the resources to monitor compliance with every rale and\nregulation. They say the principles-based approach gives institutions more flexibility in adapting\nto a rapidly evolving financial environment, thereby making a country’s financial markets more\n\nattractive, innovative and competitive on a worldwide basis.\nTo that I would respond that a carefiilly crafted niles-based approach does not hamper\n\nfinancial innovation. Good rulemaking incorporates public comment, thus giving institutions an\nopportunity to suggest less burdensome and more effective ways to achieve regulatory goals, hi a\n\nniles-based environment, supervisors cannot just mechanically impose the rales on regulated\n\nfirms, but must rely on a good dialogue with the firms as an important part of the supervisory\n\nprocess.\nBecause principles must constantly be interpreted, a principles-based approach by its very\n\nnature fosters an environment of less clarity and reduced transparency in the regulatory system.\n\nWith issues open to interpretation, supervisors also have less power to enforce regulations when\nan institution disagrees. Tills problem is particularly serious when an economy is strong and\n\nquestionable activities may appear to be successful hi the environment of the time. The result is\nlikely to be a gradual erosion of regulatory standards during prosperous times and greater harm\n\n3\n\n\fto institutions and the broader financial system when the economic cycle reverses direction. If\nthere is one thing that we have learned from the current crisis it is that we must have a strong set\n\nof rules in place to limit any erosion in regulatory standards over the cycle.\nMy final concern with principles-based regulation is that for it to be effective, regulators\n\nand firms must have consistent goals and incentives. There must be rnuhral trust. Although I\n\nthink we would all like for this ideal to be attainable, we know in reality that it is extremely\ndifficult to achieve.\n\nGiven the events that led to our current crisis, it strikes me that we must reemphasize\nlongstanding and proven niles-based standards to limit excessive risk-taking. There must be a\nfirm framework for enforcing and achieving our supervisory objectives.\n\nBasel II\nMany of the same issues surrounding principles-based regulation versus a rules-based\nsystem also apply to Basel II. The main “principle” underlying the Basel II framework is that\n\ncapital requirements should be closely aligned with the risk assumed by the financial institution.\n\nBasel II relies on institutions making detailed assessments of the risks they have assumed\nso a more precise capital requirement can be assigned. Basel II, in fact, allows banks to use credit\n\nratings and their own internal risk models to measure these risks and calculate their capital needs.\n\nhi this regard, Basel II would replace a system that was based on broad “risk buckets”\nand a set of “rules” that determined what should go in these risk buckets and what capital would\nneed to be held against these specific risk-asset measures.\n\nWhether this shift to a more principles-based capital framework under Basel II is\nbeneficial will depend orr a number of the points that I noted previously.\n\n4\n\n\fThese points include:\n\n•\n\nWill the flexibility provided to banks in using their own risk models lead to better\noutcomes, or will they create greater supervisory enforcement and compliance\n\nproblems?\n•\n\nWill it be more difficult to get banks to build up and maintain higher levels of\ncapital during more prosperous times?\n\n•\n\nCan supervisors ensure that all banks operating under the Basel II framework\n\nfollow a consistent approach in measuring capital needs?\nThe difficulties with using models to measure risks are well-known to all of us. They\nhave become painfully apparent in the current financial crisis. Consequently, we must be\n\ncautious in how we set capital requirements and limit financial leverage. Models and credit\nratings don’t anticipate shifting risks very well.\n\nModels calibrated during periods of stress can overestimate risk and reinforce the\nprocyclical effects of capital regulation.\nEven more disastrous are calibrations performed during good times that can cause models\nto underestimate the risks of turbulent conditions and leave banks holding insufficient capital. An\nexample is provided by the experience of Britain’s Northern Rock. At the time of its collapse,\n\nNorthern Rock had calculated that it had substantial surplus capital under Basel II and was close\nto receiving regulatory approval to dividend out the “extra” capital to its shareholders.\n\nModels can fail to measure adequately a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic shocks and\nwill not measure risks not previously experienced. For example, many risk models clearly failed\nto anticipate the downturn in housing prices that we have seen over the last several years. A more\nspecific example is the counterparties to AIG’s credit default swaps, who took steps to protect\n\n5\n\n\fthemselves from credit risk by including collateral requirements in then swap contracts.\n\nHowever, the counterparties did not anticipate that AIG’s overall risk would exceed the amount\nof collateral it could provide. Consequently, the counterparties’ models did not indicate that\ncapital was needed for this exposure or that the institutions should shift their business away from\n\nAIG.\n\nAnother important problem is that models make enforcement of capital adequacy more\ndifficult. Examiners must try to understand and evaluate very complex mathematical models, and\nwhen these models appear to understate capital needs, examiners will have a difficult time\n\narguing the technical merits of their views and convincing bank management of a need to add\n\ncapital, hi too many cases, because management’ s ROE depends on reducing capital, the result\nwill be insufficient capital and excessive bank leverage.\n\nBanks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage. Leverage\n\nincreases profitability during good times, but it necessarily increases risk. We have seen the\nbroad systemic effects of excessive leverage in the current environment. hi many ways, the Basle\nII model-based capital regime provides banks with a rationale, a defense and an opportunity for\n\ntaking excessive leverage.\n\nOverleveraging has been a major problem during the current market meltdown - both\n\namong the institutions now operating under Basel II and among those that will soon come under\nthis framework.\nTo limit such problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage\n\nthrough strict rales that set a miniminn capital-to-assets ratio. This type of rale would be the\neasiest, most equitable and clear-cut way to set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for\na broader range of firms throughout our financial markets.\n\n6\n\n\fA leverage standard would also be much harder to evade than capital standards based on\nan institution’s own estimates of risk exposure. I am particularly concerned that institutions that\n\nunderestimate their risk exposures under the Basel II framework will invariably hold less capital\nthan they need and be the first to have serious problems during a crisis. Consequently, as we\n\ndiscuss how we might strengthen the Basel II framework today, I believe we should also give\nattention to how we can underpin this approach with a strict rule on the amount of leverage an\ninstitution can assume. While leverage requirements are not a panacea for supervising financial\n\nfirms, it is clear that if you want to direct your resources to where you are most likely to have\n\nproblems, you can direct them to the more highly leveraged and weakened firms.\n\nA Resolution Framework for Institutions Deemed “Too Big to Fail”\nFinally, tills meeting will be looking at how we should deal with instihitions that are\nsystemically important or what many call “too big to fail.” Although discussions about\nsupervisory framework and capital regulation are vitally important, the idea that some\n\ninstitutions can be too big to fail, and thereby receive special treatment, is the most immediate\n\nconcern and the area where the actions so far have been most troubling.\nThere are very real and rapidly escalating costs that are being absorbed by the U.S.\n\ntaxpayers. There are also some very important questions that, in the name of “urgent,” have been\n\npushed to the side rather than addressed in a systematic fashion, hi recent weeks, you have seen\noutrage hi the United States over bonuses paid to some employees of AIG, which has received\nsubstantial government funding. We must think through carefully the consequences of well-\n\nintentioned but rushed decisions. Although the extreme costs of the bailout have received much\n\n\fof the attention, there are other fundamental questions about competitive fairness, capitalism and\n\nfinancial markets that must be considered as well.\nhi the interest of time, I will raise only one example right now. Currently, the stock prices\n\nof some of these “too big to fail” financial companies are hading for a fr action of their pre-crisis\nlevels, although billions of government dollars in the form of capital, loans and guarantees are\n\nbeing pumped into these films to avoid either capital or liquidity insolvency. If the government\nstays the current course and it works, the stock prices will rise. For a shareholder buying in at\n\ncurrent levels, a return to even half of what the shares traded at a couple of years ago could\ngenerate very large returns. So, not only are taxpayers picking up the tab for making these firms\nviable, they are also taking on an inordinate amount of the risk and leaving the rewards for\n\nprivate investors. And I suspect that as the markets become more confident that the government\n\nwill continue its support for “too big to fail,” the price of such shares will indeed bring handsome\nreturns.\n\nWith issues like this in mind, I recently gave a speech on this topic, titled. “Too Big Has\nFailed.” I would like to take a few moments to reiterate some of the key points concerning how\n\nwe might address this issue.\nOne comparison I drew was between Japan and Sweden. As you may recall, Japan took a\n\nvery gradual and delayed approach in the 1990s to addr essing its banking problems and put off\ndealing with a critical shortage of capital in its banks, hi contrast, after a severe real estate\n\ncollapse in the early 1990s, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial\ninstitutions. The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources,\n\nand public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad assets\n\nto be managed within a separate entity. Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its\n\n8\n\n\ffinancial system at little cost to taxpayers, while Japan continued to have a weakened banking\nsystem for much of the 1990s.\n\nAnother important example is the Reconstruction Finance Coiporation (RFC), which was\nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC proved to be\n\nhighly successfill in using public funds to recapitalize banks with no net cost to taxpayers. This\nsuccess was based on the RFC’s adherence to a sound set of principles, beginning with writing\n\ndown the bad assets at a bank to realistic economic values and making any needed and\n\nappropriate changes in bank management before injecting public equity into the bank.\nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984. Although\n\nContinental Illinois was essentially deemed “too big to fail” and was handled through an open\nbank assistance program, it showed that U.S. banking authorities could take over a very large\n\nbank, replace its management and wipe out stockholders, and then restore the bank to sound\ncondition and return it to private ownership.\nThere are several lessons that we can draw from these past experiences.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the losses in the financial system won’t go away - they will only fester and\nincrease while impeding our chances for a recovery.\n\n•\n\nSecond, we must take a consistent, timely and specific approach to major\n\ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce market uncertainty and bring in\nprivate investors and market funding.\n\n•\n\nThird, if institutions - no matter what their size - have lost market confidence and\ncan’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses, bring in\n\ncapable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and businesses,\nand begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.\n\n9\n\n\fThe question that supervisors hi all countries must ask themselves is: How can we best\n\nresolve problems at financial institutions that are deemed to be “too big to fail”?\nOne guide to how we could proceed in the United States is the process we use for failing\n\nbanks. This approach - albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big to fail” banks - has been\ndeveloped over time in response to previous crises and deals with many of the issues that need to\n\nbe resolved in today’s environment.\n\nOur bank resolution process focuses on timely action to protect depositors and limit\nspillover effects to the economy and the rest of the financial system. For instance, insured\ndepositors at failed banks typically receive immediate access to their funds, while uninsured\ndepositors often receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries or, hi systemic\n\ncircumstances, may be frilly protected.\nAlso, we have a variety of means for resolving failed banks and ensuring a continuity of\nessential seivices. including selling all or part of a failed bank to a bank in sound condition or\n\noperating the bank under regulatory oversight through a bridge bank, conservatorship or open\nbank assistance. These options focus on bringing in capable management, while putting the\nshareholders at failed banks fust in line to absorb losses. The FDIC, as receiver for failed banks,\n\nmust pursue the least costly option - except in systemic circumstances - in order to protect the\n\ndeposit insurance fund and taxpayers.\nI support constructing a similar resolution program that we could apply consistently to all\n“too big to fail” institutions, including banks, bank and financial holding companies, and\nnonbank financial institutions.\n\nWithout going into details, I think a resolution plan for “too big to fail” institutions\nshould be based on several principles.\n\n10\n\n\fFirst, it must be equitable and consistent when compared to how other failing financial\ninstitutions and their customers are treated. Giving any type of institution special treatment will\n\nundermine confidence in the fairness of the financial system, increase moral hazard problems\n\nand provide incentives for taking greater risk.\n\nSecond, a plan must ensure timely action to protect customers and provide for a\ncontinuity of essential financial services, much like many countries have done in giving\ndepositors at failed banks immediate access to all or a major portion of their fimds. I would also\n\nargue for establishing a clear priority for handling claims, with shareholders and large unsecured\n\ncreditors having to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken. In addition, to prevent\ndelay's and political interference. I believe it is important to have a source of public fimds that\ncan be tapped for resolutions and for this resolution authority to be put largely under the control\nof independent supervisory agencies.\n\nWhile some have criticized this type of approach on the grounds that we would be\n“nationalizing” our financial system and that regulators are ill-equipped to take over and operate\na large institution, this is not what I believe or advocate.\n\nResolving problems at failing institutions is some tiling that public authorities have done\nmany times in the past. While it may take more time to work out the problems at larger\n\ninstitutions and return them to private ownership, this is still a temporary step that would be\n\ntaken with a limited number of institutions. Moreover, the experience of banking agencies in\ndealing with significant failures indicates that regulators are capable of bringing in qualified\n\nmanagement and finding specialized expertise when needed.\n\nIf we don’t take decisive steps to resolve major banking problems, I believe we will face\na much more serious set of issues. In fact, leaving failing institutions to continue their operations\n\n11\n\n\fwith a failed management team in place is certain to prove more costly in the long run and less\nlikely to restore public confidence and get us back on the path to recovery.\nFinns that rely on significant infusions of public funds have failed. We need to stop\n\npropping them up and start taking them apart in an orderly manner.\n\nConclusion\nBefore I conclude, I would like to make one final comment. There is no doubt that the\nmonths to come will be filled with talk about sweeping regulatory changes. The actions of the\nlast several months, rather than solving the problem, seem to have added only more questions to\n\nthe debate. I hope, in this instance, instead of being led down a path of “urgent” action, we\n\ncarefully consider solutions. In the United States, there is talk about the need for a financial\nstability regulator and who should fill that role. I believe that the Federal Reserve, by design, has\n\nthat responsibility and must start filling that role. Instead or rewriting the rule book, I think we\nneed to first enforce what is already there and do it in a fair and evenhanded manner that is not\n\ninfluenced by circumstances we decide are “special” because of the nature of the problem or the\nsize of the firm involved.\nThe current financial crisis is providing a very comprehensive test of our financial\n\nsystems and supervisory frameworks. We are all clearly interested in identifying what went\n\nwrong, what can we do to work our way out of today’s problems, and what we should do going\nforward. I am certainly looking forward to this meeting and hearing everyone’s views on the\n\nchallenges we face.\n\n12\n\n\f"

        "content": "TOO BIG HAS FAILED\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nOmaha, Neb.\nMarch 6, 2009\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officer's or\nrepresentatives.\n\n\fTwo years ago, we stalled seeing a problem in a specialized area of financial markets\n\nthat many people had never heard of. known as the subprime mortgage market. At that time,\n\nmost policymakers thought the problems would be self-contained and have limited impact on\nthe broader economy. Today, we know differently. We are in the midst of a very serious\n\nfinancial crisis, and our economy is under significant stress.\n\nOver the past year, the Federal government and financial policy makers have enacted\nnumerous programs and committed trillions of dollars of public funds to address the crisis.\n\nAnd still the problems remain. We have yet to restore confidence and transparency to the\nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and investors wary of making new commitments.\n\nThe outcome so far, while disappointing, is perhaps not surprising.\nWe have been slow to face up to the fundamental problems in our financial system\nand reluctant to take decisive action with respect to failing institutions. We are slowly\nbeginning to deal with the overhang of problem assets and management weaknesses in some\n\nof our largest firms that this crisis is revealing. We have been quick to provide liquidity and\npublic capital, but we have not defined a consistent plan and not addressed basic\n\nshortcomings and, hi some cases, the insolvent position of these institutions.\n\nWe understandably would prefer not to “nationalize” these businesses, but in reacting\n\nas we are, we nevertheless are drifting into a situation where institutions are being\nnationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis.\n\nWith conditions deteriorating around us, I will offer my views on how we might yet\ndeal with the current state of affairs. I’ll start with a brief overview of the policy actions we\nhave been pursuing, but I will also provide perspective on the actions we have taken and the\noutcomes we have experienced in previous financial crises. Finally, I will suggest what\n\n2\n\n\flessons we might take from these previous crises and apply to working our way out of the\ncurrent crisis.\nIn suggesting alternative solutions, I acknowledge it is no simple matter to solve.\n\nPeople say “it can’t be done” when speaking of allowing large institutions to fail. But I don’t\nthink that those who managed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Resolution Trust\n\nCorporation, the Swedish financial crisis or any other financial crisis were handed a blueprint\nthat carried a guarantee of success. I don’t accept that we have lost our ability to solve a new\n\nproblem, especially when it looks like a familiar problem.\n\nCurrent Policy Actions and Problems\n\nMuch has been written about how we got into our current situation, most notably the\n\nbreakdowns in our mortgage finance system, weak or neglected risk management practices,\nand highly leveraged and interconnected firms and financial markets. Because this has been\n\nwell-documented, today I will focus on the policy responses we have tried so far and where\n\nthey appear to be falling short.\n\nA wide range of policy steps has been taken to support financial institutions and\n\nimprove the flow of credit to businesses and households. In the interest of time, I will go\nover the list quickly.\n\nAs a means of providing liquidity to the financial system and the economy, the\nFederal Reserve has reduced the targeted federal funds rate in a series of steps from 5.25\npercent at mid-year 2007 to the present 0 to 25 basis-point range. In addition, the Federal\n\nReseive has instituted a wide range of new lending programs and, through its emergency\nlending powers, has extended this lending beyond depository institutions.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have also\narranged bailouts and mergers for large struggling or insolvent institutions, including Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, Bear Steams, WaMu, Wachovia, AIG, Countrywide, and Merrill\n\nLynch. But other firms, such as Lehman Brothers, have been allowed to fail.\n\nThe Treasury has invested public funds, buying preferred stock in more than 400\nfinancial institutions through the TARP program. TARP money has also been used to fund\ngovernment guarantees of more than $400 billion of securities held by major financial\n\ninstitutions, such as CitiGroup and Bank of America. In addition, the Federal Reserve and\nthe Treasury Department have committed more than $ 170 billion to bail out the troubled\n\ninsurance company AIG.\n\nOther actions have included increased deposit insurance limits and guarantees for\nbank debt instruments and money market mutual funds.\n\nThe most recent step is the Treasury financial stability plan, which provides for a new\nround of TARP spending and controls, assistance for struggling homeowners, and a plan for\n\na government/private sector partnership to buy up bad assets held by financial institutions\n\nand others.\n\nThe sequence of these actions, unfortunately, has added to market uncertainty.\nInvestors are understandably watching to see which institutions will receive public money\nand survive as wards of the state.\n\nAny financial crisis leaves a stream of losses embedded among the various\nparticipants, and these losses must ultimately be borne by someone. To start the resolution\nprocess, management responsible for the problems must be replaced and the losses identified\n\nand taken. Until these kinds of actions are taken, there is little chance to restore market\n\n4\n\n\fconfidence and get credit markets flowing. It is not a question of avoiding these losses, but\none of how soon we will take them and get on to the process of recovery. Economist Allan\n\nMeltzer may have expressed this point best when he said that “capitalism without failure is\n\nlike religion without sin.”\n\nWhat Might We Learn from Previous Financial Crises?\nMany of the policy actions I just described provide support to the largest financial\n\ninstihitions, those that are frequently referred to as “too big to fail.” A rationale for such\nactions is that the failure of a large institution would have a systemic impact on the economy.\nIt is emphasized that markets have become more complex, and institutions - both bank and\n\nnonbank entities - are now larger and connected more closely thr ough a complicated set of\n\nrelationships. Often, they point to the negative impact on the economy caused by last year’s\nfailure of Lehman Brothers.\n\nHistory, however, may show us another experience. When examining previous\nfinancial crises, in other countries as well as in the United States, large instihitions have been\nallowed to fail. Banking authorities have been successful hi placing new and more\nresponsible managers and directors in charge and then reprivatizing them. There is also\n\nevidence suggesting that countries that have tried to avoid taking such steps have been much\nslower to recover, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers has been larger.\nThere are several examples that illustrate these points and show what has worked hi\n\nprevious crises and what hasn’t. A comparison that many are starting to draw now is with\nwhat happened in Japan and Sweden.\n\n5\n\n\fJapan took a very gradual and delayed approach in addressing the problems in its\nbanks. A series of limited steps spread out over a number of years were taken to slowly\nremove bad assets from the banks, and Japan put off efforts to address an even more\n\nfundamental problem - a critical shortage of capital in these banks. As a result, the banks\nwere left in the position of having to focus on past problems with little resources available to\nhelp finance any economic recovery.\nIn contrast, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial\n\ninstitutions and insisted that solvent institutions restore capital and clean up their balance\n\nsheets. The Swedish government did provide loans to solvent institutions, but only if they\nalso raised private capital.\n\nSweden dealt firmly with insolvent institutions, including operating two of the largest\nbanks under governmental oversight with the goal of bringing in private capital within a\n\nreasonable amount of time. To deal with the bad assets in these banks, Sweden created wellcapitalized asset management corporations or what we might call “bad banks.” This step\nallowed the problem assets to be dealt with separately and systematically, while other\n\nbanking operations continued under a transparent and focused framework.\n\nThe end result of this approach was to restore confidence in the Swedish banking\nsystem hr a timely manner and limit the amount of taxpayer losses. Sweden, which\n\nexperienced a real estate decline more severe than that in the United States, was able to\nresolve its banking problems at a long term net cost of less than 2 percent of GDP.\nWe can also learn a great deal from how the United States has dealt with previous\n\ncrises. There has been a lot written attempting to draw parallels with the Great Depression.\n\n6\n\n\fThe main way that we dealt with struggling banks at that time was through the\nReconstruction Finance Corporation.\n\nWithout going into great detail about the RFC, I will note the four principles that\nJesse Jones, the head of the RFC, employed in restructuring banks. The first step was to\n\nwrite down a bank’s bad assets to realistic economic values. Next, the RFC would judge the\ncharacter and capacity of bank management and make any needed and appropriate changes.\n\nThe third step was to inject equity in the form of preferred stock, but this step did not occur\nuntil realistic asset values and capable management were in place. The final step was\n\nreceiving the dividends and eventually recovering the par value of the stock as a bank\nreturned to profitability and frill private ownership.\n\nAt one point in 1933, the RFC held capital hi more than 40 percent of all banks,\nrepresenting one-third of total bank capital according to some estimates. but because of the\n\nfour principles of Jesse Jones, this was all carried out without any net cost to the government\nor to taxpayers.\n\nIf we compare the TARP program to the RFC, TARP began without a clear set of\nprinciples and has proceeded with what seems to be an ad hoc and less-than-transparent\napproach in the case of banks judged “too big to fail.” In both the RFC and Swedish\n\nexperiences, triage was first used to set priorities and determine what institutions should be\n\naddressed immediately. TARP treated the largest institutions as one. As we move forward\nfrom here, therefore, we would be wise to have a systematic set of principles and a detailed\nplan to guide us.\n\nAnother example we need to be aware of relates to the thrift problems of the 1980s.\n\nBecause the thrift insurance fund was inadequate to avoid the losses embedded in thrift\n\n7\n\n\fbalance sheets, an attempt was made to cover over the losses with net worth certificates and\n\nexpanded powers that were supposed to allow thrifts to grow out of their problems. A\nnotable fraction of the thrift industry was insolvent, but continued to operate as so-called\n“zombie” or “living dead” thrifts. As you may recall, this attempt to postpone closing\n\ninsolvent thrifts did not end well, but instead added greatly to the eventual losses and led to\ngreater real estate problems.\n\nA final example — our approach to large bank problems in the 1980s and early 1990s\n\n— shows that we have taken some steps to deal with banking organizations that are\nconsidered “too big to fail” or very important on a regional level.\n\nThe most prominent example is Continental Illinois’ failure in 1984. Continental was\nthe seventh-largest bank in the country, the largest domestic commercial and industrial\n\nlender, and the bank that popularized the phr ase “too big to fail.” Questions about\nContinental’s soundness led to a tun by large foreign depositors in May of 1984.\n\nBut looking back. Continental actually was allowed to fail. Although the FDIC put\n\ntogether an open bank assistance plan and injected capital in the form of preferred stock, it\nalso brought in new management at the top level, and shareholders, who were the bank’s\nowners, lost their entire investment. The FDIC also separated the problem assets from the\n\nbank, which left a clean bank to be restructured and eventually sold. To liquidate the bad\nassets, the FDIC hired specialists to oversee the different categories of loans and entered into\na service agreement with Continental that provided incentive compensation for its staff to\nhelp with the liquidation process.\n\nA lesson to be drawn from Continental is that even large banks can be dealt with in a\nmanner that imposes market discipline otr management and stockholders, while controlling\n\n8\n\n\ftaxpayer losses. The FDIC’s asset disposition model in Continental, which used incentive\nfees and contracts with outside specialists, also proved to be an effective and workable\n\nmodel. This model was employed again in the failure of Bank of New England in 1991, the\n\nfailures of nearly all of the large banking organizations in Texas hi the 1980s, and also for the\nResolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to liquidate failed thrifts.\n\nResolving the Current Crisis\nTurning to the current crisis, there are several lessons we can draw from these past\nexperiences.\n\n•\n\nFirst, the losses in the financial system won’t go away - they will only fester\nand increase while impeding our chances for a recovery.\n\n•\n\nSecond, we must take a consistent, timely, and specific approach to major\n\ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce market uncertainty and\nbring in private investors and market funding.\n\n•\n\nThird, if institutions - no matter what their size — have lost market confidence\nand can’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses,\n\nbring in capable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and\nbusinesses, and begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.\n\nHow can we do this today in an era where we have to deal with systemic issues rising\nnot only from very large banks, but also from many other segments of the marketplace? I\n\nwould be the first to acknowledge that some tilings have changed in our financial markets,\nbut financial crises continue to occur for the same reasons as always - over-optimism,\n\n9\n\n\fexcessive debt and leverage ratios, and misguided incentives and perspectives - and our\n\nsolutions must continue to address these basic problems.\n\nThe process we use for failing banks — albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big\nto fail” banks — provides some first insight into the principles we should establish in dealing\n\nwith financial institutions of any type.\nOur bank resolution framework focuses on timely action to protect depositors and\nother claimants, while limiting spillover effects to the economy. Insured depositors at failed\n\nbanks typically gain frill and immediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors\noften receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries.\n\nTo provide for a continuation of essential banking services, the FDIC may choose\n\nfrom a variety of options, including purchase and assumption transactions, deposit transfers\nor payouts, bridge banks, conservatorships, and open bank assistance. These options focus\n\non transferring important banking functions over to sound banking organizations with\n\ncapable management, while putting shareholders at failed banks first in line to absorb losses.\nOther important features in resolving failing banks include an established priority for\nhandling claimants, prompt corrective action, and least-cost resolution provisions to protect\n\nthe deposit insurance fluid and, ultimately, taxpayers and to also bring as much market\n\ndiscipline to the process as possible.\n\nI would argue for constructing a defined resolution program for “too big to fail”\nbanks and bank holding companies, and nonbank financial institutions. It is especially\nnecessary in cases where the normal bankruptcy process may be too slow or disruptive to\n\nfinancial market activities and relationships. The program and resolution process should be\n\n10\n\n\fimplemented on a consistent, transparent and equitable basis whether we are resolving small\n\nbanks, large banks or other complex financial entities.\n\nHow should we structure this resolution process? While a number of details would\n\nneed to be worked out, let me provide a broad outline of how it might be done.\nFirst, public authorities would be directed to declare any financial institution\ninsolvent whenever its capital level falls too low to support its ongoing operations and the\n\nclaims against it, or whenever the market loses confidence in the firm and refuses to provide\n\nfunding and capital. This directive should be clearly stated and consistently adhered to for all\nfinancial institutions that are part of the intermediation process or payments system. We\n\nmust also recognize up front that the FDIC’s resources and other financial industry support\n\nfunds may not always be sufficient for this task and that Treasury money may also be\n\nneeded.\nNext, public authorities should use receivership, conservatorship or “bridge bank”\npowers to take over the failing institution and continue its operations under new\n\nmanagement. Following what we have done with banks, a receiver would then take out all or\na portion of the bad assets and either sell the remaining operations to one or more sound\nfinancial institutions or arrange for the operations to continue on a bridge basis under new\n\nmanagement and professional oversight. In the case of larger institutions with complex\n\noperations, such bridge operations would need to continue until a plan can be carried out for\ncleaning up and restructuring the firm and then reprivatizing it.\n\nShareholders would be forced to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken and\nsuffer the resulting losses. The newly restructured institution would continue the essential\n\nservices and operations of the failing firm.\n\n11\n\n\fAll existing obligations would be addressed and dealt with according to whatever\n\npriority is set up for handling claims. This could go so far as providing 100 percent\nguarantees to all liabilities, or, alternatively, it could include resolving short-term claims\nexpeditiously and, in the case of uninsured claims, giving access to maturing binds with the\npotential for haircuts depending on expected recoveries, any collateral protection and likely\nmarket impact.\nThere is legitimate concern for addressing these issues when institutions have\n\nsignificant foreign operations. However, if all liabilities are guaranteed, for example, and the\ninstitution is in receivership, such international complexities could be addressed\n\nsatisfactorily.\nOne other point in resolving “too big to fail” institutions is that public authorities\n\nshould take care not to worsen our exposure to such institutions going forward. In fact, for\nfailed institutions that have proven to be too big or too complex to manage well, steps must\n\nbe taken to break up their operations and sell them off in more manageable pieces. We must\n\nalso look for other ways to limit the creation and growth of films that might be considered\n“too big to fail.”\nIn this regard, our recent experience with ad hoc solutions to large failing firms has\n\nled to even more concentrated financial markets as only the largest institutions are likely to\n\nhave the available resources for the type of hasty takeovers that have occurred. Another\ndrawback is that these organizations do not have the time for necessary “due diligence”\n\nassessments and, as we have seen, may encounter serious acquisition problems. Under a\nmore orderly resolution process, public authorities would have the time to be more selective\n\n12\n\n\fand bring in a wider group of bidders, and they would be able to offer all or portions of\n\ninstitutions that have been restored to sound conditions.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nWhile hardly painless and with much complexity itself, this approach to addressing\n“too big to fail” strikes me as constructive and as having a proven track record. Moreover,\n\nthe current path is beset by ad hoc decision making and the potential for much political\n\ninterference, including efforts to force problem institutions to lend if they accept public\nfunds; operate under other imposed controls; and limit management pay, bonuses and\n\nseverance.\n\nIf an institution's management has failed the test of the marketplace, these managers\nshould be replaced. They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed, as we\nare now doing under TARP, with a set of political strings attached.\n\nMany are now beginning to criticize the idea of public authorities taking over large\n\ninstihitions on the grounds that we would be “nationalizing” our financial system. I believe\nthat this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is aimed at cleaning up a\n\nlimited number of failed institutions and returning them to private ownership as soon as\n\npossible. This is something that the banking agencies have done many times before with\n\nsmaller instihitions and, in selected cases, with very large instihitions. In many ways, it is\nalso similar to what is typically done in a bankruptcy court, but with an emphasis on ensuring\na continuity of services. In contrast, what we have been doing so far is eveiy bit a process\nthat results in a protracted nationalization of “too big to fail” instihitions.\n\n13\n\n\fThe issue that we should be most concerned about is what approach will produce\nconsistent and equitable outcomes and will get us back on the path to recovery in the quickest\nmanner and at reasonable cost. While it may take us some time to clean up and reprivatize a\n\nlarge institution in today’s environment — and I do not intend to underestimate the difficulties\nthat would be encountered — the alternative of leaving an institution to continue its\n\noperations with a failed management team in place is certain to be more costly and far less\nlikely to produce a desirable outcome.\nIn a similar fashion, some are now claiming that public authorities do not have the\n\nexpertise and capacity to take over and run a “too big to fail” institution. They contend that\nsuch takeovers would destroy a firin’s inherent value, give talented employees a reason to\n\nleave, cause further financial panic and require many years for the restructuring process. We\nshould ask, though, why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under\nthe control of failing managers, dealing with the large volume of “toxic” assets they created\nand coping with a raft of politically imposed controls that would be placed on their\n\noperations?\nIn contrast, a firm resolution process could be placed under the oversight of\n\nindependent regulatory agencies whenever possible and ideally would be funded through a\ncombination of Treasury and financial industry fluids.\nFurthermore, the experience of the banking agencies in dealing with significant\nfailures indicates that financial regulators are capable of bringing hi qualified management\nand specialized expertise to restore failing institutions to soimd health. This rebuilding\n\nprocess thus provides a means of restoring value to an institution, while creating the type of\nstable environment necessary to maintain and attract talented employees. Regulatory\n\n14\n\n\fagencies also have a proven track record in handling large volumes of problem assets - a\nrecord that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a way that best protects public\n\nfunds.\n\nFinally, I would argue that creating a framework that can handle the failure of\n\ninstitutions of any size will restore an important element of market discipline to our financial\nsystem, limit moral hazard concerns, and assure the fairness of treatment from the smallest to\n\nthe largest organizations that that is the hallmark of our economic system.\n\n15\n\n\f"

        "content": "The U.S. Economic Outlook:\nThe Aftermath of Leverage\n\nThomas M. Hoenig\nPresident\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nThe Central Exchange\nKansas City, Missouri\nJanuary 7, 2009\n\n\f2\n\nI am pleased to once again be at the Central Exchange to share my outlook for the\neconomy. It doesn’t seem possible that it has been a year since I last spoke here and\nsuggested that though the economy was going to slow, there was still the possibility of\navoiding a recession. I thought we might avoid the recession if the housing market\n\nstabilized and the financial sector avoided further shocks.\n\nThe sad truth is that over the past year, the economy has been affected by several\nshocks - the further decline hi housing, the turmoil in financial markets, and a sharp drop\n\nin consumer and business confidence. With the benefit of hindsight, we should not be all\nthat surprised by the onset of these shocks. They are a consequence of excessive leverage\n\naccumulated over a decade, about which many of us expressed concerns.\n\nThe remedy to what we now face will require a rebalancing of domestic savings\nand investment within the U.S. economy. This rebalancing process and the length and\n\ndepth of the recession itself will be determined importantly by how quickly financial\n\nfirms, businesses and the consumer rebuild their diminished wealth and regain their\nconfidence. It will be influenced also by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented actions\n\nand funding programs and forthcoming fiscal initiatives.\n\nThese are challenging times to say the least, and for the next few minutes, I want\nto share with you my perspective on them. I will start with some background on what led\nto this recession and then describe for you my outlook for 2009. I also will provide what\ninformation I can on the policy actions being taken to influence this outlook. And let me\n\nsay at the outset that though I agree we must do all we reasonably can to revive the\neconomy, I caution, based on my years of experience, that in our haste to mitigate this\n\nrecession’s effects, we not attempt shortcuts that put at risk future stability and growth.\n\n\f3\nThe U.S. Economy is in Recession\n\nThe U.S. recession, we are told by the NBER, officially began more than a year\nago hi December 2007. In the third quarter of 2008, real GDP growth was -0.5 percent,\nand recent data suggests that the economy contracted at a much sharper rate in the fourth\n\nquarter.\nLabor markets have weakened considerably throughout the year. The\n\nunemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in January 2008 to 6.7 percent in\nNovember, and total employment has fallen by 1.8 million jobs. And, as evidenced by\nthe November employment report and recent layoff announcements, the deterioration in\nlabor markets has intensified.\n\nWorse yet, economic growth has slowed sharply in the rest of the world. Several\nEuropean countries along with Japan appear to be in recession. As growth in the rest of\nthe world slows, so does demand for U.S. exports, which was the one bright spot in the\n\nU.S. economy in 2008.\nFinally, as is usually the case with recession, inflation has moderated considerably\nin recent months. After surging in the earlier half of 2008, the headline price indexes fell\n\nsharply in October and November due to the steep fall in energy prices. Core inflation\n\nalso moderated following weak consumer demand and declining production costs from\n\nlower energy and commodity prices. But while inflation is receding for the moment, I\nmust remind you that monetary policy is extremely accommodative, and if it remains so\ntoo long, as history suggests it may, inflation pressures could re-emerge as the economy\n\nrecovers.\n\n\f4\nFinancial Leverage\n\nIt seems so clear now. doesn’t it, that the key factor underlying the current\neconomic downturn has been the behavior of financial institutions and consumers, who\nincreased their borrowing to unprecedented and ultimately unsustainable levels in the\n\nexcitement of the “boom” in housing. As the reality of this leverage finally emerged, its\neffects started to show most notably in August 2007. An asset-pricing crisis eventually\n\nwidened into a confidence crisis that spread tlnoughout the economy.\nBetween 2001 and 2007, in an environment of low and then slowly rising interest\nrates and easy credit availability, financial institutions dramatically increased their\n\npackaging and selling of mortgages in response to increased demand for these securitized\nassets. During this period of rapidly rising real estate prices, these assets were judged to\n\nbe safe, profitable investments.\nIn addition, we saw a singe in debt. Financial firms increased the level of\n\ndomestic financial debt from $8.5 trillion to $16 trillion, or by 90 percent. Mortgage debt\nincreased from $4.9 billion to $10.5 trillion, a 114 percent increase. And total public\n\ndebt outstanding increased from $3.4 trillion to $5.2 trillion. The building of assets\nthrough the use of debt was the way to easy wealth, so it seemed.\nWhen the rise in real estate prices stalled in late 2006, investors became\nincreasingly concerned about the value of these securitized, leveraged assets, hr August\n2007, the financial crisis emerged, bill force, as short-term lending began to seize up.\n\nThe firms most strongly affected by these events were, of course, those that “took\nadvantage” of one of the most aggressive leveraging periods in financial history. The\n\ndebt-to-capital ratios for the largest 10 bank holding companies in aggregate increased\n\n\f5\nover the past ten years from about 14 to 1 to over 21 to 1. The debt-to-capital ratios for\n\nthe investment banks were even higher at over 30 to 1.\n\nThe crisis that emerged as the implications of this leverage became more apparent\nresembled an old-style bank run. As problems developed and confidence waned many of\nthese institutions found themselves without funding. They were unable to sell their\n\nsecurities in the market given the concents about the value of the underlying assets.\n\nThese events caused a broad base of participants to pull out of the markets to the point\n\nwhere they no longer function properly.\n\nThe resolution of the crisis will occur when the deleveraging process hits bottom\nand financial institutions are able to resume their role as intermediaries. This I suspect is\n\ndependent on at least two factors.\n\nFirst, a stable market price needs to be established for the currently illiquid assets\nsitting on the balance sheets of financial institutions. Until these assets can be adequately\n\nvalued and losses absorbed and future losses staunched, financial firms are going to have\n\na difficult time raising capital and extending new loans.\n\nSecond, this will take time and will not be painless or simple to accomplish. It\n\nwill require actions by both the monetary and fiscal authorities that are well thought out,\nwell-defined, hilly disclosed, and firmly and consistently executed across all financial\nfirms. We have learned from events over this past year that this is no easy task.\n\n\f6\nConsumer Leverage\nA related event having substantial negative repercussions for the U.S. economy is\nthe fallout from the leveraging of U.S. consumers. Between 2001 and 2007, household\ndebt increased from 97 percent of disposable personal income to 133 percent. This\nmassive increase in borrowing was reflected most vividly through the increase of\n\nmortgage debt. The mortgage refinancing boom allowed homeowners to extract large\n\nquantities of equity from their homes at a time when house prices were appreciating\nrapidly. The overall result was that consumers spent at a rate roughly equal to their\nincomes, savings rates plunged to zero and borrowing soared.\n\nMuch of this borrowing was funded by foreigners. Between 2001 and 2007, the\n\ncurrent account deficit increased by 56 percent as our demand for imports greatly\n\nexceeded exports. Foreign holdings of total U.S. Treasury debt increased sharply from\n30 percent to 46 percent. Thus, while the United States spent, the rest of the world\n\nsupported our habit. Now we’re in withdrawal, and, yes, it is painfill.\nIn the past two years, household wealth has fallen sharply with declines in house\n\nprices and equity values. For example, homeowners’ equity share of household real\n\nestate has dropped from 55 percent to 45 percent, the lowest value on record. To\nrebalance and rebuild wealth, consumers are now increasing savings and decreasing\nspending. As I said, this is a difficult process, and without offsetting adjustments in other\n\nsectors of the economy, the effect of tills rebalancing is slower growth in real GDP.\n\n\f7\n\nThe Aftermath of Leverage\nIn the first half of 2008, the necessary structural adjustment began gradually.\n\nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent while consumption grew at the slower\n\nrate of 1.0 percent. Over the last several years export growth was strong and the real net\n\nexport deficit decreased. For a while at least it seemed we might come through the\nadjustment relatively well. I certainly thought it was possible.\n\nBut, then, mortgage foreclosure problems worsened. In early 2008, Bear Steams\n\ncollapsed, followed later by a series of liquidity and solvency crises involving the GSEs,\nLehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and AIG. For investors, there was confusion regarding\nhow each was handled and how future problems might finally be resolved. The TARP\n\nwas introduced and changed several tunes as it was being implemented.\n\nThese events added to uncertainty across the economy, and the financial turmoil\nworsened, hr September and October, credit conditions tightened further, and businesses’\n\nand consumers’ confidence seemed to collapse. Indeed, although the early attempts to\n\nstaunch the recession were well-intentioned, it will be a subject of debate for some time\non whether the rush to action might have contributed to the worsening of conditions.\n\nhr the meantime, these developments contributed to the sharp decline of 3.8\npercent in consumption in the third quarter. And for the first time ever, the level of\n\nhousehold debt declined. Based on recent indicators, this decline hi consumption\ncontinued into the fourth quarter and has served to deepen the recession.\n\n\f8\nThe Outlook\n\nThe process of absorbing financial loss, increasing savings and decreasing\nconsumption, the pain of deleveraging, sets the context for the economic outlook. The\nhard fact is that the sharp deterioration of banking and credit conditions, the deepening\n\nslump in consumer and busmess confidence, and the ongoing housing correction must\nwork its way through the economy. While we must do what we can to mitigate the\n\neffects of this deleveraging process, to attempt to avoid its effects entirely is to repeat\n\npast mistakes and may sow the seeds for the next crisis.\n\nAccordingly, my outlook calls for the economy to contract further through much\n\nof 2009 until later in the year when the effects of policy actions begin to stimulate GDP\n\ngrowth.\nStarting with consumption, we will most likely see a contraction at least into the\nsecond quarter. Improvements in both consumption and savings will be hampered by\n\ndeclines in disposable incomes as firms continue to cut costs through layoffs, reductions\n\nof hours and pay cuts. This will be particularly hard felt by households this month when\nthe seasonal jobs during the holiday shopping season come to an end.\n\nThe outlook for business spending is also weak. Conditions in the manufacturing\nsector have worsened, and with this, the decline in corporate profits makes it unlikely that\n\nfnms will expand equipment spending until they see a rebound in consumer demand.\n\nSpending on structures is expected to contract markedly due to tight credit conditions and\nwaning demand for commercial building space.\nOf course, the outlook for residential investment remains weak as well. Housing\nstarts have fallen by 60 percent from peak levels in 2006, and the inventory of existing\n\n\f9\nsingle-family homes remains unusually high at an 11.5-month supply. The increase hi\n\nforeclosure rates in the near term is likely to contribute to additional housing price\ndeclines.\nEven the one recent source of strength for the economy, net exports, is expected\n\nto slow in 2009. After a robust expansion of U.S. exports in the first half of 2008, a rapid\nappreciation of the dollar combined with weakening world demand likely halted the\n\nexpansion of exports in the second half of the year. The recent decline in the dollar\n\nshould reverse this somewhat, but world demand is likely to be weak over the next\nseveral quarters.\n\nGovernment spending at the state and local level is expected to slow as budgets\nare cut hi response to a decline in tax revenues during this downturn. Government\n\nspending at the national level will provide a boost to the economy, depending on the size\n\nand content of the forthcoming stimulus package.\nPutting all of the pieces of the outlook together, the picture for the last quarter of\n\n2008 and at least the first half of this year is grim. The magnitude of the downturn is\n\nlikely to surpass that of the 1990 and 2001 recessions.\n\nWhile this immediate outlook is unsettling, over the longer horizon there is reason\nto expect that we can move through these difficulties and be a stronger economy when\n\nwe emerge from recession. If we pursue systematic policies with the right balance of\nmonetary and fiscal stimulus, the early signs of economic recovery could show\n\nthemselves as early as the third quarter of 2009. It would be foolish to attempt to\n\npinpoint the exact spark for the recovery, but there are important factors that should\n\ncontribute to this result.\n\n\f10\nFirst, the recent sharp decline in oil and gasoline prices does increase consumer\n\ndisposable income by billions of dollars, improve their financial position and serve to\nrestore confidence. Second, while the housing market will continue to struggle, low\nmortgage rates and some decline in inventory will serve to stabilize home prices and\n\nmoderate housing’s extended drag on the economy. Third, a gradual improvement in\n\nfinancial conditions will increase the supply of credit and encourage demand. And\nfinally, expansive monetaiy and fiscal policy will stimulate the economy and serve to\n\noffset some of those factors pulling it down.\nInflation will remain moderate over 2009 and much of 2010. Lower energy and\ncommodity prices along with moderate improvement in demand for goods and services\n\nwill keep price pressures temporarily contained. How prices behave beyond the\nimmediate horizon depends most critically on how the Federal Reseive conducts policy\n\nand manages its expanding balance sheet in a strengthening economy. This is no doubt\n\nthe central bank's most difficult longer-run challenge.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs I already have suggested, the FOMC has responded to the financial and\n\neconomic crisis by steadily cutting the federal funds target rate from 514 percent in\nSeptember 2007 to its current range between 0 and 14 percent.\n\nIn addition, to provide continued support for the functioning of financial markets\n\nand to stimulate the economy, the Board of Governors, under provisions of the Federal\n\nReseive Act, has authorized the creation of several new liquidity facilities and the FOMC\nhas authorized the purchase of large quantities of additional assets for the Reseive Banks\n\n\f11\n\nto hold. The Federal Reserve has stated that with near-term inflation pressures\n\ndiminished, it is prepared to provide expanded liquidity to the markets as needed. Plans\ninclude implementing a loan program to facilitate the extension of credit to consumers\n\nand small busmesses.\n\nThese actions are unprecedented and are a powerfill stimulus to the economy for\n2009, but they come with their own set of risks. First, they are not designed to fix the\n\nproblems withm the financial industry but to go around the problem. They were taken\n\nbecause the intermediation process is broken, and financial institutions are thought to be\nin such a state that they are unable to expand their lending sufficiently to drive the\n\neconomic recovery forward.\n\nAs a result, the Federal Reserve is not only providing liquidity to the financial\n\nindustry, it is also taking on the financial industry’s role as intermediary to business\nfirms. This is a dramatic expansion of the central bank's role in the economy. It is\nreflected most vividly in the combined balance sheet of the 12 Reserve Banks, which has\n\nincreased from $900 billion in mostly Treasury securities in the fall of 2007 to $2.3\n\ntrillion in other assets today, and this will increase still further in the months ahead.\n\nThe Federal Reserve must now manage its balance sheet in a maimer that not only\nplaces liquidity into the economy but also in a manner that does not undermine the long­\n\nterm functioning of markets. It must design an exit strategy that at the appropriate time\nboth removes excess liquidity from the economy and allows it to withdraw as a\n\nsignificant intermediary. Failure to have such a strategy risks undermining an efficient\nfinancial market system.\n\n\f12\nSome of these facilities will automatically dissipate as the market’s intermediation\n\nprocess returns to a more normal state. But the Federal Reserve also will have to\nundertake specific, timely actions if we are to remove the accommodative policy in an\n\neffective manner. The importance of doing this correctly camrot be overemphasized. As\n\nI have suggested, we have sometimes been slow to remove our accommodative policy,\nand hr doing so, we have invited the next round of inflation, excess and crisis.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nFinally, a critical element affectirrg the recovery hr 2009 will be the introduction\n\nof additional fiscal stimulus into the economy. To this point, the current administration\nand Congress have takerr actions to recapitalize banks, and the FDIC has greatly\nexpanded its guarantees of bank liabilities. But these actions might be viewed best as\nholding actions, designed to keep the economy from deteriorating further and faster while\n\nother solutions are developed. The incoming administration’s stimulus package appears\n\nto involve expenditures for both short-term and longer-term projects.\n\nThe cost of the proposed actions is expected to exceed $700 billion and will\nalmost certainly boost the econo my in a time of recession. In the longer run, as we know,\nthis too brings risks that cannot be ignored. It will add to our burden of managing a\n\nrapidly expanding national debt at the same time that we will be confronted with the\n\nlooming obligations from rising Social Security, Medicare and defense expenditures. But\nfor the moment, putting our economy back on its feet is the priority, and with the\nmonetary and fiscal actions that are underway, we should see improvement as we enter\n\nthe second half of 2009.\n\n\f13\n\nConcluding Comments\nIn the end, the greatest challenge that I see for the U.S. economy is not just the\n\nrecession we are now suffering through but how we choose to address it. There are no\n\nshortcuts to stability, no painless methods to adjusting our saving-spending mix and\nreturning to prosperity. We want to successfully get through this difficult deleveraging\n\nprocess, rebuild our national savings and wealth, and we want to do it in a fashion that\ndoes not sow the seeds of the next crisis. As we provide needed liquidity to the financial\nsystem to contain the crisis, we must be careful to build public confidence by assuring\nthat our actions across financial firms are consistent, open, and understandable to the\nmarket and the public. We also must be patient and consider the long run. We must\n\nprovide for an environment of stable prices and manageable debt levels so necessary for\n\nsustainable growth in our national income. If we fail to meet this mandate, we will only\n\nrepeat the cycle of inflation, excess and crisis.\n\n\f"
