Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\n\nJanuary 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon, and a very happy new year to all. It has been a long and unprecedented\nnine months since the COVID-19 pandemic forced Greater Boston to all but shut down last\nMarch. Through December and into early January, the pandemic continues to significantly alter\nour normal ways of living and working. However, we come now to a time of considerable\npromise: as the new year dawns, it seems likely that the public health crisis that has inflicted so\nmuch damage – on individuals, families, businesses, and the economy generally – will dissipate\nover the course of this year. With two highly effective vaccines already starting to be distributed\nin the United States and more in the pipeline – and with medical staff and those most at risk now\nbeing vaccinated – we should see much needed relief for hospitals as we move into the spring.\nAlthough it seems likely to me that the economy will, at best, continue to grow modestly until\nthere is widespread vaccination, I believe a more robust economic recovery – supported by\nexpansionary monetary and fiscal policy – is likely to follow.\nNear-term economic performance is likely to continue to be substantially affected by\npandemic-related challenges. The labor market has stalled as infections have climbed and simple\nself-preservation has forced many people to continue to restrict their activities. Many firms in\nthe service sector remain quite stressed; with restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues likely\nto continue to be materially impacted by the virus, particularly with a new more infectious strain\nreportedly becoming more pervasive.\nIn my view, targeted fiscal policy actions are an appropriate way to support those\nbusinesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic – and the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, recently signed into law, will provide support to many businesses and\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nindividuals that have experienced significant distress. Unfortunately, some states have had to cut\nback on essential services (given their sharp drop in revenue and their balanced-budget rules);\nand the limited financial flexibility of state and local governments is likely to restrain the speed\nof the recovery, similar to what was experienced after the financial crisis of 2007 and ensuing\n“Great Recession.”\nIn addition, it is sobering to note that many of the economic problems caused by the\npandemic have actually been deferred, to date – for example, problems in commercial real estate\nand the bank loans tied to such property are likely to only be fully revealed later this year. These\nfactors, along with the speed of inoculations, will impact how quickly the U.S. economy returns\nto full employment.\nHowever, I am relatively optimistic about the economic outlook for the second half of\n2021. Domestic stock market indices are near all-time highs, suggesting investor confidence in a\nrecovery.1 With very low interest rates, even some financially strapped individuals may be able\nto make payments on debt until incomes are restored (although low interest rates do not solve the\nchallenge of ongoing expenses when there has been an interruption of income).2 The housing\nsector has been helped by low mortgage rates, and the eagerness of many households to transact\nreal estate despite the challenges of the pandemic (and in some cases, because of the pandemic\nand the lifestyle changes it has ushered in). While consumer services remain depressed, the\nconsumer goods sector has recovered nicely and continues to benefit from the broad and\nexpedited movement to online purchasing. Many firms have increased their capital investments,\nas they rely more on technology to conduct business and refit offices to accommodate more\nremote work. For those lucky enough to have the option to work at home, there may be more\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nopportunities to do so going forward, which may be a long-term positive for some, including\nworking parents.\nAs a result, despite the near-term challenges brought on by COVID-19, I am optimistic\nthat we will see significant employment gains over the next two years. However, I do not expect\nthe U.S. economy to reach a sustained 2 percent inflation rate over the same time frame, which\naccording to the guidance the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has\nprovided in its policy statements, implies that policymakers will continue to maintain very\naccommodative short-term rates.\nYet, as I often note, a “low for long” environment does present other important\nchallenges. For example, it encourages firms and individuals to take on more leverage and\nfinancial risk. In addition, many of the financial shocks in March 2020 could have been\nameliorated by proactively addressing problems with money market mutual funds and financial\ninfrastructure before the pandemic hit. If we are to avoid similar problems in the future, my\nview is more needs to be done to make the financial infrastructure of our economy more\nresilient.3\nFinally, and importantly, the disparate economic outcomes we have seen during the\npandemic have further highlighted the problems of income inequality that remain a significant\nchallenge for a strong economy. As I have discussed in recent speeches, policymakers must be\nmindful of the deep pain still occurring in many segments of the economy – particularly for\npersonal-service-related businesses (restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and tourism – for example)\nwhich employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings to cushion against a\ndisruption in wages that lasts for many months. Frequently, these workers are people of color,\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nyoung, or individuals with less educational attainment. Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate\nhas risen the most for these groups.4\n\nThe Near-Term Economic Outlook\nI am looking forward to the time when the outlook for the economy is no longer\nintertwined with that of COVID-19; but unfortunately, that is not yet the case. We continue to\nface an unusually complex employment situation due, in large part, to the uneven response in the\nUnited States to this public health crisis. As I have said in prior talks, I firmly believe that the\npath to stabilizing the economy hinges on first getting the virus under control, and without\neffective public health policy, the virus will remain the major source of economic challenges.5\nFigure 1 shows the rate of COVID infection, scaled by population – for the United\nStates, the European Union, and G-7 countries excluding the U.S. Unfortunately, the figure\nshows that the public health response in this country has been problematic. The U.S. has tended\nto have higher per capita COVID infection rates for much of the past nine months and, relative to\nmany European countries that have managed to gain some control over infection rates through\nlimits on social mobility, the United States now has significantly more infections. This is all the\nmore tragic because these infections are occurring only months before vaccinations will\nsignificantly reduce individuals’ chances of becoming infected.\nWhile infection rates have been high in the U.S., Figure 2 shows that although death\nrates from COVID are quite high, they are roughly similar with that of Europe. For Europe, the\nUnited States, and the G-7 countries excluding the U.S., the death rates among those with\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCOVID are now higher than at any time during the pandemic. The fact that Europe has more\nsubstantially restricted economic activity in response to virus resurgence – and still is seeing very\nhigh death rates – suggests the potential for high economic costs to preventing COVID spread in\nthe near term.\nGiven the high infection and death rates currently seen in the U.S., it is not surprising that\nwe are also observing a softening of economic conditions, in the data. Figure 3 provides the\nfour-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment. Over the last three months, as\nthe pandemic has worsened, the earlier progress reducing the flow of workers into\nunemployment has suffered a setback, with these initial claims for unemployment insurance\nrising somewhat from the end of November and remaining at a very elevated level of 800,000\nclaims. This is consistent with the employment report covering the month of December, released\nlast week, which had unemployment leveling off at 6.7 percent and payroll employment\ndeclining by 140,000.\nHowever, the unemployment rate can be misleading when many people are dropping out\nof the labor force, because it takes into account only those currently seeking work. With many\npeople dropping out of the labor force, data on actual employment can provide a more accurate\nsnapshot of labor market conditions. Figure 4 shows the employment-to-population ratio for the\npast year. When the pandemic first hit, many people were placed on temporary layoff, or\nfurloughed. However, the employment-to-population ratio still shows a large gap relative to prepandemic conditions, reflecting continued elevated numbers of people out of work and also out\nof the labor force.6\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 5 shows the variety of outcomes for payroll employment across industries during\nthe pandemic. Overall, payroll employment is more than 6 percent below the level seen a year\nearlier. Industries such as entertainment, which relies on group gatherings, and personal\nservices, like restaurants, have declined much more than the average for all nonfarm industries.\nThe number of industries that have higher employment than a year ago is limited, but it involves\nwork such as couriers and messengers, and warehousing and storage, as well as building material\nand general merchandise stores – which saw a rise in employment as people worked from, and\nstayed at, home.\nAs shown in Figure 6, some goods that can be consumed at home saw significant\nincreases; including, for example, games and computers. It is important to note that many of\nthese goods are not domestically produced, limiting the employment benefits in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, goods that have been consumed less during the pandemic, when people were largely\nconfined to their homes, include gasoline and cars.\nConsumer services have been more depressed than goods. Figure 7 shows some\nincreases in certain services, such as streaming services and medical laboratories, but there were\nbig declines in many service areas related to travel and entertainment. Many of these depressed\nconsumer services are unlikely to fully recover until widespread vaccination of the population\nhas been achieved.\nOverall, recent indicators suggest near-term problems stemming from elevated infections\nand persistent public health concerns. So clearly, the near-term recovery is highly dependent on\nrapid, widespread vaccination. Unfortunately, to date, the inoculation rate has been\ndisappointing, which likely will impact public health and the economy in the near term.\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA Positive Medium-term Outlook\nAmidst the near-term challenges we face, I will also point out several reasons for\noptimism concerning the economy’s medium-term outlook.\nOne reason to be optimistic is that household saving remains elevated and\naccommodative fiscal policy is likely to further support individuals and firms. Figure 8 shows\nthat the personal saving rate remains quite high, even before the recently enacted additional\nfederal stimulus. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the saving rate was roughly 7.5 percent, and\nmore recently it has been over 12 percent. This suggests that for those whose incomes were not\ninterrupted (for example, those whose jobs were conducive to working from home, and whose\nindustries were not stalled by the pandemic), there is significant capacity to make expenditures\nonce the pandemic is over. Because consumption is such a large part of the economy, in the\nsecond half of the year if vaccinations are widespread, we are likely to see a significant pick up\nin consumption – particularly in the kind of services that consumers have missed during the\npandemic, such as dining in restaurants, traveling, and attending in-person entertainment events.\nA second reason to be optimistic in the medium term is that financial conditions remain\nfavorable, and asset prices have risen significantly since last spring. Figure 9 shows that, despite\nthe substantial decline in stock prices last March as the pandemic took hold, the S&P 500 ended\nthe year roughly 15 percent higher than it was at the beginning of 2020. My view is that highly\naccommodative fiscal and monetary policy will provide a significant tailwind for risky assets this\nyear.\nA third reason to be optimistic is that the housing market has remained quite resilient (in\ncontrast to the last crisis and recession). New and existing single-family home sales plummeted\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nduring the initial COVID lockdown, but recovered over the summer and were more than 20\npercent higher at the end of November than a year prior (Figure 10). While the resurgence in\nthe pandemic has caused a pause in sales, I expect that low interest rates, higher asset prices, and\nmore savings will support continued home purchases in the coming year.\nFigure 11 shows the forecast from the Federal Reserve policymakers’ Summary of\nEconomic Projections, which asks each participant to provide their outlook for the\nunemployment rate over the next three years. My own forecast is somewhat more pessimistic\nthan the consensus in the near term, as a result of the second wave of the pandemic – but does\nanticipate a decline in the unemployment rate once a significant proportion of the population has\nbeen vaccinated.\nIt is important to note that despite my optimism for 2021, there are risks to this outlook.\nThe pandemic is likely to economically scar many individuals and firms. A large number of\nhouseholds have experienced a loss of wealth and employment during the pandemic, and many\nfirms experienced a substantial drop in revenues when they had to shut down. Many businesses\nclosed permanently.\nIn addition, some economic consequences of the pandemic are likely to be revealed only\nwith a lag. A good example is commercial real estate. Figure 12 shows the delinquency of\nloans in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS holdings of commercial real estate).\nSeveral sectors, particularly hotels and retail, are showing delinquencies much higher than even\nduring the severe financial crisis that began in 2007. Most CMBS structures limit the ability to\nwork directly with troubled borrowers, so the problems tend to appear relatively quickly. Similar\nassets held in bank and insurance portfolios have benefited from financial institutions working\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwith many of their borrowers. However, as that forbearance ends, rising nonperforming loans\nare likely to appear by the second half of 2021. This example illustrates that despite the\ngenerally positive outlook for 2021, there are still lingering problems from the pandemic that\nwill likely need to be addressed.\n\nCentral Bank Emergency Support\nA major factor in the resilience of the economy through the pandemic has been the\npresence of significant fiscal and monetary support. Fiscal stimulus from elected officials has\nprovided needed support to businesses and individuals badly impacted by the pandemic.\nMonetary policy has been very supportive as well, as interest rates were immediately reduced to\ntheir lower limit once the pandemic began, in order to enable individuals and businesses to\nborrow very cheaply.7\nOther significant supports came in the variety of emergency lending facilities established\nby the Federal Reserve with the approval of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The New\nYork Reserve Bank operated a number of facilities focused on market functioning, and the\nBoston Reserve Bank operated a facility supporting money market mutual funds. Together,\nthese facilities were important reasons why the financial instability and sharply declining output\nin the spring did not persist through the year.\nIn addition, the Boston Fed administered, on behalf of the Federal Reserve System, a new\ntype of facility during the crisis – the Main Street Lending Program. The program was designed\nto help small- and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations bridge the pandemic\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndownturn.8 The program aimed to assist organizations that might otherwise be in a challenging\nspot – not large enough to have marketable debt that might benefit from the emergency facilities\nfocused on market functioning, but larger than many of the companies utilizing the federal\ngovernment’s Paycheck Protection Program.9\nThe Main Street program is now closed. I am pleased to be able to share some initial\nsummary information on the program with you. This information complements the disclosures\nthe Fed makes on a weekly basis in the H.4.1 statistical release, which includes the net portfolio\nholdings,10 and at 30-day increments per the CARES Act (providing details on Main Street\nProgram loans, last published yesterday, January 11).\nOver 2020, the program extended more than $16.5 billion in lending to over 1,800\ncompanies. As Figures 13 and 14 show, the value and number of loans processed increased\nsignificantly in December. This surge in demand for the program followed the November 19\nannouncement of the decision by the Treasury to not extend CARES Act facilities. It also no\ndoubt reflects the stresses many medium-sized businesses were experiencing at the end of 2020\nas a result of the resurgence of COVID infections.\nI’ll share some summary information and then draw a few conclusions from the data.\n•\n\nWhile Figure 14 shows consistent loan growth from July, it really underlines the\nsurge in demand in December. The program settled just under 650 loans in the\nmonths from July to November, then over 1,150 loans in December alone. Lender\nparticipation also surged in December, with 45 percent of the eventual total pool of\nlenders participating for the first time .\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nAgain, this was quite a surge in demand for Main Street borrowing. On a related side\nnote, I would like to commend everyone at the Fed for their dedication to public\nservice, exhibited by working tirelessly through the month of December to support\nthe increased yearend demand, in an intense effort to meet the needs of program\nparticipants before closure.\n\n•\n\nThe program’s geographic reach was ultimately broad, with settled loans across 49\nstates and two U.S. territories (See Figure 15).\n\n•\n\nLooking at the industries utilizing the program’s loans suggests some unsurprising\nareas of need, given the pandemic’s toll on certain industries where social distancing\nis challenging (See Figure 16). Industrial categories that include food services;\nscientific and technical services; and arts, entertainment, and recreation are the most\nprominent in the Main Street portfolio. Many of these industries reflect what one\nwould expect to be industries disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n\nThe Main Street program proved to be a challenging undertaking for all involved, and\nunfortunately did not meet the needs of everyone who expressed interest; however, my personal\npreference would have been to continue the program through the first half of 2021. The program\nfilled a hole often left unaddressed – support for medium-sized businesses. In my view, there are\nsignificant implications for productivity and industrial organization if only small and large\ncompanies can receive fiscal and lending support during crises.\nAt the same time, while the Main Street lending program provided very helpful\nfinancing, I believe that were certain tweaks permitted, it could have been more impactful. I will\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\noffer a few preliminary observations. First, with less focus on mitigation of potential loss to the\nTreasury, much more credit would have been made available. Second, designing the program to\nhave less legal and operational complexity, and structuring the banks’ role11 differently – for\nexample, as an opportunity to earn fees as long as the loan performed, rather than a 5 percent\nparticipation – may have increased the attractiveness of the program for banks. Finally, longer\nterms and greater ability to refinance would have provided support to medium-sized businesses\nmore akin to what was available to larger companies.\nThe Main Street program was unprecedented, and very challenging, given the fact that\nbusiness loans are not homogeneous and loan participations are difficult to streamline. Still, we\nmust keep in mind the vital importance of credit access, especially to small and medium-sized\ncompanies and nonprofit organizations. If a future crisis compels lawmakers and policymakers\nto want to extend emergency lending to small and medium-sized businesses, through the Fed or\nanother entity, I hope such a program can incorporate the lessons of the Main Street effort and\naddress challenges where possible, so that it is better structured to meet even more firms’ needs.\nDespite the potential for improvements, and its many challenges, the Main Street Lending\nProgram showed the feasibility of marshalling lenders and the public sector to assist hard-toreach businesses – businesses that can survive with the support of a bridge to better times, postdownturn.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, we enter 2021 with some optimism. The pandemic is likely\nto continue to be a problem for public health and the economy until widespread vaccinations take\nhold. Nonetheless, with substantial fiscal and monetary support, I expect a robust recovery\nstarting in the second half of this year. I also expect that short-term interest rates near zero will\nbe appropriate throughout this year, and that the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase longterm assets until the economy is on a stronger economic footing.\nDespite this generally upbeat outlook, my own view is that policymakers must continue\nto find ways to support those individuals and firms that have been disproportionately and\nseverely impacted by the pandemic.\nThank you for having me speak today, and I wish you continued good health in the new\nyear.\n\n1\n\nAnd, potentially, accumulating wealth to complement pent-up demand.\n\n2\n\nIt is worth noting, many low-income individuals lack savings they can rely on, even in good economic times. For\nexample, in 2013, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors introduced an annual survey of the economic well-being\nof U.S. households, which, among other findings, highlighted the so-called ‘$400 problem’ – almost half of\nrespondents at the time could not cover a $400 emergency expense without selling something or borrowing money.\n(For more, see, Attacking the $400 problem on many fronts, Jay Lindsay, Jan. 30, 2019, www.bostonfed.org.)\nAccording to the Board’s most recent survey data, however, Current Report - Update on the Economic Well-Being\nof U.S. Households: July 2020 Results, 70 percent of adult respondents would pay a $400 emergency expense using\ncash or its equivalent, up from 64 percent in April and 63 percent in October 2019.\n3\n\nFor more discussion, see Oct. 8, 2020 remarks by Eric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nYale Economic Development Symposium,\nhosted by the Yale School of Management’s\nEconomic Development Club\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for inviting me to address the Yale Economic\nDevelopment Symposium. The theme of this gathering, rebuilding an inclusive economy, is\nhighly relevant to the current moment, and is central to many policy discussions. I am pleased to\nbe able to offer my own perspectives with you today on this important topic.\nThe most recent policy statement from the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-setting Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) noted how “the ongoing public health crisis continues to\nweigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the\neconomic outlook.” 1 Indeed, the impact of COVID-19 has been extraordinary, damaging\nindividuals, families, businesses, and the economy overall. And the disparate economic\noutcomes for some individuals and groups during the pandemic have further exacerbated longstanding issues in our economy.\nFortunately, vaccine distribution across the United States is underway – and while not as\nseamless a rollout as any of us would have hoped, the vaccines represent a very promising\ndevelopment. Although COVID-19 infection rates have recently declined, they remain at a\nrelatively high level. While it seems likely that the economy will continue to grow despite this\nelevated infection rate, a more rapid pace of economic activity will be realized only when there\nare widespread inoculations. Indeed, a successful vaccination rollout by the middle of the\nsummer suggests that by the second half of this year a robust economic recovery should be\nunderway – supported by the current accommodative stance of both monetary and fiscal policy.\nToday, I will first focus on the outlook for the U.S. economy, including some discussion\nof economic conditions in Connecticut. The uneven nature of this downturn has highlighted the\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nneed to rebuild the economy in a more inclusive way. I will suggest some development policies\nthat I believe will help complement the traditional macro policy responses, to build a more\nequitable economy.\nOver the past several months, economic trends have largely been determined by the path\nof the virus and the resulting health policy responses. I expect, unfortunately, that the evolution\nof the virus will continue to determine the course of the economy through the middle of the year,\nas the U.S. and our trading partners continue to grapple with the continually evolving public\nhealth crisis.\nI will emphasize today that the pandemic has had significantly divergent impacts on\ndifferent industries and workers, leading to very different economic outcomes across different\nsegments of the population. The sectors most impacted by social distancing, due to significant\ncustomer-facing interaction – recreation, entertainment, retail, restaurants, travel, and hotels – are\nalso large employers of workers who receive relatively low wages. Many of the employees\nworking in these sectors are Black or Hispanic. In addition, many are women and many are\nyounger workers. As a result, these segments of the population have suffered disproportionately\nduring the pandemic.\nIn contrast, Americans with jobs that can be performed remotely, although certainly\nconstrained by the pandemic, have been able to continue working – albeit from home. As a\nresult, certain segments of the economy – those where working at a computer or over the phone\nis feasible – allow these businesses to be conducted from socially distanced locations, largely\nuninterrupted. In fact, this evolution in the way we work and collaborate might have long-lasting\neffects on the workplace of the future. There are also some goods-producing industries where\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproduction lines can achieve some social distancing, and these industries have flourished. Many\nof the workers in minimally affected jobs have found themselves saving more money as the\npandemic limits spending on travel, entertainment, and other things.\nGiven this added savings, we should see a significant increase in demand for many of the\nactivities that have been limited by social distancing once consumers no longer feel threatened\nby the virus. Of course, this requires that public health officials can successfully vaccinate a\nlarge share of the population, and that the vaccinations continue to keep up with new variants of\nthe virus.\nDespite a potentially difficult road ahead over the next few months, monetary policy is\nquite accommodative, and fiscal policy has been and likely will continue to be forcefully\ndeployed. From my perspective, both the monetary and fiscal policy responses have been quite\nappropriate, given the severity of the public-health-induced economic crisis. 2\nPerhaps, however, it is not enough to focus solely on the macroeconomic response to the\npandemic. The recovery provides us a unique opportunity to ensure that the economic rebuilding\nprocess advances a more inclusive economy. Indeed, the pandemic has highlighted the critical\nimportance of finding ways to improve workforce development, increase workplace flexibility,\nand revitalize areas where many low-income workers reside.\nA number of programs can continue to make a difference along these dimensions. I will\nfocus today on initiatives that are improving child care, improving the quality of jobs, and\nproviding additional financing targeted to those communities most impacted by the pandemic.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nFigure 1 highlights the scope of the tragic effects of the COVID-19 virus. For the U.S.\nas a whole (the blue line), deaths per million of population late last year surpassed the\ncomparable number reached last spring, during the early stages of the pandemic, and remain\nelevated. In Connecticut (the green line), the death rate per million of population is substantially\nlower than in the spring, but still not much different from the national average. The persistent\nseverity of the pandemic continues to limit individuals’ willingness to venture much beyond their\nown residence, with many people preferring to shelter at home while waiting for the supply of\nvaccines to catch up with demand.\nMobility data – which is measured by cell-phone-based data on foot traffic to over 5\nmillion points of interest – capture how individuals’ movements have been altered by social\ndistancing. As Figure 2 shows, for the U.S. and Connecticut, government mandated restrictions\nlast spring meant that many individuals either chose to curtail their visits to restaurants and to\nestablishments involved in non-essential retail (for instance, discretionary shopping) or were\nforced to, because the establishments were shut down. As the distancing restrictions reduced\ninfection rates, mandates were relaxed, and there was a significant pick-up in visits to restaurants\nand stores.\nHowever, as we approached winter and the second wave of infections swelled, many\nstates that had scaled back restrictions saw infections and deaths rise once again, with people\nreducing their mobility accordingly. Mobility in Connecticut data has largely mirrored the\nnational trends. And the weaker economic data that we have seen for the end of last year are\nconsistent with the reduced mobility.\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nNote that the reaction to the even more severe second wave – in terms of reduced\nmobility – is, in part, more modest than the reaction to the initial wave last spring, as firms and\nconsumers have adapted to the constraints imposed by the virus. High-frequency spending data,\nshown in Figure 3, highlight that spending fell dramatically in the spring and has remained\ndepressed for the spending categories that are most impacted by social distancing. 3 However,\nconsumers have substituted goods that can be delivered to the home for services that require\nleaving the house. The right side of the chart shows data for Connecticut; the series are\nsomewhat different as they are changes in spending per transaction rather than changes in total\nspending. The data show a similar pattern to the U.S., with depressed spending on social\ndistance-sensitive segments relative to all other spending. While social distance-sensitive\nspending started to rebound as cases declined in the late spring and summer, it retreated as cases\nrose again.\nConsistent with the spending data, we have seen sharp fluctuations in employment,\nparticularly in industries most affected by social distancing, shown in Figure 4. There were\ndramatic declines in payroll employment in the spring, some recovery during the summer, and\nfurther declines at the end of last year. Not surprisingly, the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\ncategory shows the biggest decline, with many businesses in this segment of the economy still\nbeing restricted by limits on congregating. Employment in Connecticut in these sectors, shown\non the right side of the figure, has largely mirrored that of the nation.\nFigure 5 shows the change in employment from February 2020 through January of this\nyear, for the U.S. as a whole. Even though employment has generally been expanding since\nMay, given the sharp declines in payroll employment in these industries last March and April,\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwe remain well below the employment levels we saw roughly one year ago. Unfortunately,\nbecause of the composition of the workforce in many of these industries, Black and Hispanic\nworkers have borne a disproportionate share of the pain.\nTo capture the extent of the differences in labor market outcomes across segments of the\npopulation, Figure 6 focuses on a broader measure of labor market slack, the U-6 measure of\nunemployment. As well as including people unemployed and actively looking for work, the U-6\nmeasure also encompasses people who are working part time for economic reasons and persons\nwho are marginally attached to the labor force. By this broader U-6 measure, labor market\noutcomes for Blacks and Hispanics since last February have been significantly worse than for\nWhite workers. Note, however, that race is not the only distinguishing feature of how the\npandemic has impacted the workforce. Figure 7 shows that younger workers have also suffered\ndisproportionately, with the U-6 measure for younger workers roughly double that of older\nworkers. These race and age patterns in unemployment are not uncommon during a recession\nand the early stages of a recovery, but they are nevertheless important to highlight if as a society\nwe want to achieve more equitable outcomes.\nWomen in the workforce have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic as\nwell. While a U-6 measure by gender would not show a dramatically different experience for\nmen and women, other measures highlight the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on\nwomen. Figure 8 shows the labor force participation rate for men and women by age\ncategories. Overall, the labor force participation rate for women has fallen by more than that for\nmen. The differential is more pronounced by age category. For the younger age groups,\nwomen’s labor force participation rates have fallen by over a full percentage point more than\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmen’s labor force participation. The younger age categories are those where families might have\nchild care issues during the pandemic which could cause a parent, likely a woman, to leave the\nlabor force.\nA closer examination of labor market outcomes in the pandemic also reveals differences\nin the type of unemployment. Figure 9 shows that temporary layoffs have been much more\nprevalent than during previous downturns (they are shown in the dark blue area at the base of the\nfigure). 4 Figure 10 shows that the industries that account for much of the significant rise in\ntemporary layoffs have been those most impacted by social distancing – such as leisure and\nhospitality. While temporary layoffs would normally come with the expectation of being\nrehired, perhaps quickly, such an expectation reflects in part that temporary layoffs in the past\noften involved large firms that were likely to recall workers once demand started to recover. 5\nIndeed, Figure 11 shows that roughly 30 percent of temporary layoffs currently involve workers\nwho have been on layoff for 27 or more weeks. Though temporary layoffs have fallen\ndramatically from their peak of over 18 million workers, to just under 3 million workers, there\nare worrying possibilities to consider. To the extent that many of these nominally temporary\nlayoffs are occurring at relatively small firms, whose reopening status is uncertain, the transition\nback to employment for these remaining temporary unemployed workers may be more difficult\nthan in previous recessions – unless the recovery is exceptionally strong or policy relief\nimmediate.\nFortunately, macroeconomic policies have been forceful since the start of the pandemic.\nThe federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate that the Federal Reserve targets, has been\nbetween 0 and 25 basis points since March, and as the January 27 FOMC statement indicated,\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFed policymakers expect this level to persist until the committee’s stated 2 percent inflation\ntarget has been reached. The Federal Reserve is also continuing its purchases of Treasury and\nmortgage-backed (MBS) securities, which makes it easier and less expensive for individuals and\nfirms to borrow at longer horizons. These purchases will continue until there is substantially\nmore progress in lowering unemployment and raising inflation.\nImportantly, fiscal policy is the most effective option when monetary policy has reached\nthe lower effective bound for interest rates. Fiscal policymakers have already taken significant\naction, and further actions are under discussion in Washington. To my eye, policymakers have\nreacted aggressively to the current pandemic-driven economic situation and appear prepared to\ncontinue with additional fiscal and monetary policy actions as needed in order to avoid further\nimpairment of labor markets and the economy as a whole.\n\nCommunity Development Actions\nWhile improving near-term public health and macroeconomic conditions are critically\nimportant, my own view is that policymakers should also take the time, as we rethink so many\nthings coming out of the pandemic, to resolve some of the problems that have been brought to\nthe forefront over the past year. “Essential employees,” for instance, have always been essential,\nbut the prevalence of COVID-19 has made the challenges faced by that segment of the\nworkforce more apparent. Indeed, we have been frequently reminded anew that these workers\nprovide services that all of us need to survive.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne example is illustrated in Figure 12, which looks at income levels and the\ncomposition of service workers in New England prior to the pandemic. The low-wage nature of\nservice jobs is clear as 35 percent of service workers have family income less than 200 percent of\nthe Federal Poverty Level, compared with 20 percent among workers overall. And, a larger\nshare of service workers rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to\nfeed their families despite having a job. And finally, it shows that Hispanics in particular hold a\ndisproportionate share of these jobs. Moreover, many of these jobs did not come with benefits\npackages.\nParticularly striking is the disparity in access to any form of health insurance coverage for\nnon-health care essential workers in New England at the onset of the pandemic, shown in Figure\n13. While 7.7 percent of White essential workers were uninsured, 10.5 percent of Black\nessential workers and 13.6 percent of Hispanic essential workers did not have health insurance.\nIn addition, essential workers who have health insurance often face the challenging prevalence of\nhigh-cost, high-deductible plans. Along with health insurance, there is a need for safe workplace\nenvironments, with employers investing sufficiently to protect their employees. The rethinking\nof the workplace that will come as we move beyond the pandemic should also redouble thinking\non safety, broadly speaking – along with the public health benefits that may accrue from better\naccess to primary care, medical visits, and sick leave.\nWe should all remember that prior to the pandemic, a major concern of employers across\nNew England was filling job openings in very tight labor markets. At the same time, in my visits\nto many New England locales – including, for example, East Hartford, Connecticut – potential\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkers noted the impediments created by inflexible job characteristics that limited their ability\nto participate in the workforce.\nIn the economics field, we often focus on the need for workers to have sufficient skills to\nmatch the needs of employers. Indeed, a worker’s investment in education and in other workrelated skills can have a significant impact on wages and on the likelihood of holding onto a job\nin an economic downturn. But as Figure 14 illustrates, the other side of the equation is\nimportant; employers can and should consider how to tweak or tailor jobs to the workforce they\ncan attract and need to attract. Features that raise “job quality” can be a win not only for\nworkers, but also for employers seeking to attract and retain talent. In particular, finding ways to\nadapt or alter regular hours so that workers can more easily commute and deal with child care or\nelder care could make a big difference toward the goal of raising labor force participation –\nespecially if coupled with more significant benefits that include health insurance, sick and family\nleave, and taking advantage of technology to allow working from home when appropriate.\nOther actions may require more partnerships between employers and government. The\npandemic has left many families struggling with remote schooling and a lack of child care\noptions. Many parents have made difficult family and financial decisions to provide for the\nneeds of their children during the pandemic, with some choosing (at least temporarily) to exit the\nworkforce. I believe we can do more as a nation to make sure these parents can return to the\nworkforce even after the pandemic has subsided. These solutions, however, will require creative\nthinking, and employer and government support for affordable, quality child care – which\ncontinues to be an issue for so many families – and early childhood education. Absent such an\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neffort, many individuals will continue to be held back from participating in the labor market,\nwith negative repercussions for the economy as a whole.\nFinally, one of the challenges during the pandemic has been maintaining momentum to\nadvance important economic development goals in an economic context that has changed\nconsiderably. Prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had been working with\na number of cities and rural communities around New England to provide collaborative solutions\nto community problems through our Working Places initiative. 6\nHere in Connecticut, for instance, the effort involves a partnership between the Boston\nFed, the state, members of the private sector and philanthropic communities, and five\nConnecticut cities. The program consists of a three-year grant funding competition designed to\nstrengthen civic infrastructure in the participating communities by supporting teams of leaders\ncollaborating across sectors on shared economic goals, an approach supported by Boston Fed\nresearch. 7 The cities of Danbury, East Hartford, Hartford, Middletown, and Waterbury are\nworking on a variety of efforts geared toward systemic change, engaging residents, addressing\nracial equity, and learning and adapting to build a more inclusive and equitable local economy\nfor their residents (Figure 15).\nWhile the work is not yet completed, we have already seen many cities achieving the\nmilestones they set out for themselves. This sort of cross-sector collaboration at the state and\nlocal level is, in my view, critical to our ability to rebuild for a more inclusive economy set up\nfor more widespread prosperity, better business conditions, and more resilient long-term growth.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe past year with the pandemic has been grueling. Eleven months after the initial\noutbreak, economic outcomes for individuals and businesses still remain closely tied to finding\nand implementing effective public health policy. However, with the successful development of\nmultiple vaccines, it is now possible to imagine much better macroeconomic outcomes ahead. 8\nMy view is that policymakers must work to ensure that the benefits of the eventual recovery are\nwidely shared.\nAs I’ve mentioned, I believe that as we think about recovery from the pandemic, we\nshould take the time to look for ways that our economy can be reimagined for the better with\nwhat we have learned during this trying period. We should learn from the challenges that the\npandemic brought to the forefront – but were simmering even before COVID-19. And we\nshould capitalize on the opportunities that stem from realizing new ways of working and extend\nthem more broadly to benefit more workers – especially those in low- and moderate-wage\noccupations – along with employers, industries, and local economies.\nThank you for having me, and I wish you all continued good health in 2021.\n\nSee Jan. 27, 2021 FOMC statement:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210127a.htm.\n\n1\n\nIt is worth noting that this strong fiscal and monetary policy response is needed, in part, because the public health\nresponse was not as forceful as it needed to be.\n\n2\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M.

United States figures are total spending by category.\nConnecticut figures are credit card spending per transaction by category by residents living in Connecticut.\n3\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines people on temporary layoff as people who have been given a\ndate to return to work or who expect to return to work within 6 months.\n\n4\n\nBecause the aggregate temporary layoffs displayed in Figure 8 are seasonally adjusted whereas the figures by\nindustry displayed in Figure 9 are not, there is a difference in the pattern for the most recent data. The emphasis in\nFigure 9 is not on the trend but on the composition of layoffs.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFor more about Working Places, see: https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n\nFor more discussion of the research on which the Working Places initiative is based, see: Lessons from Resurgent\nCities - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n7\n\nFor more discussion, see Jan. 12, 2021, talk by Eric S.

U.S. Eastern Time on\nMonday, April 12, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Taking Stock of the Economic Recovery and the\nOpportunities to Bolster Financial Stability”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNewton-Needham Regional Chamber\nApril 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to join you today. As we gather today,\nimprovements on the public health front, coupled with fiscal and monetary policy actions, make\nthis a hopeful time to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy.\nDespite continuing concerns with COVID-19 variants, which have contributed to\ninfection rates still being elevated, over one-third of Americans have already received at least\none dose of vaccine, and the economy is beginning to show signs of recovering from the\ndevastating effects of the pandemic.\nEven with this relatively positive public-health outlook, policymakers must be mindful\nthat many businesses and households continue to experience significant economic distress\nbrought on by the pandemic. The effects have, unfortunately, fallen disproportionately on lowerwage workers in industries where social distancing and remote work are difficult – segments of\nthe workforce that include many Black and Hispanic workers. Women and younger workers\nhave also suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. With economic recovery in sight, we\nshould focus on creating a more inclusive economy in which opportunities are widely shared.1\nThere are a number of signs that the economy is recovering, starting with the recent\nemployment report. The employment report for March illustrates the strength of the recovery,\nwith payroll employment growing by over 900,000 jobs. However, the U.S. unemployment rate\nis still elevated, at 6 percent, and many workers and firms impacted by social distancing\nrequirements (or continued consumer fears, at least for the time being) are still struggling.\nAssuming vaccines remain effective against new variants of the virus, the U.S. economy should\nexperience a significant rebound this year, propelled by highly accommodative monetary and\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfiscal policy, and significant pent-up demand from consumers and firms whose ability to spend\nhas been restrained by the pandemic.\nAt the March meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policy-making body, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), the median projection of participants for real GDP growth for 2021\nwas 6.5 percent, with the unemployment rate expected to finish the year more than 2 percentage\npoints lower (i.e., better) than at the end of 2020. Many private forecasters expect particularly\nstrong consumption growth this year, fueled by fiscal stimulus payments and the easing of\nrestrictions that have limited consumers’ ability to spend on certain leisure and entertainment\nservices. As people become vaccinated, domestic travel is likely to pick up. Indeed, airlines,\nhotels, and restaurants that were particularly hard hit over the past year are already showing\nevidence of recovery in high-frequency spending data.\nDespite this very strong forecast, I expect a return of the economy to pre-pandemic levels\nwill likely take longer than many private forecasters expect. With labor-market slack still\nsignificant, and inflation still below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, my perspective is that\nthe current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate.\nCertainly everyone hopes that we quickly return to an economy with tighter labor\nmarkets and a significant improvement in many of the sectors of the economy hardest hit by the\npandemic. A strong labor market and a return to in-person schooling, for instance, would make\nit easier for parents who left the job market last year to care for children (a dynamic that\ndisproportionately involved female workers), to reenter the labor force and find a job. I expect\nthat over the next couple of years, we will see the unemployment rate falling back to prepandemic levels, with significantly improved labor force participation rates.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe current accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy should help return the\neconomy to full employment much faster than in the previous downturn. Indeed, the Federal\nReserve’s revised monetary policy framework puts an emphasis on seeing economic evidence\n(for example, of higher inflation) before shifting the stance of policy.\nOf course, the Fed seeks to avoid a prolonged slow recovery such as the one that\nfollowed the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ensuing Great Recession.2 Nonetheless, it is\nimportant to acknowledge that running a so-called “hot” economy for a prolonged period is not\nwithout risks, as I have discussed many times in recent years. As I will discuss today, it arguably\nfactored into some of the challenges to financial stability that emerged at the start of the\npandemic. Going forward, such issues should be addressed to limit financial markets’ potential\nto amplify the effects of adverse economic outcomes in the future. Today, I will focus on three\nsuch risks.\n•\n\nFirst, I will highlight that in the last two downturns (the episodes beginning in 2007 and\n2020), prime and tax-exempt money market funds experienced rapid, large outflows of\nfunds, which badly disrupted short-term credit markets. (This necessitated emergency\nlending facilities, which were administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on\nbehalf of the Federal Reserve System.) I will also highlight risks in certain open-end\nmutual funds.\n\n•\n\nSecond, many financial firms experienced a liquidity squeeze that led to a wave of sales\nof usually liquid Treasury securities, badly disrupting the Treasury market which is the\ncornerstone of the U.S. bond market.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nAnd third, I will share my view that extensive forbearance for borrowers and banks was\nnecessary to continue the flow of bank credit.\n\nThe factors underlying these financial market stresses, in my view, must be addressed – to avoid\na future repeat of the issues the economy experienced at the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nFor the past year, economic forecasts have been intertwined with projections of COVID19 infections and mortality, which were reflected in many of the movements of higher-frequency\nmobility and spending data. Today, I am pleased to focus for a moment on a more optimistic\npicture – vaccination rates. As Figure 1 shows, in the U.S., 33 percent of the population have\nreceived at least a first dose of the vaccine. Here in New England, the rollout of vaccinations has\nbeen better than in many parts of the country, with all six New England states among the states\nwith the highest percentage of residents who have received at least one shot.\nIn contrast, as the figure shows, Europe has had difficulty obtaining a sufficient vaccine\nsupply, and then getting that supply to people, at a time when variants of the virus are\nunfortunately proving more contagious. This has caused several European countries to once\nagain confront rising infection rates with increased restrictions on social mobility. Without these\npolicies hospitals would again become strained and deaths would rise. The problem is even\nworse in many third-world countries, where there is little to no domestic vaccine production, and\nvaccine costs are prohibitively high.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 2 shows that as the vaccination rollout in the U.S. has improved since the\nbeginning of the year, FOMC participants have upgraded their outlook for GDP, as reported in\nthe Summary of Economic Projections, which is a collection of economic projections made by\nFed policymakers four times a year. Passage of the large fiscal stimulus also played a role.\nSpecifically, between the December projections and the March projections, the median GDP\ngrowth forecast for this year has risen by more than 2 percentage points.\nThis optimism appears to also be shared by private-sector forecasters. Figure 3 reports\nthe four most recent GDP forecasts from the Blue Chip Survey (which polls roughly 50 privatesector economic forecasters). Many of the Blue Chip forecasters have upgraded their forecast of\nhow quickly the economy will recover. Passage of fiscal stimulus also played a role. Between\nJanuary and April, these private forecasters have increased their forecast for economic growth,\nparticularly in the first half of the year.\nFigure 4 provides a sense of the distribution of the Blue Chip forecasts. The average of\nthe 10 forecasters with the highest growth rate are expecting GDP growth in excess of 10\npercent. The average of the 10 forecasters with the lowest growth rate still exceeds 3 percent\nthrough this year.\nThe rapid projected growth in GDP is similarly reflected in expectations for significant\nimprovements in the labor market. Figure 5 shows the unemployment rate forecast from the\nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. From September to March, FOMC participants\nhave been lowering their estimate of the path of unemployment as they raised their estimated\npath of GDP growth. Over that six-month period, with substantially more fiscal spending than\nestimated last September and better vaccination outcomes than expected at the end of 2020,\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nparticipants have reduced their forecast of unemployment for the end of this year by 1 percentage\npoint, with declines in forecasts for subsequent years also substantial. Figure 6 shows that the\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast follows a similar pattern – but starting from a slightly\nhigher level, ends at a slightly higher level than the SEP, despite a slightly less gradual decline in\n2022.\nFOMC participants have also been increasing their estimates for core PCE inflation,\nshown in Figure 7. The most recent forecast, shown as squares, has core inflation somewhat\nexceeding 2 percent in 2021 and 2023. The average core inflation rate for the Blue Chip\nforecasters is roughly in line with the Summary of Economic Projections from FOMC\nparticipants. However, as Figure 8 shows, the range of Blue Chip survey forecasts is quite large\nbetween the average of the 10 highest inflation forecasts and the average of the 10 lowest\ninflation forecasts.\nAs the economy returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation, the median FOMC\nparticipant expectation is that short-term interest rates will remain close to zero through 2023, as\nis shown in Figure 9. Note that during most previous economic recoveries, forecasts of\nreturning to full employment at the target inflation rate would have been accompanied by\nexpectations of gradual increases in interest rates. However, with the revised monetary policy\nframework adopted by the FOMC, monetary policymakers can be more patient and wait for\nmore tangible signs that inflation has increased, rather than just forecasts, before starting to raise\nrates.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Employment Report\nTurning to the labor markets, the most recent data on employment are quite consistent\nwith an economy beginning to expand from the constraints of the pandemic. Figure 10 shows\nthat after a pandemic-related slowdown at the end of last year, payroll employment has been\nincreasing. In March alone, more than 900,000 new jobs were created.\nFigure 11 shows that some of the growth in jobs has been in industries that had been\nstrongly impacted, initially, by the pandemic and the need for social distancing. Leisure and\nhospitality employment, which declined during the second wave of the pandemic at the end of\nlast year and the beginning of this year, has since been rising – though employment still remains\nwell below levels seen prior to the pandemic. If one looks at total employment not including\nleisure and hospitality, jobs have been increasing gradually, but still remain somewhat below\ntheir pre-pandemic levels.\nOther indications of the continued strains on the labor market as a result of the pandemic\nare the changes in the labor force participation rates for prime working age men and women,\nshown in Figure 12. With many schools either in a remote or hybrid learning mode, many\nparents have left the workforce to provide support for their children. Those who leave the labor\nforce are not counted as unemployed, even though some of them would nevertheless prefer to be\nworking if the childcare situation were different and job conditions were better. In this respect,\nreduced labor force participation represents a concerning development. While labor force\nparticipation has been improving of late, it is still well below the participation rate we saw before\nthe pandemic.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGiven the challenges in the labor market, fiscal and monetary policy are unusually\nstimulative, with the hope that the economic recovery will be much faster than the one following\nthe Great Recession. As Figure 13 shows, five years after the 2008 recession, the\nunemployment rate was still close to 8 percent. Of course the nature of the 2020 shock was very\ndifferent, as was the condition of banks this time, but with a much more aggressive monetary and\nfiscal policy response and the rapid development of vaccines, the unemployment rate has already\nfallen much more quickly this time. And as I previously showed, FOMC participants expect that\nthe unemployment rate will decline to just under 4 percent within two years.\n\nSome Risks to the Economic Outlook\nWhile there are downside risks to economic activity from potential COVID-19 virus\nvariants, risks to the upside are also present, as the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus is\nmuch greater now than in previous cycles. These upside risks could, in turn, pose some financial\nstability risks when the next recession occurs. As I mentioned earlier, my view is that other\nremaining risks are the structural ones that contributed to the financial market disruptions that\noccurred when the pandemic began last year.3\nThe first of the three structural risks I see relates to short-term credit markets, which, in\nthe past two recessions, have been disrupted by runs on prime and tax-exempt money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). Figure 14 shows the run on prime funds as a sharp reduction in assets\nunder management, in 2008 and in 2020. These funds invest in relatively high-quality, shortterm credit instruments, which can experience liquidity problems if investors pull their money\nfrom the money funds quickly, forcing the funds to sell relatively illiquid assets into distressed\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmarkets. Figure 15 depicts that problem, showing that in both 2008 and 2020, such selling into\ndistressed markets caused a spike in the spread above the Fed Funds rate for highly rated, assetbacked commercial debt. Other indicators of funding market stress also spiked during both\nepisodes, including those for short-term municipal debt.\nSimply put, prime and tax-exempt MMMFs should not need emergency lending facilities\nas they did in the financial crisis that began in 2007, and more recently at the onset of the\npandemic. Unlike prime and tax-exempt funds, government MMMFs (which invest in shortterm U.S. Treasury and agency securities and private debt fully collateralized by such\ninstruments) did not experience the same problems – rather, government funds experienced large\ninflows. One potential solution would be to require prime and tax-exempt MMMFs to convert to\nsuch government funds.4\nI should mention that the pandemic also shed a light on the remaining structural\nvulnerabilities in open-end mutual funds (MFs), particularly corporate debt MFs, which allow\ndaily redemptions, notwithstanding the liquidity of their underlying assets.5 A potential\nremedial action would be to require all MFs to adopt swing pricing, which is currently\nvoluntary.6 A properly calibrated swing pricing system could reduce investors’ incentives to run,\nas it would force them to at least partially bear the cost of their redemptions, without\ndisadvantaging those investors choosing to remain in the fund. Alternatively, measures that\nmatch a MF’s redemption frequency to the liquidity profile of its underlying holdings are worth\nexploring.\nA second risk that came into view at the onset of the pandemic involved a “dash for\nliquidity,” in which a variety of entities, seeking to bolster their liquidity positions, sold large\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nvolumes of U.S. Treasury securities. However, the infrastructure for buying and selling U.S.\nTreasury securities relies primarily on broker-dealers and could become strained if unusually\nlarge volumes of Treasury securities are being sold, as was the case in March. One possible\nsolution would be to create a structure less reliant on broker-dealers’ balance sheets to maintain\nliquid markets for these securities. One way this could be done is by creating expanded central\nclearing mechanisms for Treasury securities and the financing of Treasury securities.\nA third risk that became apparent early in 2020 was the concern that banks would\nconstrict credit, potentially exacerbating the economic downturn. A variety of regulatory relief\nproposals were adopted, including greater forbearance for borrowers, encouragement to utilize\ncapital buffers, and a relaxation of some of the prevailing capital requirements.7 In addition,\nbanks were asked to stop share repurchases and limit dividend payments until it was clear that\ntheir capital was sufficient to weather the recession brought on by the pandemic. While these\nmeasures were needed at the time, and thus appropriate, in my view they reflect a capital regime\nthat is not sufficiently flexible during economic downturns. Investors in banks, and bank\nmanagement teams, would prefer to avoid the attendant uncertainty around capital planning, and\nbank regulators would prefer to not suspend bank regulations in economic downturns.\nA solution to this problem is to provide a Countercyclical Capital Buffer, or CCyB, that\ngets built up during economic recoveries, but is expected to be drawn down during economic\ndownturns. Rather than disrupt bank capital planning and rely on temporary relief from capital\nregulations, the CCyB provides a “shock absorber” that, if appropriately implemented, would\nallow borrower financing to continue without these temporary extraordinary and less predictable\nmeasures.8\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA policy that runs a “hot” economy could pose other financial stability challenges, as I\nhave discussed in previous speeches. However, my view is that these three structural risks seem\nthe most immediate to address in an effort to avoid a repeat of the financial problems\nexperienced at the outset of the pandemic.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIt seems likely that the economy will grow rapidly this year. This should reduce the slack\nin the labor markets and eventually return inflation to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nAssuming virus variants do not become especially problematic, we should see an unusually\nstrong post-recession recovery.\nWhile the near-term public health and macroeconomic improvements are more than\nwelcome and critically important, I also believe that policymakers across the spectrum should\ntake the time to examine some of the problems brought to the forefront over the past year. In\ndoing so, they can help to ensure we are rebuilding an economy that works for all Americans\nthroughout the inevitable business cycle.\nThe combination of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and consumers and firms\nwell positioned to renew spending, should result in returning to full employment much more\nquickly than after the last financial crisis and Great Recession. However, many of the\nunderlying problems that can disrupt financial stability – as at the outset of the pandemic – still\nneed to be addressed. During the economic recovery, policymakers should be diligent about\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nremoving these risks to financial stability, which translate into risks for the economy and every\nfirm and worker in it.\nThank you for having me speak today, and best wishes for good health and economic\nrecovery in the months ahead.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Feb. 19, 2021, talk by Eric S. Rosengren entitled: Perspectives on the Eventual Economic\nRecovery.\n2\n\nFor more discussion of the changes to the framework, see: Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\n3\n\nFor more discussion, see Oct. 8, 2020, remarks by Eric S. Rosengren, entitled Economic Fragility: Implications for\nRecovery from the Pandemic, and also Jan. 12, 2021, remarks entitled, The Economic Outlook – Optimism Despite\nthe Challenges Ahead.\n4\n\nSome MMMF sponsors have converted their prime funds into government funds. For example, Vanguard, noting\nthe “…rewards of even the most conservatively managed prime funds are no longer worth the risk,” reorganized its\nprime money market fund into a government fund. See: Vanguard, Aug. 2020, Vanguard Announces Changes to\nMoney Market Fund Lineup.\nPolicymakers have highlighted “liquidity transformation” risks as a vulnerability arising from the MF structure.\nSuch funds offer daily redemptions, irrespective of the liquidity profile of their holdings. The key concern is that\nheavy investor redemptions would force MFs to liquidate assets at “fire sale prices,” which could impact other\nfinancial markets. Last March, corporate and municipal bond MFs experienced significant redemptions, which\nlikely contributed to strains in bond markets during that period.\n5\n\nA fund that adopts swing pricing will reduce (increase) its price per share by a pre-established “factor” if net\nredemptions (purchases) exceed a certain threshold. We are not aware of any U.S. MF that has adopted swing\npricing. In contrast, swing pricing is widely used in Europe, and some research suggests it reduces redemptions\nduring periods of stress. See, for example: Dunhon et al, Nov. 2019, Swing Pricing and Fragility in Open-Ended\nMutual Funds, International Monetary Fund Working Paper.\n6\n\n7\n\nTo be more specific, easing of the leverage ratio for the largest firms and adjusting the CBLR requirement for\nsome small banks.\n8\n\nFor additional discussion of the CCyB and other financial stability policy tools, see March 23, 2018, remarks at the\nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy by Eric S. Rosengren, Monetary, Fiscal,\nand Financial Stability Policy Tools: Are We Equipped for the Next Recession?\n\n12\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time on\nWednesday, May 5, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Pandemic Ebbs and Flows: Economic Data, Inflation\nConcerns, and Policymaking”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston College Carroll School of Management\nWebinar on Post-Pandemic Trajectories\nMay 5, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. Even though this event is being held virtually, it is wonderful to be with\nthe Boston College community today. Thank you for inviting me to participate in this webinar\nseries, focused on aspects of life after the COVID pandemic. Clearly, we have all learned a great\ndeal during this extremely difficult period. Now, as we contemplate and work towards a\nrecovery – in both public health and the economy – it is important to keep learning, to continue\napplying those lessons even after the crises fade, and to keep analyzing data and policy options\nwith rigor – and without overreacting to the inevitable temporary ebbs and flows that may show\nup in high frequency economic data. The analysis I will share with you today, I hope, will\nreflect this perspective.\nI’d like to begin with an overview of the main points I will cover today.\nI’ll start on an optimistic note, recognizing that half of the adult population, or more, in\neach New England state has already received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, all six\nstates in the region are among the top ten U.S. states with the highest percent of their population\nwith at least one vaccine dose. As a result, New England residents and businesses can\ncontemplate a somewhat more normalized summer. Indeed, high frequency data on economic\nactivity indicate that air travel is picking up, as are visits to restaurants – suggesting that\nindustries hard hit by social distancing are now beginning to recover. And the New England\neconomy, like the national economy, is in the process of experiencing rapid growth in real output\nand notable improvements in payroll employment relative to the levels seen at the depths of the\npandemic.\nDespite the improved public health outlook and the expansion in economic activity, it is\nvery important to note that significant slack remains in the economy. U.S. unemployment in\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMarch was still elevated compared to pre-pandemic readings. And the unemployment rate does\nnot include the millions who have left the workforce since the pandemic began. The labor force\nparticipation rate, measured by the percent of the population in the workforce, whether employed\nor unemployed, remains depressed. Therefore, while rapid economic growth is very good news,\nit was, and still is, badly needed to offset the sizable shock that occurred with the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe strong outlook for the economy is not just reflecting the progress toward\nnormalization of the public health situation and the resulting reopening of businesses; it is also\nthe result of aggressive government policy actions. Fiscal policy has been unusually stimulative,\nand in some innovative ways, providing a major boost to the pandemic-shocked economy. The\nstance of monetary policy has also remained highly accommodative, as the Federal Reserve’s\nnew policy implementation framework places emphasis on realized, rather than expected,\noutcomes as part of material shifts in policy.1 This implies that current policy will remain\naccommodative until the labor market can consistently help deliver on the Fed’s 2 percent\ninflation goal, as is described in the most recent statement by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).2\nGiven the strong support from both fiscal and monetary policy, some analysts are worried\nthat inflation – dormant for most of the past decade, if not longer – could pick up significantly.\nAs I will discuss today, a number of temporary factors are likely to make measured inflation this\nspring higher than its underlying and more informative trend. These factors, to a large degree,\nare the result of the ebbs and flows of the pandemic, which has produced unusual patterns in the\nmonthly economic data.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIndeed, payroll employment, retail sales, and inflation numbers have all been influenced\nby pandemic-related events. As a case in point, at the outset of the pandemic the contraction in\npayroll employment and retail sales led to a notable decline in prices and a slowdown in the\nassociated 12-month measures of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index. However, as the weak March and April\ninflation readings of last year drop out of the 12-month computation, measured inflation will\nrebound, largely reflecting the reversal of deflationary pressures that occurred in late spring and\nearly summer of last year.\nOther factors are also likely to distort the inflation numbers this spring. Oil prices, which\ndeclined dramatically as travel fell, have increased significantly of late. Pent-up demand for\ngoods has resulted in the rise of shipping costs, and delays in unloading at ports have made it\ndifficult for many businesses to restock their shelves. All these factors will likely result in\ntemporary increases in prices.\nThe Federal Reserve is, and should be, focused on the underlying rate of inflation, and\nnot on temporary price fluctuations, such as the ones just mentioned. In this regard, inflation\nexpectations remain stable, compensation and wages have yet to expand at rates that would drive\naccelerating inflation, and the most likely outcome remains that inflation will normalize close to\n2 percent.\nMonthly economic data can grab attention and fuel concern, so this is an important time\nto recognize distortions in the higher frequency data brought by the pandemic. In short, it will be\nimportant to differentiate between temporary and longer-term trends. Of course, policymakers\nwill need to be vigilant in making sure that the post-pandemic economic environment does not\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbring structural changes that would lead to wages and prices being more responsive to tightening\nlabor market conditions.\n\nEbbs and Flows in the Economic Data\nFigure 1 provides a cell-phone-based mobility index that a data provider calculates based\non tracking foot traffic to different points of interest. At the beginning of the pandemic,\ngovernment-mandated shutdowns and concern with public health caused most of the public to\nstay in their residences, and as a result the mobility index fell precipitously. As government\nmandates lifted and people and firms adapted market transactions to social distancing needs,\nmobility increased. With progress in vaccinations since the height of the second wave in the\nwinter, many people are once again enjoying enhanced mobility. It is important to note that\nwhile mobility has clearly improved, it remains about 15 percent below 2019 levels.\nThis pattern can be seen even more clearly in the next slide. Figure 2 provides high\nfrequency spending data, again compared to the same period in 2019, but this time spending that\nrequires close personal contact is separate from spending that does not. Consumer spending\npatterns on goods and services less sensitive to social distancing already mirror 2019 spending\npatterns. However, spending that is more sensitive to social distancing – such as tourism and\ntravel – remains more than 20 percent below 2019 levels, even though it has improved\nsignificantly since the onset of widespread vaccinations.\nIt is my view that the ebbs and flows of spending sensitive to social distancing have\nimplications for future growth. The impact of the pandemic on such spending is worth noting.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt the outset of the pandemic social-distance-sensitive spending fell, rebounded quite rapidly\nwhen infections were low, fell again in the fall with a resurgence of cases, and has rebounded\nmore recently as vaccines have rolled out. While much progress has been made, one reason to\ncontinue to expect strong growth in employment and real GDP going forward is that there are a\nvariety of industries still impacted by the pandemic. Policymakers expect these effects to further\ndiminish as a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated and the infection rate diminishes\nfurther.\nThe same pattern can be seen in the more traditional retail sales data. Figure 3 provides\nthe monthly ebbs and flows in retail sales. Again, we see a similar pattern – a sharp decline at\nthe outset of the pandemic, a pick-up as COVID cases fell in the summer, a decline in the fall\nwith higher case counts, and a recent pick-up as more people are being vaccinated. In short, the\neconomic data, and in this case retail sales data, are strongly showing the impact of the\npandemic.\nAs previously mentioned, more than pandemic-driven business re-openings are driving\nconsumer spending. Many individuals fortunate enough to have not lost their job have increased\ntheir saving rate during the pandemic. This, in addition to the support from government\ntransfers, was largely because many households reduced their discretionary spending given the\npublic health concerns. As many individuals now have more opportunities to spend, that\nincreased savings represents pent-up demand for goods and services that were restricted during\nthe pandemic. The release of this pent-up demand should lead to strong growth going forward. In\nfact, consumption last quarter expanded more than 10 percent. This expectation of strong\nconsumption is one reason that at the March meeting of the FOMC, the median real GDP growth\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nforecast for 2021was 6.5 percent – a much faster pace of growth than what we normally\nexperience in the United States.\nWith an expected surge in spending, low interest rates, and stimulative fiscal policy,\nsome commentators have highlighted risks that inflation will pick up quickly. Figure 4 shows\nthe April forecasts of the Blue-Chip forecasters, roughly 50 private-sector economists. The left\npanel shows the distribution of their individual forecasts for inflation for 2021. The average of\nthe forecasts is 2.3 percent. In addition, the forecasters are tightly clustered between 2.1 and 2.5\npercent, with only a few isolated forecasters either above or below that range.\nThe right panel shows the distribution of Blue Chip forecasts for inflation for 2022. Here\nthe average is 2 percent, somewhat below this year’s average expectations. However, the 2022\nforecasts are now more dispersed, with most forecasts between 1.6 and 2.4 percent. Seventeen\nforecasters expect an inflation rate above 2 percent in 2022, while 21 forecasters expect a rate\nlower than 2 percent. And, the median for 2022 – 2 percent – is also the mode with 9 economists\nforecasting a rate of 2 percent in 2022. Overall, these private-sector forecasters expect slower\nprice increases in 2022 than 2021. This indicates that many prominent forecasters expect\nsomewhat more pronounced price increases in the near term, but that these increases will be\ntemporary and as such, will not significantly alter the underlying rate of inflation. Still, many of\nthem expect that once these temporary increases have dissipated, the inflation rate will remain\nnoticeably above 2 percent next year.\nI will now spend a few moments investigating with you why this uncertainty is a feature\nof the inflation outlook.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEbbs and Flows – Versus Trends – in Inflation\nFigure 5 shows the monthly changes in the CPI and PCE inflation indices.3 Like the\nspending data, inflation data show substantial effects from the pandemic. As the economy was\nclosing down in the early days of the pandemic, prices were being heavily discounted. As the\neconomy surged with reduced infections and a reduction in restrictions over last summer,\nmonthly prices rose quite rapidly. With a rise in infections as we approached winter, price\nincreases were again subdued; and now prices are again rising as people get vaccinated.\nThese price movements, intertwined with the ebb and flow of the pandemic, cause\nunusual patterns in the monthly inflation data. While the monthly data normally show only\nmodest fluctuations, the data for the past year are quite variable. This implies that annual\naverages of inflation will be impacted noticeably by these oscillations in the monthly readings.\nFor example, as the updated, rolling annual averages no longer include the initial months of the\npandemic, large negative observations will be dropped – which will cause the measured inflation\nover the past year to rise. Ideally, we should all focus on the more durable underlying price\nincreases and recognize that the choppiness of the data will cause some ebbs and flows in annual\naverages, largely tied to what was occurring with the pandemic last year.\nIn addition to the pandemic causing volatility in measured inflation, commodity prices\nlike oil are highly sensitive to current economic conditions. Figure 6 shows that oil prices have\nincreased substantially from a year ago. However, the magnitude of the increase reflects how\nweak oil prices were at the outset of the pandemic. Figure 7 illustrates that both oil prices and\nthe total PCE show significant movements depending on what was happening with the pandemic\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n(a sharp drop as the pandemic began, for example, and dips when cases flared up mid to late\n2020).\nSupply disruptions are also affecting prices in the short run. Many firms are currently\ncomplaining that they cannot get intermediate goods for production, or that it has become\nincreasingly costly and time consuming to replenish inventories. Ports have had difficulty\nunloading ships, resulting in back-ups. Figure 8 shows a measure of shipping costs, which\nindicates that as pandemic restraints have been lifted, the cost of shipping has risen markedly.\nFigure 9 highlights that import prices have exhibited significant movements related to\nthe pandemic. Foreign producers dropped prices as the pandemic began, but with surging\ndemand and many impediments to production arising in many developing countries, prices of\nimports have been rising.\nThe supply constraints occurring with surging demand are particularly problematic for\nsome firms, because of their reliance on just-in-time inventory processes. While keeping\ninventory levels low reduces carrying costs, it also means that many goods may be in short\nsupply in the near term. Figure 10 shows that inventories declined significantly at the outset of\nthe pandemic and still lag pre-pandemic levels quite significantly. As a result, in addition to a\nsurge in consumer demand, many firms are trying to rebuild their inventories.\nIn sum, as all these charts illustrate, we should expect that measured inflation will\naccelerate this spring. However, my view is that this acceleration in the rate of price increases is\nlikely to prove temporary. Toilet paper and Clorox were in short supply at the outset of the\npandemic, but manufacturers eventually increased supply, and those items are no longer scarce.\nMany of the factors raising prices this spring are also likely to be similarly short-lived.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, the debate about whether trend inflation will rise as the economy strongly recovers,\nrepresented by the dispersion of Blue Chip inflation forecasts for 2022, will not be answered\nuntil next year.\n\nPolicy Implications\nThe Federal Reserve should be and is focused on underlying inflationary trends. Onetime, temporary changes in prices should not impact the medium-term trajectory of inflation.\nWhen people expect persistently higher inflation, it would follow that wages would begin\nto reflect these higher expectations. Figure 11 shows that average hourly earnings are higher.\nHowever, it is important to appreciate a nuance: much of this trend reflects that, unfortunately,\nfirms impacted by social distancing reduced staff that were generally lower paid, and this made\nthe calculation of average hourly earnings rise. The employment cost index controls for\ncomposition changes in the workforce, and to date is not showing much change.\nFigure 12 summarizes the outlook for inflation from the Blue Chip forecasters. Despite\nthe ebbs and flows of the data, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 percent over the forecast\nhorizon. This does seem to me to be the most likely outcome, which should allow monetary\npolicymakers to be patient in removing accommodation, until more progress in the labor market\nhas occurred.\nHowever, the pandemic is likely to change some behaviors. Both spending patterns and\nwork environments are likely to be altered by the pandemic. It is too early to know whether the\neconomic relationships we observed pre-pandemic will behave similarly in the post-pandemic\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nera. It will be particularly important to see whether wages and prices continue to be relatively\nunresponsive to the tightening of the labor market.\n\nConcluding Observations\nWith a shock as large as the pandemic, policymakers need to be alert to potential changes\nto the economy. To date, inflation expectations and the underlying inflation rate look to be\nstable. It is important to keep in mind the difficulty that was experienced in achieving inflation\nof 2 percent in the United States and most of the developed world after the Great Financial\nCrisis.4 As a result, my perspective is that the emphasis on actual outcomes rather than forecasts\nof rising inflationary pressures when setting monetary policy appears justified. However, given\nthe noise in the data, it will be important to carefully filter underlying inflation trends as labor\nmarkets tighten.\nThank you for having me today, and I wish you all an enjoyable – and healthy – spring\nand summer.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion of the changes to the framework, see: Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\n2\n\nFor more discussion, see the April 28, 2021 statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC):\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210428a.htm.\nEconomists typically measure inflation as inflation over the year – the percent change in either the CPI or PCE for\na given month from the same month in the previous year (as is done in Figures 6 and 7).

U.S. Eastern Time on\nWednesday, May 12, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRemarks at the Panel Discussion,\n“Central Bank Perspectives on Central Bank\nDigital Currencies”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nHarvard Law School,\nProgram on International Financial Systems\nMay 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThank you for the opportunity to join you for this important discussion today. The topic\nof central bank digital currencies is certainly of interest to the Federal Reserve and other nations’\ncentral banks around the world. Like others, the Federal Reserve System is considering both the\ntechnical and policy issues surrounding all aspects of a central bank digital currency. In my brief\nremarks today on the panel, I will touch on several of these key considerations.\nThanks in part to the lower cost of information and data processing, brought on by\ntechnology advances, payments and payment systems are changing rapidly. In the United States,\nthere has been a growing need to update our payments system to allow for cutting-edge digitized\ncommerce. A major step in that direction came in the form of the 2019 announcement of the\nlargest payments system investment by the Federal Reserve in 40 years – specifically our plans\nto roll out an instant payment system, FedNow, running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and\navailable to banks of any size in the United States.1\nFedNow is intended to be a fast, seamless, and secure way to transmit funds. The Federal\nReserve System is expecting to launch the service in 2023, and I would note that FedNow will\nprovide many of the use cases frequently associated with potential digital currencies, including\nfacilitating digital commerce in dollars. It may, over time, also have the capacity to significantly\nreduce costs for a variety of transactions, including possibly international transactions. In\naddition, a faster payments system – combined with a no-cost transaction account at banks –\ncould potentially promote better economic inclusion in the financial system for many citizens.\nIn addition to the work being done on FedNow, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is\nalso engaged in research focused on the technology related to a central bank digital currency. At\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe outset, it is important to highlight that this is exploratory work, and any decision to move\nforward with such a currency would depend on a variety of factors beyond the technological\nfeasibility and implementation.2 Of course a variety of very difficult policy issues would need to\nbe resolved to appropriately design key features of a central bank digital currency.\nA variety of reasons are sometimes offered for deploying a central bank digital currency,\nincluding:\n•\n\nresolving issues with financial inclusion, such as serving the unbanked;\n\n•\n\nreducing costly cross-border transactions;\n\n•\n\nproviding monetary policy with additional flexibility;\n\n•\n\nfacilitating targeted fiscal transfers; and\n\n•\n\nreducing counterparty risk by using legal tender.\n\nDesign choices would involve trade-offs, however, including introducing additional\ncomplexity that could actually slow the processing of large volumes of transactions. In addition,\none must be attuned to the possibility of unintended consequences, including the possibility of\nrapid movements of funds which could impact financial stability.\nIn part, of course, it is important to understand what problems a central bank digital\ncurrency is being designed to solve, and whether other technologies could more cheaply or\nefficiently address those problems. Nonetheless, work on understanding the technical hurdles to\na central bank digital currency can proceed, while these very difficult policy issues are\nconsidered and navigated.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI am not going to discuss in any detail today the policy issues involved, but I will touch\non the work being done by Boston Federal Reserve Bank that is focused on the technology. This\nwork has two major components.\nThe first component is a joint exploration with MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI)\ninto the use of existing and new technologies to build and test a hypothetical digital currency\nplatform.3 Dubbed “Project Hamilton,” the effort is designed to determine the feasibility of the\ncore processing of a central bank digital currency, while leaving substantial flexibility for the\nimpact of future policy decisions.\nA central bank digital currency would need to be able to provide rapid processing of a\nlarge number of transactions in geographically dispersed locations. We anticipate that in early\nthird quarter of this year, MIT and the Boston Fed will release a white paper that will document\nthe ability to meet reasonable goals with core processing, and create an open source license for\nthe code. Additional work following the white paper’s release will explore how addressing\nadditional requirements including resiliency, privacy, and anti-money laundering features will\nimpact the core processing.\nA second component, and area of exploration, will focus on comparing Project Hamilton\nwith some of the private-sector platforms currently being built, and open-source platforms for a\npossible digital currency. This workstream will examine how each platform performs in similar\nenvironments, with a focus on being able to provide a large number of transactions across\ndifferent locations in a short period of time.\nIt is important to note that there are many complementary aspects of the Federal\nReserve’s work on FedNow, and the exploration of a central bank digital currency. Both require\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntechnology experts to study and pursue topics ranging from data architecture, to coding, to\neffective use of the cloud. It may be, even, that some significant aspects of both systems could\nbe run on the same payments backbone. Certainly there is much to explore, and the eventual\npayments platform choices are quite uncertain, but this is an exciting area for central banks to\ncontinue to explore.\nThank you for having me join you today.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Aug. 8, 2019 Federal Register Notice: Federal Register :: Federal Reserve Actions To\nSupport Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments, and subsequent announcement on Aug. 15, 2019: Federal Reserve\nNames Ken Montgomery Leader of Newly Announced FedNow Service for Real-Time Gross Settlement of Faster\nPayments - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org).\nFor more context, see Feb. 5, 2020 remarks by Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Lael Brainard: Speech by\nGovernor Brainard on the digitalization of payments and currency (federalreserve.gov)\n2\n\n3\n\nFor more, see: The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston announces collaboration with MIT to research digital currency\n- Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n\n4\n\n\f",

        "content": "Public Service That Makes a Difference®\n\nA Fireside Chat on Current Economic\nConditions\nBy Eric S. Rosengren\n\nWednesday, June 23, 2021\n\nVirtual\n\nNational Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter\n\nFigures (pdf)\n\n5 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric\nRosengren’s June 23, 2021, remarks\n1. Takeaway: Vaccination rates have been better than expected in\nmuch of the U.S., and that’s led to a more rapid reopening of\nthe economy than was forecast earlier this year.\nExcerpt: “I think the most important message is that we really have\na quite a robust recovery that is underway. The economy is opening\nup faster than we would have anticipated five or six months ago.\nOur latest information\nVaccination rates particularly in New England but throughout the\non COVID-19\ncountry have occurred more rapidly than we anticipated. And as a\nPrivacy - Terms\n\n\fresult, businesses are reopening much more quickly.”\n2. Takeaway: Forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP) have\nbeen significantly upgraded since the start of this year, with\nthe median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee\nmembers at 7% growth for 2021. That is unusually high for a\nU.S. recovery.\nExcerpt: “Seven percent is … more like a number that you would\nexpect from an emerging market, not a developed country like the\nUnited States, and really highlights how strong the economic growth\nis expected to be over the course of this year.”\n3. Takeaway: Despite the positive signs, we still have quite a way\nto go before we reach full employment, given the most recent\nunemployment rate was 5.8%, substantially above the 4.5%\nFOMC participants project by the end of 2021. One reason for\nthat is a slower recovery in public-facing services, including\ntourism, hospitality, restaurants, and retail.\nExcerpt: “If you're working in a store, if you’re working a hotel,\nyou're probably having a lot of contact with people, some of whom\nwill be vaccinated, some of them will not, and you may just not be\nwilling to take that much of a risk for a job that's not paying much\nmore than minimum wage.”\n4. Takeaway: Inflation is higher, but spikes in food and energy\nprices explain much of this, and those will moderate. Increased\ninflation can also be attributed to a variety of things that have\nhappened over the last six months because of the unusual\nfacets of coming out of a pandemic – including shortages in a\nvariety of goods and services that we don’t normally\nexperience during a recovery.\nExcerpt: “Most Fed speakers have talked about expecting inflation\nto come back to 2%. That is my forecast as well, that I expect us to\nbe slightly above 2%. … So, I think the Fed’s expectation, that most\nof the price movement that's occurring this year is not sustained into\n\n\fnext year, is actually a pretty common forecast.”\n5. Takeaway: Low rates and a high degree of stimulus have been\nappropriate, but it is important over time to watch for\nconditions that potentially raise financial stability issues.\nExcerpt: “Housing prices [are] something worth closely monitoring. If\nwe continue to see housing appreciation like we've been seeing, I\nthink over time we'd have to take a hard look to see whether we're\ngetting some spillovers from some of the monetary policy\naccommodation that we're having and think about ways to mitigate\nthat.”\n\nStraight to your inbox: News and\ninsight from the Boston Fed.\nSign up to receive the latest speeches from Boston Fed experts, along with\nour press releases and newsletter.\n\nEmail\nSubscribe\nSee our privacy policy\n\ncollapse all\n\nAbout the Authors\nEric S.

Takeaway: Rosengren observed that short-term credit markets\nhave been disrupted in the past two recessions, and significant\nrisks remain. For example, prime money market mutual funds\nand stablecoins bear attention.\nExcerpt on money market funds: “The result has been that [prime]\nmoney market funds have been a critical feature of the financial\ncrises that we've seen in the last decade, and this is a problem that\nhas yet to be resolved.”\nExcerpt on stablecoins: “I think there's a financial stability concern\nthat a future crisis could easily be triggered as these become a\nmore important sector of the financial market, unless we start\nregulating them and making sure that there's actually a lot more […]\nstability to what is being marketed to the general public as a ‘stable’\ncoin.”\n2. Takeaway: Substantial emergency actions were necessary to\nsupport lending during the pandemic, and the economy would\nbenefit from being less dependent on ad hoc measures in\ncrises.\n\n\fExcerpt: “We need a less ad hoc approach to these crises. We need\nto think more systematically about how we can make sure that\ncredit is available, and not only to the largest institutions, but many\nof the small- and medium-sized enterprises as well.”\n3.\n\nTakeaway: A properly implemented Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer, or CCyB, would help avoid some of these issues.\nExcerpt: “I think a well-designed CCyB, which is a counter cyclical\ncapital charge, which builds up capital buffers during good times\n[and] gets released when we have bad economic times, would have\nmade … at least some of those measures less necessary, because\nit would have been a natural way to provide a lot more capacity for\nbanks to continue to do their lending.”\n\n4.\n\nTakeaway: Unfortunately, emergency facilities do well\nsupporting large firms but are challenged somewhat to reach\nsmall firms. Without better facilities for small firms, the\nsituation will increase economic concentration.\nExcerpt: “So, if we continue to have these kind of crises where\nthese kind of interventions are needed, I think ultimately it's going to\nresult in a greater concentration that we want in the U.S. economy,\nin the corporate sector.”\n\n5.\n\nTakeaway: Housing prices have played a role in financial\nstability problems in the past, so recent housing price trends\nshould be monitored closely by policymakers.\nExcerpt: “Around the world, banking crises and financial stability\nperiods are frequently tied to real estate... And, so, I think this bears\nwatching as a potential ‘side effect’ that [policymakers] have to be\nthinking about as we [determine] what appropriate monetary policy\nis, going forward.”\n\nStraight to your inbox: News and\n\n\finsight from the Boston Fed.\nSign up to receive the latest speeches from Boston Fed experts, along with\nour press releases and newsletter.\n\nEmail\nSubscribe\nSee our privacy policy\n\ncollapse all\n\nexpand all\n\nAbout the Authors\nEric S.

Montgomery\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWelcoming Remarks at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n64th Economic Conference, entitled\n“Racial Disparities in Today’s Economy”\nOctober 4, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the first of two economic conferences to\nbe hosted by the Boston Fed this fall. We had hoped by now we would be able to hold this event\nin person; but public health trends had other plans, and made it advisable to hold the events\nremotely. But, we are grateful to all our participants, speakers, and audience members for\njoining us to discuss, dissect, and analyze a vital topic – racial disparities in today’s economy.\nI appreciate the Bank’s research leaders for putting together another rigorous, analytical,\nhighly relevant economic conference, the 64th held by the Bank over many years, exploring\nimportant economic issues. And I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words as we open the\nconference.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in studying gaps in credit,\nemployment, and wealth – across race, ethnicity, and gender – with an eye to policies and actions\nthat can make a difference. More than three decades ago, the Bank’s research department\ncontributed groundbreaking work on racial differences in home mortgage lending. That initial\nresearch led to a large body of rigorous academic work that was subsequently published in\nleading economic journals, and also led to important policy actions.\nMore recently, we at the Boston Fed have done studies focused on racial and ethnic\ndifferences in wealth. And we are proud to be one of three Federal Reserve Banks that initiated\nthe Racism and the Economy event series that now has the participation and sponsorship of all\ntwelve regional Reserve Banks, and has seen the participation of tens of thousands of interested\nindividuals across the country.1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI mention these efforts in order to emphasize the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\ncontinued commitment to this vital exploration. While this work and interest is not new to the\nBoston Fed, it is important to hold a rigorous and analytical economic conference focused on\nracial disparities in the economy, at this time. As we have learned from the discussions in the\nFederal Reserve System’s Racism and the Economy series in recent months, the lamentable fact\nis that differences in racial, ethnic, and gender outcomes remain large in the economic data –\nparticularly in the areas of employment, credit, wealth, education, and health. Even more\nsobering, for us as a society, is the fact that these persistent differences in the data have not\nlessened since the Boston Fed’s research first described disparities in mortgage lending practices\n30 years ago.\nConsider these striking statistics: over the past 35 years, the Black unemployment rate\nhas exceeded 10 percent for 60 percent of the time, spending roughly 21 years at over 10 percent.\nAt the same time, the white unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent for just 3 months, in 2020,\nat the outset of the pandemic. The persistence of these gaps also underscores why it is so\nimportant for the Federal Reserve to conduct research on economic racial disparities if we are to\nachieve the full employment component of our “dual mandate” from Congress.2 I’ll say it again:\nunderstanding racial disparities is essential to the Federal Reserve’s full employment mandate.\nOver the next few days, we will have many terrific presenters – as Jeff mentioned –\nsharing their research on racial disparities in labor market outcomes, in education, in housing, in\nwealth, and in criminal justice.\nWe will begin, however, with a keynote presentation, further setting the stage for much\nof the discussion that will follow.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAnd it is my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker, Dean Kerwin K. Charles, of the\nYale School of Management. Dean Charles’ research focuses on earnings and wealth inequality,\nconspicuous consumption, race and gender discrimination in labor markets, the intergenerational\ntransmission of economic status, worker and family adjustment to job loss and health shocks, and\nthe labor market consequences of housing bubbles and sectoral change.

Montgomery\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWelcoming Remarks and Conference Overview\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n65th Economic Conference, entitled\n“The Implications of High Leverage for Financial Instability\nRisk, Real Economic Activity, and Appropriate Policy\nResponses”\nNovember 8, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the Boston Fed’s 65th annual economic\nconference – the second of two economic conferences hosted by the Bank this fall. We are\npleased to have our speakers, participants, and audience members join us this week to discuss\nand analyze a very important topic – the implications of high leverage. As noted in the title of\nthe conference, we want to explore the implications of high leverage for financial instability risk,\nfor real economic activity, and for policy responses.\nI am grateful to my colleagues in the Boston Fed’s Research Department for putting\ntogether another in a long line of rigorous and relevant economic conferences. Our intention\nwith these conferences has always been to convene experts who can explore important economic\nissues and contribute to improving policy and outcomes. So I appreciate the opportunity to say a\nfew words of introduction and overview as we open the 65th such gathering.\nI’ll begin by saying the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in\nstudying financial instability risks, specifically the implications of these risks for the real\neconomy. Eric Rosengren, who recently retired as president of the Bank, studied and spoke\nabout these issues, first as a researcher and later as a policymaker, often working alongside Joe\nPeek and his colleagues. All told, the Bank has, for some time, emphasized the important role of\ncredit in the economy and the importance of financial stability considerations in monetary policy\ndeliberations.\nThis focus at the Boston Fed has allowed us to contribute in significant ways to policy\ndiscussions and decisions at some critical moments for the U.S. economy. Two such examples,\nabout which I will touch on only very briefly, are the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19\npandemic. Indeed, in both cases, we had the opportunity to play key roles in implementing and\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nadministering Federal Reserve System programs intended to help provide liquidity to markets\nand support credit availability to the private sector.\nThe first example I’ll point to – the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, which was\ntriggered and exacerbated by a financial crisis – drove home the critical importance of having a\nstable and resilient financial system. Policymakers have since taken many actions to strengthen\nregulation of financial institutions in order to minimize the risk of a repeat financial crisis and\nresulting disastrous collapse in economic activity of the sort we experienced during the Great\nRecession. Take, for instance, the introduction of stress testing for large banks and a number of\nother regulatory measures that led to a relatively well-capitalized banking system.\nIn contrast, over the past decade, we have seen other sectors’ indebtedness climbing – to\npotentially concerning levels. In particular, by some measures, nonfinancial business leverage is\nhistorically high – perhaps due, in part, to extremely low interest rates globally. Our conference\naims to analyze the risks of such high leverage for the broader economy – and also provide a\nforum for discussion of appropriate policy responses targeted at mitigating those risks.\nI’ll turn now to the second example – focused on the Fed’s response to the economic\nemergency brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S.,\nstarting in March 2020, had a devastating impact on many households and businesses, especially\nsmall businesses. Many business owners lost revenue streams overnight, as they had to\nsubstantially curtail or even shut down operations. Millions of workers lost their jobs. The\nabrupt and drastic disruptions, along with extremely elevated uncertainty, caused widespread\nturmoil in financial markets.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConfronted with such unprecedented disruptions to the U.S. economy, public\npolicymakers – both monetary and fiscal – took decisive actions to support households,\nbusinesses, and markets in order to stabilize the financial sector and ultimately help minimize\ndamage to the real economy. The Federal Reserve, with support from the Treasury Department,\nintroduced a number of liquidity and credit facilities to ensure businesses, as well as consumers,\ncould readily access the credit they needed in order to weather the pandemic-induced\ninterruptions. The Main Street Lending Program, 1 one such facility that was administered by the\nBoston Fed on behalf of the Federal Reserve System, supported continued operations of small\nand medium sized businesses, despite the pandemic disruptions.\nThe Bank’s 65 th annual research conference is intended to contribute to our\nunderstanding of how leverage affects financial stability risks, and ultimately the resilience of\nthe real economy – in particular the effect of leverage on key macroeconomic variables such as\nemployment and investment. In addition to a focus on the business sector, the conference will\nalso include analysis of the effects of household leverage on the severity of the Great Recession,\nas well as analysis of how the commercial real estate sector can best recover after the pandemic.\nAnother particularly timely topic to be considered is the likely difficult trade-off for\npolicymakers going forward – stemming from the unfortunate side effects of some of the policy\nmeasures taken to combat the pandemic, given that they added more debt to businesses’ already\ndebt-laden balance sheets.\nI am confident the insights we take from the discussions and presentations during the next\nthree days can contribute to improving the formulation of public policy going forward. Again, I\nwant to thank our organizers, presenters, discussants, and audience members for taking part.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt this point, it is my pleasure to introduce the moderator of the first day of the\nconference, Benjamin Friedman. Professor Friedman is the William Joseph Maier Professor of\nPolitical Economy at Harvard University.\nProfessor Friedman’s work has focused on monetary policy – including the optimal\nconduct of policy and the transmission of policy through the financial system to the real\neconomy – as well as the role of central banks in maintaining financial stability and formulating\nappropriate policy responses to various crises.\nMore recently, Professor Friedman has broadened even further his distinguished portfolio\nof work, with his newest book, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, which provides a\nfundamental reassessment of the foundations of current-day economics and shows how religious\nthinking has shaped economic thinking.\nPlease join me in welcoming Professor Friedman – truly an expert on many of the topics\nthat will be central to this conference.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nFor more information, see: Main Street Lending Program - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n\n4\n\n\f",
