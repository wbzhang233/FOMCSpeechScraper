Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConnecticut Business and Industry Association’s\n2008 Economic Summit and Outlook\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 8, 2008\n\nI would like to thank the CBIA for organizing this event and for scheduling it after New\nYear’s Day, since economists tend not to be particularly helpful for holiday cheer but quite\nuseful when thinking of New Year’s resolutions. On your list of New Year’s resolutions, I\nwould include not listening to pundits who claimed:\n\n1) …that housing prices could not go down, nationally;\n2) …that triple-A ratings meant no default risk;\n3) …that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products.\n\nMy talk today will touch on all three, because I am going to discuss recent trends in residential\nreal estate, and their economic relevance. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday I am going to examine two prior periods of declining house prices – with some\nobservations on how they were addressed, the similarities and differences from our situation\ntoday, and the lessons we can draw. Throughout, I will refer to actions being pursued by a wide\nvariety of actors including the Federal Reserve, financial institutions, investors, borrowers, and\npolicymakers.\n\nRecent Trends in Residential Investment\nIn 2007, residential investment was the laggard among the components of Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). Residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006,\nand has continued to decline in each quarter since. It seems all but certain that residential\ninvestment also declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 – and many economic forecasts expect\nresidential investment to continue to decline at least through the first half of 2008.\nHow should we interpret what could be nine or more continuous quarters of declining\nresidential investment? Exhibit 1 provides some initial context. Should the forecasts prove to be\nright, we will have experienced a longer string of back-to-back quarters of declining residential\ninvestment than at any other time in the past 50 years. 2, 3\nThat historical observation should focus our attention, but must also be tempered\nsomewhat by the unique aspects of our current situation. Let me be clear – this is an unusual\neconomic situation and we cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. For one thing, to date\nthis decline in residential investment has occurred in an economic environment of reasonably\nhealthy job and income growth, and low rates of unemployment – although the December Labor\nDepartment report, released last Friday, suggests less welcome developments, as the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nunemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December while non-farm payroll employment was\nessentially unchanged (an increase nationwide of 18,000). 4\nPrevious periods where residential investment declined for a year or more were either\naccompanied by, or closely followed by, an economic downturn. But history may or may not\nrepeat itself, because this period of prolonged weakness in housing is distinctive in several other\nways that add to uncertainty over its ultimate impact on the broader economy.\nFor one thing, most other periods of extended decline in residential investment were\npreceded by rising inflation rates, which in turn induced a policy response – usually in the form\nof a significant tightening of monetary policy (that is, increases in interest rates) [see Exhibit 2].\nHowever, the current period of weakness in housing has occurred despite a low inflation rate and\nlow real interest rates, by historical standards.\nAnother difference has been the national nature of the decline in housing prices.\nHistorically, housing prices have often shown sharp swings in particular states or regions, but it\nwas unusual for prices to fall nationwide.\nThrough the 1980s there were a series of rolling regional downturns that resulted in big\nfluctuations in regional housing prices. These were generally due to significant regional\neconomic factors, such as the surge in oil prices in the late 1970s that disproportionately boosted\nthe southwestern portion of the country. When oil prices then fell by nearly half in the early\n1980s, this same region experienced sharp drops in home prices. Similarly, the northeast’s\nhouse-price cycle of the 1980s and early 1990s was a regional phenomenon, as the promise of a\nnew technology-based “economic miracle” proved too good to be true.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn these earlier episodes, housing finance was still dominated by local financial\ninstitutions; and house price declines were regional, not national, and were not particularly well\nsynchronized with national recessions.\nThe regional nature of these housing problems is illustrated in Exhibit 3, which plots\nchanges in real estate prices by census region. Movements of housing prices in various regions\nduring the 1980s – shown on the far left side of the chart – were not particularly correlated.\nHousing prices in some regions went up despite significant declines in other regions. The\nOFHEO national house price index did not decline, giving some analysts a false sense of\nconfidence that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate loans would perform at least\nreasonably well, since real estate prices were dominated by local effects.\nThen, over the 1990s, there was less regional variation in housing price appreciation and\nmore of a common trend, which has become more pronounced recently. Greater correlation of\nhousing price increases and decreases across regions of the country meant that the diversification\nbenefit resulting from holding a national portfolio of real estate loans was significantly less than\nhistory would imply.\nWith housing price changes more correlated across regions, mortgage securities and\nderivatives of mortgage securities behaved differently than many investors had assumed they\nwould. The Boston Fed’s research 5 shows that, in large part due to widespread house-price\ndeclines, foreclosures have risen sharply in much of the country – not just in regional pockets.\nMany of the investment products consisting of securitized mortgages assumed more favorable\nhouse-price trends, so many that carried triple-A ratings have been downgraded to below\ninvestment grade – or are trading as if they were downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn part, the trend towards securitizing mortgage loans allowed the financing arrangements\nto be driven by national rather than regional conditions. As long as investor demand for higheryielding mortgage securities and derivatives was strong, there was little of the natural “governor”\nthat occurs when financial institutions become unduly concentrated in particular regions or asset\nclasses. This change enabled the supply of financing, particularly to riskier borrowers, to expand\nrapidly in all regions of the country.\nExhibit 4 illustrates how abruptly the pattern in house prices has changed. The home\nprice indexes generated by both the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight\n(OFHEO) 6 and S&P/Case-Shiller 7 show that home prices that accelerated during the first half of\nthe decade have been quickly reversing that trend.\nAs of the close of the third quarter, the S&P/Case-Shiller index indicates that house\nprices are down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite 10 monthly\nindex, representing the average of 10 large metropolitan areas, provides more recent data and has\ndeclined by 6.7 percent over the last year. 8 This is the largest decline in the 21-year history of\nthe index.\nThere has also been significant variation across metropolitan areas, illustrated in Exhibit\n5. The largest decline among the 10 metro areas was in Miami, where prices have declined by\n12.4 percent over the past year, while Denver’s decline was just 1.8 percent.\nWhile real estate has not generally experienced the volatility of many financial\ninstruments, large regional price declines over a relatively short period of time can, and have,\noccurred. And if regional price declines are becoming more tightly correlated, as some of this\nsuggests, a more significant national house price decline cannot be ruled out.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe sharp declines experienced in many regions of the country have occurred despite low\nreal interest rates and, until December, an unemployment rate below 5 percent. This highlights a\nrisk to the housing sector going forward: Since prices have declined substantially even in a\nrelatively benign economic environment, one cannot discount the possibility that they could fall\nmore rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008.\n\nThe Real Effects of Housing Price Declines\nWhile the outlook for housing will be greatly affected by the economy, history indicates\nthat “institutional” factors can also play an important role. It is instructive to compare our\ncurrent situation with earlier episodes of falling housing prices. Two very different scenarios,\nand outcomes, are illustrated by experiences in New England and Japan.\nTo give you a peek at the punch line, let me mention up front what I think the broadest\nlessons are:\n First, that transparency matters, and is generally beneficial;\n Second, that prompt recognition of losses leads to a more efficient outcome – if\nsomewhat more pain in the short run;\n Third, that adjustments are easier in an orderly economic environment with a wellfunctioning financial system. This is something the Federal Reserve is working to\nhelp ensure.\n\nNew England’s Experience\nExhibit 6 illustrates the significant decline in house prices that occurred in New England\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast to the current period, many of those loans were\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nheld by local financial institutions. As prospects for the New England economy boomed in the\nmid to late 1980s, these financial institutions significantly increased their portfolio of\nconstruction, residential, and commercial real estate loans.\nFinancial institutions were regionally based, so they were highly susceptible to regional\nshocks. When the New England economy subsequently faltered, the real estate market\ncollapsed. Prices on both residential and commercial real estate declined, resulting in losses to\nbanks’ loan portfolios. Many financial institutions found that they were inadequately diversified\nand had inadequate capital to absorb losses.\nThe supervisory process forced banks to recognize these losses. A key component of the\nbank examiner’s job is to insure that problem loans are appropriately recognized on bank balance\nsheets. Accordingly, banks were forced to write down the value of real estate loans to reflect\ndeclines in the value of the underlying collateral, and the reduced ability of borrowers to service\ntheir loans. In fact, very large declines in bank assets frequently occurred at the time of bank\nexaminations. 9\nThe large losses sustained by banks in that era resulted in 115 banks failing. 10 The\ncombination of failed banks and significant losses at surviving banks limited the supply of credit\nto bank-dependent borrowers, many of whom were engaged in businesses not directly related to\nreal estate. Many of the problem loans ended up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), which expedited the necessary adjustment process by quickly disposing of\nthe collateral property.\nThe prompt action of the bank examiners and the FDIC was, and remains, controversial.\nThe swiftness of the write-downs and disposal of troubled assets initially aggravated the decline\nin residential and commercial prices. But it also meant that prices fell to the point that many\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninvestors became convinced that subsequent capital gains were inevitable. Thus, while the\ndecline in prices was steep, the duration of the problem was probably shortened by aggressive\nand transparent actions. Within four years of the trough, housing prices had already returned to\ntheir previous peak.\n\nJapan’s Experience\nOne can think of the New England experience, and the swift action of examiners, as one\nend of a continuum. At the other end is the experience in Japan. As the 1990s began, stock\nprices and real estate prices peaked. While stock prices fell relatively quickly, real estate prices\ndeclined much more gradually.\nKeenly aware of the credit-crunch experienced in the United States, Japanese regulators\nchose to move slowly in forcing write-downs of problem assets. In fact, in the early 1990s there\nwas relatively little official information published on the extent of problems. To prevent writedowns, problem assets were not revealed publicly. This lack of transparency and disclosure\nmade many investors and counterparties wary of Japanese financial institutions, as the magnitude\nof problems was difficult to discern. In addition, financial institutions and the government\naccumulated problem assets, which they held rather than disposing of the assets at “distress”\nprices.\nWhile reported prices in real estate declined slowly, volume was limited by investors’\nconcerns that the large pool of problem assets would eventually need to be sold in the market.\nWhile bank lending did not decline abruptly, several studies have indicated that lending was\nquite inefficient – often used to prop up distressed borrowers rather than to allocate credit in the\neconomy more efficiently. 11\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe overall result was that real estate prices declined for over a decade [see Exhibit 7].\nMirroring the gradual decline in prices, the recovery in prices was similarly very slow. The\neconomy experienced subpar growth for an extended period of time.\nWhile our current period is different in many ways from the New England and Japan\nexperiences with declining real estate prices, there are lessons to be drawn.\nFor one, the degree of transparency in financial statements can significantly affect\nconfidence in financial institutions. Uncertainty about asset values may ultimately be worse than\nlosses.\nIn the past cases of New England and Japan, and today as well, there are concerns about\nthe value of the underlying assets complicating matters. In New England the problem\nmanifested itself because real estate, especially commercial real estate, changes hands relatively\ninfrequently – particularly in a slump – and thus is difficult to value. The slow recovery of\nJapanese financial institutions was in part related to significant concerns about their true\nfinancial condition, as many of the assets held by banks in Japan were loans to finance assets\nwhich changed hands relatively infrequently. The complex, opaque nature of many of today's\nmortgage-derivative instruments also makes them very difficult to value, which in turn makes\nthem relatively illiquid.\nHistory suggests it is at such times that enhanced transparency can help clarify the extent\nof the problems, and allow financial market participants to determine appropriate valuations for\nassets and whether valuation methods are being conservatively applied. I am hopeful that the\nmanagement of firms with large exposures to securitized subprime mortgages will embrace more\ndetailed disclosures that allow for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the problems.\nFinancial institutions with poor transparency are likely to have greater difficulty raising external\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nfunds at favorable prices; and indeed, we have seen significant tiering along these lines in the\nfederal funds market and other credit markets.\nLooking at the New England and Japan experiences, let me be clear that I am not\nadvocating responses to today’s problems that are at either extreme of the continuum. But\ncertainly we can learn what not to do from Japan’s experience. Clearly it is better to take care of\nproblems now than distort and greatly prolong the needed adjustment process.\nAlong with greater transparency, the New England experience reminds us that a full\nrecognition of losses will create incentives for firms to dispose of bad assets. However, we face\nan added challenge today. When problem loans were held in commercial banks, much of the\nloss recognition was enforced through the bank-examination process. With today’s opaque\nfinancial products held in a variety of financial intermediaries – not just traditional commercial\nbanks, and located both in the U.S. and abroad – the loss recognition is not likely to be\nconsistently enforced.\nMaintaining confidence in financial institutions and financial markets is key to a quick\nrecovery from a crisis. Falling real estate prices caused a credit crunch during the early 1990s\nNew England downturn, as banks reduced lending to borrowers in general as a result of the\nbanks’ capital-adequacy problems. In Japan, problem real estate loans caused banks to\nmisallocate credit to inefficient projects to prevent recognition of their problems. However, in\ntoday’s situation we are fortunate that most financial institutions have entered the current\nproblems with significant capital cushions and that many U.S. financial institutions are moving\nto proactively address the problems.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nHowever, the potential for a credit crunch remains. Commercial banks are still an\nimportant source of liquidity and there are troubling developments at work. Allow me to delve\nfor a moment into banking finance to make this point.\nMany commercial banks participated in the subprime market by sponsoring off-balance\nsheet investment vehicles. These vehicles were financed by short term commercial paper. In\nmany cases, subprime loans were only a small fraction of the asset holdings of these vehicles.\nHowever, investors are very leery of anything associated with subprime loans and are reluctant\nto buy the commercial paper of these vehicles.\nFor both reputational and legal reasons, some of the sponsoring banks are now moving\nthese off-balance sheet instruments onto their balance sheets, funding them as part of the bank\nportfolio. As shown in Exhibit 8, bank assets have grown significantly since the financial\nturmoil emerged in July. However, banks have capital requirements that limit their ability to\nexpand. Thus, there is a risk that this unintended growth in bank assets will squeeze out loans to\nother borrowers.\n\nRisk Mitigation by the Federal Reserve\nIn the midst of this recent financial turmoil, I am hopeful that actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve will reduce the potential negative impact.\nMy view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of\na more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling housing prices further weaken the\nincentives for residential investment, but are also likely to dampen consumer and business\nconfidence and spending. Furthermore, falling house prices roil financial markets and financial\ninstitutions by exacerbating exposures to the housing market.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the Federal Reserve can minimize the severity and\nspillover of housing and associated weakness by implementing policies that foster a sound\nmacroeconomic environment, low and stable inflation rates and a well-functioning financial\nsystems. In that regard, the Fed has reduced its key policy rate by 100 basis points over the past\nfive months.\nAlso, in an effort to help return markets to more normal short-term funding patterns, the\nFederal Reserve has initiated a new Term Auction Facility or TAF. The TAF enables banks with\nilliquid collateral to borrow from the discount window at a price determined by an open auction.\nThis innovative tool has the potential to provide greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to\nrespond to the sort of liquidity problems that we have seen in recent months. The benefit to\nbanks is that they can borrow relatively low-cost funds using assets that are temporarily illiquid\nas collateral. This facility is particularly useful in providing term lending, and appears to have\nbeen helpful as financial institutions sought liquidity at the end of 2007.\nThe first two auctions have provided term funding at a rate above the overnight federal\nfunds rate but below the primary credit rate that banks borrow from the Fed’s Discount Window.\nAn added benefit of the TAF is that it allows the Fed to supply funds to the market without\nadding to stresses in Treasury markets by engaging in direct purchases of Treasury securities.\nTreasury markets have experienced significant stress in recent months, as Treasury issues were\nin great demand by investors around the world who sought safe, liquid assets. 12\n\nOn a more regional note, the New England states have seen a falloff in housing\nconstruction and home sales roughly comparable to that of the nation. Housing prices, which\ngrew very rapidly from 1998 to 2005, have leveled off and in three New England states –\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire – prices are down from a year ago. 13 While\nConnecticut's experience is a little more favorable than some of its neighbors, the picture is\nbroadly similar.\nAs housing prices have leveled off or declined in New England, foreclosure rates have\nrisen from well below the national average to the national average, which is also rising. Again,\nConnecticut's experience is a little more favorable, but similar.\nThe increase in foreclosures has been particularly sharp for subprime adjustable rate\nmortgages. The typical subprime adjustable rate mortgage is a hybrid, with a fixed rate of about\n8 percent for two years that resets to about 11 percent. The surge in foreclosures thus far is not\ndue to resets. However, many borrowers holding subprime loans face resets in the coming year,\nindeed the next few quarters. This prospect threatens to make a difficult situation even worse.\nSo I am very pleased that five large New England banks have formed a consortium to\nreach out to subprime borrowers to see whether they might be candidates for loans at prime rates,\nmaking use of existing federal and state insurance programs. This initiative, called the Mortgage\nRelief Fund, was launched shortly before Christmas with a $125 million commitment from the\nfive banks and has already has some success in generating inquiries. Exhibit 9 is an excerpt from\nthe effort's web site.\nTo date the banks – Bank of America, Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth,\nand Webster Bank – have had over 430 calls from borrowers, and a number of them are\nbeginning the application process or have already submitted loan applications. Because\nborrowers can qualify for government-insured loan programs with as little as 3 percent equity in\nthe house, this is an important initiative for borrowers to consider if they are currently holding\nsubprime loans.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe challenge, really, is getting the word out and convincing borrowers who may face\ntrouble in coming months that it is in their best interest to act now.\nSo I strongly encourage homeowners paying a high subprime rate, and possibly facing a\nrate-reset to an even higher level, to visit the website – www.MortgageReliefFund.com – to\nbegin exploring whether they would be better off financially by taking advantage of this\nprogram.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is pleased to be working with the five banks on the\nMortgage Relief Fund initiative and commends them for their efforts.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and by way of recap, the weakness in the housing sector has slowed\neconomic growth in the overall economy. The collateral effects of the residential slowdown are\nlikely to be significantly affected by the path of housing prices and, importantly, how a wide\nvariety of financial intermediaries react to the current and future problems. I have offered a few\nthoughts, gleaned from history, on how I hope financial intermediaries and others will react. In\naddition, I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts\nto date — actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nNotably, there were 11 consecutive quarters of decline ending in 1958.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n3\n\nThis is not to suggest that the current downturn in residential investment is unprecedented in its severity.\nDownturns that extended from 1978 to 1982 and from 1987 to 1991 were longer but were interrupted by some “up”\nquarters. Also, the 1973-75 downturn in residential investment was arguably shortened by fiscal stimulus (large tax\nrebates) in the second quarter of 1975.\n\n4\n\nThe December Employment Situation report released January 4 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor went on to say that “Job growth in several service-providing industries, including professional\nand technical services, health care, and food services, was largely offset by job losses in construction and\nmanufacturing. Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents, or 0.4 percent.”\n\n5\n\n“Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures” by Kristopher Gerardi,\nAdam Hale Shapiro, and Paul S. Willen, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper 07-15.\n\n6\n\nThe OFHEO’s home-price index (HPI) “is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The\nHPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings\non the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family\nproperties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.”\n(Source: OFHEO website – www.ofheo.gov)\n7\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller® Home Price Indices “measures the residential housing market, tracking changes in the\nvalue of the residential real estate market in 20 metropolitan regions across the United States. These indices use the\nrepeat sales pricing technique to measure housing markets. First developed by Karl Case and Robert Shiller, this\nmethodology collects data on single-family home re-sales, capturing re-sold sale prices to form sale pairs. This\nindex family consists of 20 regional indices and two composite indices as aggregates of the regions.” (Source:\nStandard & Poor’s website – www2.standardandpoors.com)\n\n8\n\nThe figure is 6.1 percent for the Case-Shiller average of 20 metropolitan areas, which only goes back to 2000.\n\n9\n\nSee Joe Peek & Eric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Seventeenth Annual\nVermont Economic Outlook Conference\nFriday, January 11, 2008\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nI would like to thank the organizers of this event for scheduling it after New Year’s Day,\nsince economists tend not to be particularly helpful for holiday cheer but quite useful when\nthinking of New Year’s resolutions. On your list of New Year’s resolutions, I would include not\nlistening to pundits who claimed:\n\n1) …that housing prices could not go down, nationally;\n2) …that triple-A ratings meant no default risk;\n3) …that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products.\n\nMy talk today will touch on all three, because I am going to discuss recent trends in residential\nreal estate, and their economic relevance. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday I am going to examine two prior periods of declining house prices – with some\nobservations on how they were addressed, the similarities and differences from our situation\ntoday, and the lessons we can draw. Throughout, I will refer to actions being pursued by a wide\nvariety of actors including the Federal Reserve, financial institutions, investors, borrowers, and\npolicymakers.\n\nRecent Trends in Residential Investment\nIn 2007, residential investment 2 was the laggard among the components of Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). Residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006,\nand has continued to decline in each quarter since. It seems all but certain that residential\ninvestment also declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 – and many economic forecasts expect\nresidential investment to continue to decline at least through the first half of 2008.\nHow should we interpret what could be nine or more continuous quarters of declining\nresidential investment? Exhibit 1 provides some initial context. Should the forecasts prove to be\nright, we will have experienced a longer string of back-to-back quarters of declining residential\ninvestment than at any other time in the past 50 years. 3, 4\nThat historical observation should focus our attention, but must also be tempered\nsomewhat by the unique aspects of our current situation. Let me be clear – this is an unusual\neconomic situation and we cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. For one thing, to date\nthis decline in residential investment has occurred in an economic environment of reasonably\nhealthy job and income growth, and low rates of unemployment – although the December Labor\nDepartment report, released last Friday, suggests less welcome developments, as the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nunemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December while non-farm payroll employment was\nessentially unchanged (an increase nationwide of 18,000). 5\nPrevious periods where residential investment declined for a year or more were either\naccompanied by, or closely followed by, an economic downturn. But history may or may not\nrepeat itself, because this period of prolonged weakness in housing is distinctive in several other\nways that add to uncertainty over its ultimate impact on the broader economy.\nFor one thing, most other periods of extended decline in residential investment were\npreceded by rising inflation rates, which in turn induced a policy response – usually in the form\nof a significant tightening of monetary policy (that is, increases in interest rates) [see Exhibit 2].\nHowever, the current period of weakness in housing has occurred despite a low inflation rate and\nlow real interest rates, by historical standards.\nAnother difference has been the national nature of the decline in housing prices.\nHistorically, housing prices have often shown sharp swings in particular states or regions, but it\nwas unusual for prices to fall nationwide.\nThrough the 1980s there were a series of rolling regional downturns that resulted in big\nfluctuations in regional housing prices. These were generally due to significant regional\neconomic factors, such as the surge in oil prices in the late 1970s that disproportionately boosted\nthe southwestern portion of the country. When oil prices then fell by nearly half in the early\n1980s, this same region experienced sharp drops in home prices. Similarly, the northeast’s\nhouse-price cycle of the 1980s and early 1990s was a regional phenomenon, as the promise of a\nnew technology-based “economic miracle” proved too good to be true.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn these earlier episodes, housing finance was still dominated by local financial\ninstitutions; and house price declines were regional, not national, and were not particularly well\nsynchronized with national recessions.\nThe regional nature of these housing problems is illustrated in Exhibit 3, which plots\nchanges in real estate prices by census region. Movements of housing prices in various regions\nduring the 1980s – shown on the far left side of the chart – were not particularly correlated.\nHousing prices in some regions went up despite significant declines in other regions. The\nOFHEO national house price index did not decline, giving some analysts a false sense of\nconfidence that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate loans would perform at least\nreasonably well, since real estate prices were dominated by local effects.\nThen, over the 1990s, there was less regional variation in housing price appreciation and\nmore of a common trend, which has become more pronounced recently. Greater correlation of\nhousing price increases and decreases across regions of the country meant that the diversification\nbenefit resulting from holding a national portfolio of real estate loans was significantly less than\nhistory would imply.\nWith housing price changes more correlated across regions, mortgage securities and\nderivatives of mortgage securities behaved differently than many investors had assumed they\nwould. The Boston Fed’s research 6 shows that, in large part due to widespread house-price\ndeclines, foreclosures have risen sharply in much of the country – not just in regional pockets.\nMany of the investment products consisting of securitized mortgages assumed more favorable\nhouse-price trends, so many that carried triple-A ratings have been downgraded to below\ninvestment grade – or are trading as if they were downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn part, the trend towards securitizing mortgage loans allowed the financing arrangements\nto be driven by national rather than regional conditions. As long as investor demand for higheryielding mortgage securities and derivatives was strong, there was little of the natural “governor”\nthat occurs when financial institutions become unduly concentrated in particular regions or asset\nclasses. This change enabled the supply of financing, particularly to riskier borrowers, to expand\nrapidly in all regions of the country.\nExhibit 4 illustrates how abruptly the pattern in house prices has changed. The home\nprice indexes generated by both the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight\n(OFHEO) 7 and S&P/Case-Shiller 8 show that home prices that accelerated during the first half of\nthe decade have been quickly reversing that trend.\nAs of the close of the third quarter, the S&P/Case-Shiller index indicates that house\nprices are down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite 10 monthly\nindex, representing the average of 10 large metropolitan areas, provides more recent data and has\ndeclined by 6.7 percent over the last year. 9 This is the largest decline in the 21-year history of\nthe index.\nThere has also been significant variation across metropolitan areas, illustrated in Exhibit\n5. The largest decline among the 10 metro areas was in Miami, where prices have declined by\n12.4 percent over the past year, while Denver’s decline was just 1.8 percent.\nWhile real estate has not generally experienced the volatility of many financial\ninstruments, large regional price declines over a relatively short period of time can, and have,\noccurred. And if regional price declines are becoming more tightly correlated, as some of this\nsuggests, a more significant national house price decline cannot be ruled out.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe sharp declines experienced in many regions of the country have occurred despite low\nreal interest rates and, until December, an unemployment rate below 5 percent. This highlights a\nrisk to the housing sector going forward: Since prices have declined substantially even in a\nrelatively benign economic environment, one cannot discount the possibility that they could fall\nmore rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008.\n\nThe Real Effects of Housing Price Declines\nWhile the outlook for housing will be greatly affected by the economy, history indicates\nthat “institutional” factors can also play an important role. It is instructive to compare our\ncurrent situation with earlier episodes of falling housing prices. Two very different scenarios,\nand outcomes, are illustrated by experiences in New England and Japan.\nTo give you a peek at the punch line, let me mention up front what I think the broadest\nlessons are:\n First, that transparency matters, and is generally beneficial;\n Second, that prompt recognition of losses leads to a more efficient outcome – if\nsomewhat more pain in the short run;\n Third, that adjustments are easier in an orderly economic environment with a wellfunctioning financial system. This is something the Federal Reserve is working to\nhelp ensure.\n\nNew England’s Experience\nExhibit 6 illustrates the significant decline in house prices that occurred in New England\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast to the current period, many of those loans were\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nheld by local financial institutions. As prospects for the New England economy boomed in the\nmid to late 1980s, these financial institutions significantly increased their portfolio of\nconstruction, residential, and commercial real estate loans.\nFinancial institutions were regionally based, so they were highly susceptible to regional\nshocks. When the New England economy subsequently faltered, the real estate market\ncollapsed. Prices on both residential and commercial real estate declined, resulting in losses to\nbanks’ loan portfolios. Many financial institutions found that they were inadequately diversified\nand had inadequate capital to absorb losses.\nThe supervisory process forced banks to recognize these losses. A key component of the\nbank examiner’s job is to insure that problem loans are appropriately recognized on bank balance\nsheets. Accordingly, banks were forced to write down the value of real estate loans to reflect\ndeclines in the value of the underlying collateral, and the reduced ability of borrowers to service\ntheir loans. In fact, very large declines in bank assets frequently occurred at the time of bank\nexaminations. 10\nThe large losses sustained by banks in that era resulted in 115 banks failing. 11 The\ncombination of failed banks and significant losses at surviving banks limited the supply of credit\nto bank-dependent borrowers, many of whom were engaged in businesses not directly related to\nreal estate. Many of the problem loans ended up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), which expedited the necessary adjustment process by quickly disposing of\nthe collateral property.\nThe prompt action of the bank examiners and the FDIC was, and remains, controversial.\nThe swiftness of the write-downs and disposal of troubled assets initially aggravated the decline\nin residential and commercial prices. But it also meant that prices fell to the point that many\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninvestors became convinced that subsequent capital gains were inevitable. Thus, while the\ndecline in prices was steep, the duration of the problem was probably shortened by aggressive\nand transparent actions. Within four years of the trough, housing prices had already returned to\ntheir previous peak.\n\nJapan’s Experience\nOne can think of the New England experience, and the swift action of examiners, as one\nend of a continuum. At the other end is the experience in Japan. As the 1990s began, stock\nprices and real estate prices peaked. While stock prices fell relatively quickly, real estate prices\ndeclined much more gradually.\nKeenly aware of the credit-crunch experienced in the United States, Japanese regulators\nchose to move slowly in forcing write-downs of problem assets. In fact, in the early 1990s there\nwas relatively little official information published on the extent of problems. To prevent writedowns, problem assets were not revealed publicly. This lack of transparency and disclosure\nmade many investors and counterparties wary of Japanese financial institutions, as the magnitude\nof problems was difficult to discern. In addition, financial institutions and the government\naccumulated problem assets, which they held rather than disposing of the assets at “distress”\nprices.\nWhile reported prices in real estate declined slowly, volume was limited by investors’\nconcerns that the large pool of problem assets would eventually need to be sold in the market.\nWhile bank lending did not decline abruptly, several studies have indicated that lending was\nquite inefficient – often used to prop up distressed borrowers rather than to allocate credit in the\neconomy more efficiently. 12\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe overall result was that real estate prices declined for over a decade [see Exhibit 7].\nMirroring the gradual decline in prices, the recovery in prices was similarly very slow. The\neconomy experienced subpar growth for an extended period of time.\n\nWhile our current period is different in many ways from the New England and Japan\nexperiences with declining real estate prices, there are lessons to be drawn.\nFor one, the degree of transparency in financial statements can significantly affect\nconfidence in financial institutions. Uncertainty about asset values may ultimately be worse than\nlosses.\nIn the past cases of New England and Japan, and today as well, there are concerns about\nthe value of the underlying assets complicating matters. In New England the problem\nmanifested itself because real estate, especially commercial real estate, changes hands relatively\ninfrequently – particularly in a slump – and thus is difficult to value. The slow recovery of\nJapanese financial institutions was in part related to significant concerns about their true\nfinancial condition, as many of the assets held by banks in Japan were loans to finance assets\nwhich changed hands relatively infrequently. The complex, opaque nature of many of today's\nmortgage-derivative instruments also makes them very difficult to value, which in turn makes\nthem relatively illiquid.\nHistory suggests it is at such times that enhanced transparency can help clarify the extent\nof the problems, and allow financial market participants to determine appropriate valuations for\nassets and whether valuation methods are being conservatively applied. I am hopeful that the\nmanagement of firms with large exposures to securitized subprime mortgages will embrace more\ndetailed disclosures that allow for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the problems.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nFinancial institutions with poor transparency are likely to have greater difficulty raising external\nfunds at favorable prices; and indeed, we have seen significant tiering along these lines in the\nfederal funds market and other credit markets.\nLooking at the New England and Japan experiences, let me be clear that I am not\nadvocating responses to today’s problems that are at either extreme of the continuum. But\ncertainly we can learn what not to do from Japan’s experience. Clearly it is better to take care of\nproblems now than distort and greatly prolong the needed adjustment process.\nAlong with greater transparency, the New England experience reminds us that a full\nrecognition of losses will create incentives for firms to dispose of bad assets. However, we face\nan added challenge today. When problem loans were held in commercial banks, much of the\nloss recognition was enforced through the bank-examination process. With today’s opaque\nfinancial products held in a variety of financial intermediaries – not just traditional commercial\nbanks, and located both in the U.S. and abroad – the loss recognition is not likely to be\nconsistently enforced.\nMaintaining confidence in financial institutions and financial markets is key to a quick\nrecovery from a crisis. Falling real estate prices caused a credit crunch during the early 1990s\nNew England downturn, as banks reduced lending to borrowers in general as a result of the\nbanks’ capital-adequacy problems. In Japan, problem real estate loans caused banks to\nmisallocate credit to inefficient projects to prevent recognition of their problems. However, in\ntoday’s situation we are fortunate that most financial institutions have entered the current\nproblems with significant capital cushions and that many U.S. financial institutions are moving\nto proactively address the problems.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nHowever, the potential for a credit crunch remains. Commercial banks are still an\nimportant source of liquidity and there are troubling developments at work. Allow me to delve\nfor a moment into banking finance to make this point.\nMany commercial banks participated in the subprime market by sponsoring off-balance\nsheet investment vehicles. These vehicles were financed by short term commercial paper. In\nmany cases, subprime loans were only a small fraction of the asset holdings of these vehicles.\nHowever, investors are very leery of anything associated with subprime loans and are reluctant\nto buy the commercial paper of these vehicles.\nFor both reputational and legal reasons, some of the sponsoring banks are now moving\nthese off-balance sheet instruments onto their balance sheets, funding them as part of the bank\nportfolio. As shown in Exhibit 8, bank assets have grown significantly since the financial\nturmoil emerged in July. However, banks have capital requirements that limit their ability to\nexpand. Thus, there is a risk that this unintended growth in bank assets will squeeze out loans to\nother borrowers.\n\nRisk Mitigation by the Federal Reserve\nIn the midst of this recent financial turmoil, I am hopeful that actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve will reduce the potential negative impact.\nMy view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of\na more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling housing prices further weaken the\nincentives for residential investment, but are also likely to dampen consumer and business\nconfidence and spending. Furthermore, falling house prices roil financial markets and financial\ninstitutions by exacerbating exposures to the housing market.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the Federal Reserve can minimize the severity and\nspillover of housing and associated weakness by implementing policies that foster a sound\nmacroeconomic environment, low and stable inflation rates and a well-functioning financial\nsystems. In that regard, the Fed has reduced its key policy rate by 100 basis points over the past\nfive months.\nAlso, in an effort to help return markets to more normal short-term funding patterns, the\nFederal Reserve has initiated a new Term Auction Facility or TAF. The TAF enables banks with\nilliquid collateral to borrow from the discount window at a price determined by an open auction.\nThis innovative tool has the potential to provide greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to\nrespond to the sort of liquidity problems that we have seen in recent months. The benefit to\nbanks is that they can borrow relatively low-cost funds using assets that are temporarily illiquid\nas collateral. This facility is particularly useful in providing term lending, and appears to have\nbeen helpful as financial institutions sought liquidity at the end of 2007.\nThe first two auctions have provided term funding at a rate above the overnight federal\nfunds rate but below the primary credit rate that banks borrow from the Fed’s Discount Window.\nAn added benefit of the TAF is that it allows the Fed to supply funds to the market without\nadding to stresses in Treasury markets by engaging in direct purchases of Treasury securities.\nTreasury markets have experienced significant stress in recent months, as Treasury issues were\nin great demand by investors around the world who sought safe, liquid assets. 13\n\nOn a more regional note, the New England states have seen a falloff in housing\nconstruction and home sales roughly comparable to that of the nation. Housing prices, which\ngrew very rapidly from 1998 to 2005, have leveled off and in three New England states –\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire – prices are down from a year ago. 14 While\nVermont's experience is more favorable than that of the other New England states, the picture is\nbroadly similar.\nAs housing prices have leveled off or declined in New England, foreclosure rates have\nrisen from well below the national average to the national average, which is also rising. Again,\nVermont's experience is more favorable than the rest of New England: Its foreclosure rates as of\nthe third quarter of last year were only half the national and the regional averages.\nThe increase in foreclosures has been particularly sharp for subprime adjustable rate\nmortgages. The typical subprime adjustable rate mortgage is a hybrid, with a fixed rate of about\n8 percent for two years that resets to about 11 percent. The surge in foreclosures thus far is not\ndue to resets. However, many borrowers holding subprime loans face resets in the coming year,\nindeed the next few quarters. This prospect threatens to make a difficult situation even worse.\nSo I am very pleased that five large New England banks have formed a consortium to\nreach out to subprime borrowers to see whether they might be candidates for loans at prime rates,\nmaking use of existing federal and state insurance programs. This initiative, called the Mortgage\nRelief Fund, was launched shortly before Christmas with a $125 million commitment from the\nfive banks and has already has some success in generating inquiries. Exhibit 9 is an excerpt from\nthe effort's web site.\nTo date the banks – Bank of America, Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth,\nand Webster Bank – have had over 430 calls from borrowers, and a number of them are\nbeginning the application process or have already submitted loan applications. Because\nborrowers can qualify for government-insured loan programs with as little as 3 percent equity in\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe house, this is an important initiative for borrowers to consider if they are currently holding\nsubprime loans.\nThe challenge, really, is getting the word out and convincing borrowers who may face\ntrouble in coming months that it is in their best interest to act now.\nSo I strongly encourage homeowners paying a high subprime rate, and possibly facing a\nrate-reset to an even higher level, to visit the website – www.MortgageReliefFund.com – to\nbegin exploring whether they would be better off financially by taking advantage of this\nprogram.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is pleased to be working with the five banks on the\nMortgage Relief Fund initiative and commends them for their efforts.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and by way of recap, the weakness in the housing sector has slowed\neconomic growth in the overall economy. The collateral effects of the residential slowdown are\nlikely to be significantly affected by the path of housing prices and, importantly, how a wide\nvariety of financial intermediaries react to the current and future problems. I have offered a few\nthoughts, gleaned from history, on how I hope financial intermediaries and others will react. In\naddition, I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts\nto date — actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nGDP is essentially the value of goods and services put in place during a time period. Residential investment is the\nhousing component of GDP. “The main indicator of the quantity of new housing supplied to the economy is the\nresidential fixed investment series from the national income and product accounts. Residential investment is made\nup of new construction put in place, expenditures on maintenance and home improvement, equipment purchased for\nuse in residential structures (e.g., washers and dryers purchased by landlords and rented out to tenants), and\nbrokerage commissions.” (Source: “Residential Investment over the Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter #2006-15; June 30, 2006). \"Brokers’ commissions…are\npart of the cost of acquiring a house and, therefore, a capital expenditure.\" (Source: \"National and Regional\nHousing Patterns\" by Lynn Elaine Browne in the New England Economic Review, July/August 2000, published by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).\n\n3\n\nNotably, there were 11 consecutive quarters of decline ending in 1958.\n\n4\n\nThis is not to suggest that the current downturn in residential investment is unprecedented in its severity.\nDownturns that extended from 1978 to 1982 and from 1987 to 1991 were longer but were interrupted by some “up”\nquarters. Also, the 1973-75 downturn in residential investment was arguably shortened by fiscal stimulus (large tax\nrebates) in the second quarter of 1975.\n\n5\n\nThe December Employment Situation report released January 4 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor went on to say that “Job growth in several service-providing industries, including professional\nand technical services, health care, and food services, was largely offset by job losses in construction and\nmanufacturing. Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents, or 0.4 percent.”\n\n6\n\n“Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures” by Kristopher Gerardi,\nAdam Hale Shapiro, and Paul S.

The\nHPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings\non the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family\nproperties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.”\n(Source: OFHEO website – www.ofheo.gov)\n8\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller® Home Price Indices “measures the residential housing market, tracking changes in the\nvalue of the residential real estate market in 20 metropolitan regions across the United States.

        "content": "Discussion: The Mortgage Meltdown – Implications for Credit Availability\nEric S. Rosengren, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum, February 29, 2008\n\nI am very pleased to be able to discuss the paper \"Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the\nMortgage Meltdown” by Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap and Shin (GHKS).\nIt is somewhat ironic that several current participants on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), including myself, wrote extensively about the credit crunch period in the\nearly 1990s and now have the opportunity as policy makers to consider how financial problems\nmay be spilling over to the real economy.1 So it is particularly appropriate that the paper we are\ndiscussing today asks whether problems that originated in mortgage markets are likely to cause a\ncredit crunch that significantly impacts growth in the economy, and what that implies for central\nbanks.\nThe paper provides a variety of new facts about the current financial turmoil, and does a\nvery nice job of detailing the extent of current and potential problems that may impact future\npublic policy. I plan to first discuss the issue of the size of the losses to financial institutions\nstemming from the current financial turmoil. I will highlight both the uncertainty around the\nGHKS estimate, and the possible downside risk that may remain to their estimate. I will next\ndiscuss the issue of the impact on balance sheets. I will argue that to date, the balance sheet\nconstraints are primarily occurring at a few large institutions with significant exposure to more\ncomplicated financial products; but that again, there is downside risk that balance sheet\nconstraints could become more widespread in the future – particularly if housing prices\nexperience more significant declines. I will then amplify an issue touched on only lightly in the\n\n1\n\n\fpaper, and that is the implications of mortgage problems for securitization and complicated\nfinancial products. I will conclude with a few observations on policy.\n\nResidential Real Estate Losses – The Role of Declining Housing Prices\nGHKS use three different methods to determine mortgage credit losses. The first is a\nmigration analysis that looks at historical trends of each vintage year and then adjusts the trends\nfor falling home prices. The second extrapolates from the current pricing of mortgage-backed\nsecurities’ expected losses. The third uses foreclosure rates from previous regional periods of\nfalling housing prices, and applies those rates to the current distribution of mortgages. With\nseveral assumptions and caveats they find losses are expected to be $400 billion, with about half\nof that figure being borne by leveraged institutions.\nThe authors highlight the significant uncertainty around their estimates. This is\nparticularly appropriate since two critical components of the calculation, the path of housing\nprices and the path of the economy, are not directly estimated in the model. Analysis by Gerardi,\nShapiro, and Willen of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston2 finds the probability of a default\nand foreclosure is highly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment – particularly to house\nprice appreciation.\nIn making adjustments for falling housing prices, GHKS discuss house price declines of\n5, 10, and 15 percent from the end of 2006. While housing prices are critical to understanding\nthe extent of overall mortgage credit losses, the absence from the historical record of a sustained\nnational decline in housing prices makes it problematic to extrapolate the future solely with\nhistorical data. As shown in Table 1, all 10 major metropolitan areas followed by the CaseSchiller home-price index declined in the past year, and five of the major metropolitan areas\n\n2\n\n\fshow double-digit declines. These declines have occurred despite an unemployment rate in\nJanuary 2008 of 4.9 percent. Should the economy weaken more than expected, one can envision\ndownside risks to even the rather bleak forecast of GHKS – especially given the large number of\nhigh loan-to-value (LTV) loans made in the past three years.\nFrom a policy perspective it is important to understand not only what would happen if the\neconomy behaves as expected – which would currently be that we skirt a recession and housing\nprices show only modest declines – but also how significant the downside would be if the rise in\nthe unemployment rate and the decline in housing prices were significantly greater than currently\nexpected. The authors’ estimates of expected losses do not try to factor in the potential – though\nhopefully unlikely – outcome of housing prices interacting with sharper declines in employment\nand further financial difficulties at mortgage lenders. While not the most likely outcome, it is an\noutcome that policymakers and others may consider “taking out some insurance against.”\nAn additional factor left out of the analysis involves the nature of the housing recovery\nthat is likely to occur if the mortgage securities market and financial institutions are unwilling to\nlend to subprime borrowers. Given the recent difficulty in securitizing troubled or high LTV\nmortgage credits, and the possibility that many financial institutions will be reticent to lend to\nrisky borrowers in a declining house price market, the housing malaise could be more protracted\nand the recovery more anemic than we have experienced in previous housing downturns.\n\nBalance Sheet Constraints\nGHKS argue that the distribution of mortgage losses is important. Many of these losses\nare in leveraged financial institutions, which will be forced to shrink their balance sheets to\nmaintain desired capital ratios. Thus the analysis is in the spirit of earlier credit crunch literature\n\n3\n\n\fthat highlights that binding capital constraints at financial institutions can result in significant\nheadwinds, as experienced in the United States in the early 1990s and in Japan during the “lost\ndecade.”3\nTo date, there have been several significant differences in the distribution of losses\ncompared to the 1990s. The 1990s credit crunch resulted from regional losses in commercial\nreal estate and construction, and to a lesser degree residential investment. These losses\nessentially impacted all financial institutions in the affected region. To date in our current\nsituation, the mortgage problems have been concentrated in some of the largest financial\ninstitutions involved in structured finance and the securitization of subprime mortgages.\nIn fact, three large financial institutions alone have already announced almost $60 billion\nin write-downs in the last two quarters of 2007.4 Despite the very significant write-downs, the\nlosses have been mitigated by the ability of these global institutions to attract new capital. In fact\nthese same three institutions have together announced $36 billion in new capital in the last four\nmonths (October – January).5 This ability to raise new capital has helped mitigate capital\nconstraints.\nTable 2 shows that despite large financial losses announced by some commercial banks\nin the past two quarters, many banks have experienced increases in capital and in their capital\nratios. In fact, more than two-thirds of bank holding companies had increases in capital in the\nlast two quarters of 2007. Note, however, that the decreases are more prevalent among the\nlargest bank holding companies while the increases are more prevalent among the smaller bank\nholding companies. In terms of capital ratios, 354 bank holding companies had increases in\ncapital ratios in the last two quarters of 2007, while 592 had decreases. This reflects that even at\n\n4\n\n\fbank holding companies with increased capital, the asset growth has exceeded the capital\ngrowth.\nTable 3 shows that in aggregate, while capital was basically flat, assets did increase, as\nbanks provided liquidity to many firms and financial market participants. To date, the resulting\npotential capital constraints are concentrated in the largest banks with the largest exposure to\nsecurities tied to subprime mortgages. While some of the capital losses have been mitigated by\nnew capital, the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets can potentially restrain\nthe willingness of these institutions to engage in activities that would further swell their balance\nsheet.\nBecause these institutions are actively engaged in structured products and loans to\nfinance leveraged deals, it is not surprising that participants in these markets are finding tighter\nfinancial constraints. For some markets where these banks are major market makers, the\nunwillingness to further increase balance sheets has impacted the liquidity in those markets.\nMany small and medium-sized businesses are not complaining about credit conditions.\nThis reflects the lack of exposure that many small and medium-sized banks had to securitized\nproducts or the subprime market. However, should housing prices continue to fall, losses in\nprime residential mortgages and construction loans are likely to cause these institutions to be\nmore capital constrained. Banks under $100 billion still retain significant exposure to residential\nmortgages and construction loans which account for 26 percent of assets or $750 billion. Should\nhousing prices continue to fall and the housing sector get worse, it is likely that these institutions\nwill begin being impacted more significantly.\n\n5\n\n\fSpillovers From the Mortgage Meltdown\nAn issue not directly addressed in this paper, but nonetheless critical to the discussion, is\nthe loss in confidence in the ratings process and the consequent uncertainty in the pricing of a\nwide variety of structured products.\nAs Exhibit 3.4 in GJKS highlights, AAA tranches for recently issued contracts are selling\nfor less than 70 percent of their par value. Since lower-grade tranches would experience losses\nfirst, such pricing implies very severe losses on the underlying assets. It also highlights that the\ndefault probabilities on a large number of highly-rated securities are likely to be higher than\nwould normally be expected by investors in the highest-grade securities. While the problems\nwith ratings accurately reflecting probabilities of default are primarily related to mortgage\nproducts, their impact has moved well beyond residential mortgages.\nThe largest banks have increasingly moved to an originate-to-distribute model for a\nvariety of assets formerly held on balance sheets. Leveraged loans, credit card receivables,\ncommercial real estate loans, student loans, and municipal borrowings have all increasingly been\nmoved off banks’ balance sheets and into a variety of new securities. As investors have lost faith\nin the ratings process, many of these highly-rated securities have begun to sell at significant\ndiscounts, which will likely result in additional losses.\nIn addition to the losses experienced by the holders of these securities, the borrowers\nhave had their financing disrupted. Many of these loans will need to be financed by bank\nbalance sheets, and the terms may be significantly different than what they experienced prior to\nthe recent financial turmoil.\nDifficulties in selling structured financial products have resulted in the disappearance or\nnear-disappearance of trading in some collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized\n\n6\n\n\fdebt obligations (CDOs), have disrupted the auction-rate securities market, have made it difficult\nto sell asset-backed commercial paper, have created problems for monoline insurers and have\ncaused the winding down of many structured investment vehicles. Many of these markets\nfinanced assets above and beyond mortgages, and as a result may produce losses not captured in\nthe analysis by GHKS. While problems in rating mortgages may have been the trigger, the\ndrying up of the market for structured financial products is a downside risk and could make it\nmore difficult or more expensive to meet the financing needs of a variety of organizations.\n\nPublic Policy\nGHKS express some pessimism regarding the ability of monetary policy to help mitigate\nproblems. I am less pessimistic. Most subprime loans had reset rates tied to the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) – generally around 6 percentage points over the six-month\nLIBOR. The reductions in the federal funds rate, as well as the reduction in the spread of\nLIBOR over the federal funds target after the introduction of the Federal Reserve’s Term\nAuction Facility, have significantly reduced the reset rate for most subprime borrowers (Figure\n1). For many borrowers, the reset rate may at this point not be dramatically different than the\noriginal rate – a significant difference from what would have occurred in the absence of\nappropriately aggressive monetary policy.\nIn addition, lower rates are likely to result in higher house prices than would occur in the\nabsence of monetary easing. This should reduce the foreclosure rate and reduce some of the\nconcern that housing problems will become more widespread. Finally, lower rates should result\nin less unemployment – one of the main drivers in forced sales of houses. Thus, monetary policy\nactions may significantly reduce the depth of problems, but are of course not a panacea.\n\n7\n\n\fMany of the possible steps to mitigate these problems involve policy solutions not tied to\nmonetary policy. In recent years the subprime market became the major avenue for low- and\nmoderate-income borrowers to buy homes. There would seem to be a strong economic incentive\nfor borrowers to seek FHA insurance and get a prime rather than a subprime rate. Examining\nhow FHA programs could continue to be modernized and streamlined and become a more viable\nchoice for borrowers may be an important mitigant for housing problems.\nGiven falling housing prices, many financial institutions are likely less willing to be\nexposed to the mortgage market. One aspect of the current situation is the high LTV ratios\nfacing many borrowers, as low down-payments and falling housing prices have made refinancing\nhomes difficult. A possible solution would be shared appreciation loans with FHA guarantees.\nThis approach, variants of which are currently being discussed, would provide the FHA and the\nlending institution with a portion of future appreciation in return for providing the FHA\ninsurance on high LTV loans.\nWhile too large a topic for today’s discussion, I believe there is also a need to increase\ntransparency and create more consistent prices for complex financial products. We need to think\nabout the ramifications and possible remedies of a situation where parties are unable to\naccurately value financial assets tied to the mortgage market – a market whose prices are more\neasily determined than are many other types of balance sheet assets.\n\nConclusion\nGHKS have done a nice job of highlighting some of the ramifications of the mortgage\nmeltdown. A critical factor in the size of losses, and whether balance sheet constraints become\nmore widespread, is the extent to which housing prices fall. Unfortunately, we have little\n\n8\n\n\fhistorical precedent for sustained declines in national housing prices, which makes it difficult to\nforecast future home prices. However, one of the significant downside risks to the economy is\nthat further declines in housing prices could depress residential investment, reduce consumer\nspending, generate elevated foreclosures, and contribute to financial instability. Taking\nappropriate monetary, regulatory, and fiscal actions to mitigate this risk seems prudent.\n\n1\n\nFor example, see the following.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nSouth Shore Chamber of Commerce\nQuincy, Massachusetts\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today.\nMy goal is to share with you what I see as some “early lessons” from the ongoing\nperiod of turmoil in real estate and credit markets. 1 It is important, given the turbulence\nwe have lately experienced, to begin to analyze and act on such lessons as early as\npossible.\nFirst, some background. For the past two years, the housing market has gone\nfrom bad to worse. What began as a mild reduction in residential investment 2 at the start\nof 2006 has accelerated, with residential investment declining by more than 20 percent\nduring each of the last two quarters of 2007.\nBeyond the obvious and intense pain for distressed borrowers, a noteworthy\naspect of this downturn in residential investment has been its impact on financial markets.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nPrevious housing downturns caused problems for savings institutions and banks that were\ngenerally smaller than the large financial institutions being affected today. This\ndownturn has primarily affected financial markets and large financial institutions. Large\nfinancial institutions have lost billions of dollars, and in some cases tens of billions; and\nsome are forecasting significant additional losses. 3\nBut this is not just a Wall Street problem. Our real concern is the ways those\nproblems in financial markets translate back to all of us.\nAfter a brief background on the genesis of the current financial turmoil, I am going\nto discuss three issues that I am sure you are increasingly seeing reported on the business\npages of your national and regional newspapers:\n\n First I will discuss why the accuracy of ratings on securitized mortgage\nproducts have been so much less reliable than ratings for corporate-debt\nsecurities, and the lessons we should draw from those differences. Here is a\npeek at the main message: uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety\nof markets to become less liquid. Less liquid credit markets can hurt borrowers\nof every type. Problems with the accuracy of ratings had their roots in the\ndeterminants of the ratings – and so we need ways to differentiate ratings that\nhave different “drivers” in terms of the credit risk on the underlying assets. We\nneed for example, to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from\nratings on assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different,\nand less well understood, like certain mortgages-related securities.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n Second, I will touch on the difficulty in pricing complex financial instruments,\nand actions that might help with transparency and pricing of these products in\nthe future. Again, the main message: As I see it, the recent difficulty in pricing\nassets should make investors and financial intermediaries consider whether such\ncomplexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more\nstandardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded\ninstruments.\n\n Third, I will discuss the continuing problems in the housing market, and touch\non the ongoing discussion of policies that might help mitigate those problems.\nHere I’ll suggest that, if housing prices continue to fall, we will need to\nincreasingly consider programs for those with negative as well as positive equity\nin their houses.\n\nBackground On Recent Financial Turmoil\nFirst, a bit of background. In early 2007 it became apparent that delinquencies on\nsubprime 4 mortgages issued after 2004 were experiencing problems at a more rapid rate\nthan would be expected, given the rather benign economic environment. We began to see\nan elevated rate of subprime delinquencies [Figure 1].\nIn July of 2007, rating agencies began to highlight the fact that subprime\nmortgages that had been securitized – a process I’ll describe in a moment – were\nperforming poorly, leading to downgrades for securities that had significant exposure to\nthe subprime market. Just as investors became more uncertain about valuing these\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nsecurities, it became clear that subprime mortgages were part of various financial\ninstruments that had been viewed as generally low risk.\nSecuritization relied on the reasonable premise that subprime loans might be more\nrisky than prime, but the majority would not default – and higher interest rates and fees\nwould compensate for those that did. Subprime loans were bundled for investors and\n“riskiness” was tiered. Investors in the least risky tiers were thought to be well protected\nfrom losses. 5 [Figure 2] Unfortunately, underlying assumptions proved inaccurate.\nThe market for short-term asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), short-term\nsecurities used to finance a variety of loans from student loans to home equity, has been\nparticularly impacted [Figure 3]. As problems with mortgage-related loans emerged,\nsome investors became reluctant to continue lending in the ABCP market. This reduction\nin the availability of short-term funds caused the rates on ABCP to rise; and also forced\nsome financial institutions to buy back ABCP that they could no longer refinance,\nbringing it onto their balance sheets. The combination of uncertainty over the appropriate\nrating of mortgage-related securities and the expansion of bank balance sheets caused\nsignificant pressure on the availability of short-term credit. In addition banks, as liquidity\nproviders, were expanding their balance sheets in other areas, much of which was not\nanticipated prior to the financial turmoil. Some banks have had to take write-downs on\nsome assets, and the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets have made\nsome banks more reticent to expand their balance sheets further.\nAn indication of the difficulties in short-term financing markets was the marked\nelevation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) relative to the comparable U.S.\nFed Funds target rate. LIBOR is the rate charged in a key international market for short-\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nterm lending between banks. The elevated LIBOR rate not only made it difficult for\nbanks to borrow short-term, but also raised the rates on loans tied to LIBOR -- notably\nincluding most subprime mortgages, corporate loans, and credit card debt.\nIndeed, while the initial trigger for the financial turbulence was related to\nsubprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of complicated financial\ninstruments has caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and markets that depend on\nsecuritization – including state and municipal financing, student loans, and commercial\nreal estate. The effects have been felt up and down Main Street, as well as in some\nmarkets overseas. 6\n\nI.\n\nThe Role Of Credit Ratings\nWith that as background, I’d like to turn to my first subject today – the role\n\nplayed by the credit ratings used by investors to gauge the credit risk on securities.\nThe use of credit ratings for corporate bonds has been longstanding and generally\nfree from substantial concerns about the ratings’ accuracy, with a few notable\nexceptions. 7 So I think it is useful to consider the similarities and differences between\nrating corporate securities and mortgage securities, where the accuracy of ratings has\nbeen called into question. This is particularly important because much of the current\nturmoil is driven by investor uncertainty in rating difficult-to-value financial assets.\nRelative to mortgage securities, ratings on corporate securities have been time\ntested. Downgrades have been quite modest. Defaults have often been tied to recessions\nor problems specific to a given firm, such as excessive leverage or poor management\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n[Figure 4]. In addition, investors in corporate securities can rely on a wealth of external\nsources to verify the health of a firm. 8\nCorporate ratings have generally performed well. Despite the recent financial\nturmoil, corporate default probabilities in aggregate remain quite low [Figure 5]. With\nrelatively few downgrades, and delinquencies, the corporate balance sheet has held up\nbetter than that of the consumer – although the recent widening of spreads for lowergrade bonds gives one pause [Figure 6].\nThe mortgage market is quite different. Most mortgage securities are based on a\ndiversified pool of underlying mortgages. Many investors assumed that there would be\nsignificant benefits from diversification, that regional real estate shocks would be\ndominated by local factors, and that national home prices were very unlikely to decline.\nThese assumptions proved to be wrong, resulting in widespread downgrades of mortgage\nsecurities.\nThe housing price assumption in particular has been critical, and many investors\nmay have significantly underestimated a potential national housing price decline and its\neffect on defaults. The S&P Case-Shiller national home price index fell 10 percent from\nits peak in the second quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007. Home prices\nare down in every one of the 20 large metro areas covered by the Case-Shiller national\nhome price index.\nIn contrast to corporate securities, corroborating information on mortgage\nsecurities is not as readily available. There is no equivalent to equity analysts and equity\nprices to give investors updated market information. The information needed to analyze\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe individual mortgages in the pool can be expensive to obtain. So investors are more\nreliant on rating agencies than they are with corporate securities.\nThe problems in the mortgage market highlight the need for caution where there\nhas been limited ratings history, where the underlying characteristics that drive the asset’s\nprice may not be fully understood or anticipated, and where evaluations cannot be easily\ncorroborated by others such as equity analysts. 9 Certainly one way to highlight these\ndifferences is to differentiate ratings on corporate securities from ratings on assets like\nmortgage-backed securities.\n\nII.\n\nTransparency and Disclosure\nNow I’d like to turn to a second area, transparency and disclosure. The\n\nheightened uncertainty surrounding ratings has been aggravated by the lack of\ntransparency in the pricing of complex financial instruments. Because as many of the\nmore complicated financial instruments have ceased active trading, determining a market\nprice has become quite difficult.\nWhile defaults in housing move rather slowly, the pricing of financial assets has\nmoved much more dramatically, causing many financial institutions to significantly\nchange their expectation of losses from these complex financial instruments. In fact, the\nhighest-graded securities are selling at a very significant discount [Figure 7], implying a\nsignificant risk premium for holding even the highest quality securities of some complex\nfinancial instruments.\nThe opaqueness in pricing has caused a variety of complications:\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n First, many securities have become illiquid, and sales are only occurring at\n“distress” pricing. 10\n\n Second, the uncertainty in pricing has caused a loss of confidence in firms that\nprovided insurance on high-graded securities. This has been a problem for\ncertain municipal securities, and instruments known as auction-rate securities 11\nand variable-rate demand notes 12 where uncertainty in bond insurance has led\nto changes in pricing for securities previously thought to have little risk of\ndefault.\n\n Third, banks often provide liquidity backstops should securities trading\nbecome illiquid, and the current market turmoil is leading banks to be more\ncautious in lending because they are not sure if or when investor demand could\nevaporate, requiring significant extensions of bank credit.\n\n Fourth, certain markets have been disrupted, as investors avoid complex\nsecurities where liquidity could be a problem. The recent reports of problems\nin auction rate securities, suggest that financing for all sorts of entities –\nuniversities or hospitals or some municipalities – can get a lot more expensive\nwhen investors lose confidence in the pricing and liquidity of financial\ninstruments.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nSo, what lesson should we derive from some of these complications?\n\nFirst, some financial products were not well designed to withstand liquidity\nproblems. To avoid paying banks fees to provide a liquidity backstop, many financial\nproducts of recent vintage included provisions to force liquidation when necessary to\ninsure payment to the holders of the higher-graded securities (or slices of securities).\nThis structure was used, for example, by structured investment vehicles (SIVs) 13 .\nHowever, due to the recent financial stress, assets of SIVs could not be liquidated at\nprices felt to be reasonable. Broadly speaking, products should be structured to better\nweather periods of illiquidity, and ratings models should take better account of liquidity\nrisk.\nA second way to improve price discovery would be to have greater uniformity in\nfinancial products. Standardization of products makes it much easier to price and trade\nsecurities. A case in point: many of the positive innovations in mortgage markets\nresulted from more uniform standards for conforming loans. Standardization helped\ninsure minimum underwriting standards. 14 Non-conforming mortgage markets, as well\nas other securitized assets, might well benefit from greater uniformity and standardization\nso that pricing is less idiosyncratic to the particular security an investor holds. 15\nA third possibility is to seek more trading of financial products in exchanges\nrather than through dealers. Securities that are consistent enough to trade on an exchange\nare more likely to have market prices that all participants can use. 16\nFinally, investors should give careful consideration to whether such complex\nfinancial products are necessary at all. With simpler and more understandable structures,\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe difficulties in obtaining market prices are likely to be significantly reduced, as are the\nconsequent uncertainties like those we are currently facing.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Housing Market\nNow I’d like to turn to the continuing problems in the housing market, and a few\n\nthoughts on policies might help mitigate those problems.\nThe housing market was the genesis of current financial turbulence, and a key\npoint is that significant further declines in home prices could greatly complicate efforts to\nresolve current problems. As housing prices fall, loan-to-value ratios will rise, in some\ncases exceeding 100 percent, reducing the number of borrowers that qualify for existing\ngovernment programs like Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans. 17 Thus when\nconsidering ways to mitigate the current housing problem, it is useful to consider\nborrowers that still have positive equity in their house, as well as those that do not.\nFundamentally, I encourage worried borrowers who hold high-rate loans to\napproach a responsible lender about refinancing. I also encourage lenders to reach out to\nborrowers, and to take a fresh look at the state and federal programs that can be of\nassistance.\nIn recent months we estimated that a fair number of borrowers with subprime\nmortgages may be able to refinance into a more affordable loan, because they had good\ncredit scores and some home equity when they got a fully documented loan on an owneroccupied property. As time goes by, however, declining home prices are eroding\nborrowers’ equity, and some are experiencing financial difficulties or mounting debt as\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe economy slows. These forces complicate the picture, and narrow the pool of readily\n“refinanceable” subprime loans.\nGiven the worsening housing scene, Boston Fed researchers recently updated\nprior work in this area in an attempt to calculate the share of people with subprime loans\nwho might qualify for FHA programs. They looked at subprime loans in Rhode Island,\nConnecticut, and Massachusetts that had full documentation, were owner occupied, had a\nloan-to-value (LTV) of no greater than 97 percent, met current FHA loan-size limits by\ncounty, were never 60 days delinquent, and had a maximum debt-to-income ratio\n(including other forms of debt) of 45 percent. 18 This approximates current FHA\nstandards.\nThey estimate that about 16 percent of borrowers with subprime loans would meet\nthose criteria. However, over time this pool is likely to shrink, as the number of\ndelinquent borrowers has been rising and housing prices have been falling, likely\nreducing the number of qualified borrowers. For borrowers that could convert their\nsubprime loan to an FHA-insured loan, saving significant money from converting from a\nsubprime to a prime rate is an alternative that should be considered.\nOne refinance option is the Mortgage Relief Fund\n(www.MortgageReliefFund.com). [Figure 8] Five large banks joined forces to set up\nthis program, with the encouragement of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to join\nforces in reaching out to borrowers with high-rate loans. The banks can help borrowers\nexplore refinancing into a more-affordable loan – maybe an FHA loan, a state-guaranteed\nloan, or a conventional loan. We believe a number of community banks will join the\neffort in the coming months.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nWith two months completed, and realizing the lags from first contact on a\nmortgage to closing, the banks have logged over 1,000 inquiries, taken in more than 50\napplications, made 115 referrals to nonprofit housing counseling services, and are now\nstarting to close some of those loans from the first applicants – with the first dozen loans\nhaving recently closed. It is a modest start, but this month we are pursuing a second\nwave of outreach, and the banks are pursuing an additional advertising push, especially in\nareas with higher concentrations of subprime loans. We see the effort as a marathon, not\na sprint, and we are refining and adding to it as we go.\nAs I noted a moment ago, as delinquencies and home prices shrink the pool of\npotential borrowers in existing Federal and state programs, an important consideration for\nlenders and policymakers involves the situations of borrowers whose loan now exceeds\nthe value of their house. Of course, any remedies need to take into account the future risk\nto taxpayers, and the incentives created for borrowers and lenders. But we need to weigh\nthat against the problems for communities that can occur with widespread foreclosures –\nincluding the negative effects on neighboring homeowners, the burden on tenants, and the\ncosts borne by municipalities and communities in addressing blight and crime in areas of\nclustered foreclosures.\nAs Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday, 19 this\nsituation calls for a vigorous response – but care must be taken in designing solutions, so\nthey represent safety and soundness for lenders and are characterized by fairness and\nminimal “moral hazard.” I would note that foreclosure costs are often substantial to\nlenders (and by extension, I would add investors) – of course it goes without saying that\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthey are painfully costly on many levels for borrowers. So there is considerable scope for\nnegotiating a mutually beneficial outcome.\nSomewhat along those lines, some parties are proposing variants of a “shared\nappreciation” loan approach. 20 Lenders could write down the loan amount to the current\nhome value, cap losses, avoid the costs associated with foreclosure, and receive a share of\nany future home appreciation when the buyer sells. The borrower could avoid\nforeclosure and reduce monthly payments. 21 The FHA could provide insurance, but\ndefray the increased risk with a share of the gains when the homeowner sells.\nApproaches like this, and other worthy ideas that are being proposed, should be debated\nby policymakers and interested parties – but without delay.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nAs I noted at the outset, the current financial turmoil is ongoing but it is not too\nsoon to consider lessons learned.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety of financial markets to\nbecome illiquid and caused very significant write-offs at major financial institutions.\nConsidering ways to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from ratings\non assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different, and less well\nunderstood, is probably a first important step.\nThe difficulty in pricing assets should make investors consider whether such\ncomplexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more\nstandardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded instruments.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn the housing area, thought will likely be needed regarding programs for those\nwith negative as well as positive equity in their houses. As long as housing prices\ncontinue to fall, the decline increases the risks to borrowers, lenders, markets and the\neconomy.\nI thank you for exploring with me today these problems that have roiled Wall\nStreet, and are beginning to significantly affect Main Street. We are facing some unique\nand complex challenges in all of these areas. Let me leave you with the thought,\nhowever, that there may be a significant cost to delaying needed actions that could restore\nconfidence in the ratings process, the pricing of financial assets, and the impact of\ndeclining house prices.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nGDP is essentially the value of goods and services put in place during a time period, and residential\ninvestment is the housing component of GDP. “The main indicator of the quantity of new housing supplied\nto the economy is the residential fixed investment series from the national income and product accounts.\nResidential investment is made up of new construction put in place, expenditures on maintenance and home\nimprovement, equipment purchased for use in residential structures (e.g., washers and dryers purchased by\nlandlords and rented out to tenants), and brokerage commissions.” (Source: “Residential Investment over\nthe Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter\n#2006-15; June 30, 2006). \"Brokers’ commissions…are part of the cost of acquiring a house and,\ntherefore, a capital expenditure.\" (Source: \"National and Regional Housing Patterns\" by Lynn Elaine\nBrowne in the New England Economic Review, July/August 2000, published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston).\n3\n\nFor example see Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin (2008), “Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the\nMortgage Meltdown.” presented at the 2008 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum on February 29, 2008. Using\nthree different methods, they conclude that mortgage related losses will be $400 billion.\n4\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than prime loans,\noften because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher\nrisk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks, especially\nsmaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans, although a few large banking\norganizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the credit\ncharacteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninclude payment delinquencies and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and\nbankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-toincome ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime\nloans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the time of origination or\npurchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime borrowers. Generally, subprime\nborrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following:\nTwo or more 30-day delinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24\nmonths; Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5\nyears; Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO)\nof 660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an\nequivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or\notherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly debt-service\nrequirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and is not meant to define\nspecific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition may not match all market or\ninstitution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a starting point from which the Agencies\nwill expand examination efforts.”\n5\n\nBased on historical experience, 70 percent or more of the securities were viewed as relatively safe and\ncould carry high investment-grade ratings. Often these higher quality securities were also repackaged into\nnew securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, making the risk tiering even less clear to the\ninvestor. If the ratings were accurate, highly rated securities containing subprime debt would have only a\nremote chance of default – similar to investment-grade securities containing prime mortgages, home equity\nloans, or student loans.\n6\n\nFinancing arrangements involving so-called auction-rate securities have experienced difficulties –\ninvestor interest in such securities waned as investors became concerned that insurers of debt might not\nhave sufficient financial capacity to meet all their obligations. In a similar vein the private student-loan\nmarket has found securitizations used to finance pools of student loans are more difficult, as investors avoid\nsecuritized financial instruments in general. And the commercial real estate market has been disrupted as\ninvestors have become reluctant to buy commercial-mortgage-backed securities.\n7\n\nIt should be noted that there was criticism of corporate ratings for a number of specific companies, such as\nEnron, earlier this decade.\n\n8\n\nMost firms that issue debt also have publicly traded equity. Equity analysts provide a variety of\nperspectives on a firm's prospects. In addition, investors often have access to default probabilities, known\nas KMV, or can observe credit default spreads to get another perspective on the accuracy of ratings. Also,\nfirm's equity and options can provide important evidence of how other investors perceive the company.\nFinally, there is a long history of the SEC enforcing disclosure rules to insure that investors have sufficient\ninformation about important corporate developments. With this plethora of corroborating data, investors\nhave a wide variety of indicators to help evaluate a firm's debt rating.\n\n9\n\nIn particular, those investors who are not well positioned to make independent credit evaluations should\nseek rated assets where the information costs for validating ratings are low.\n\n10\n\nThe recent declines in the highest-graded of some mortgage securities implies very significant losses, as\ninvestors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lower-graded securities had been\nwiped out.\n11\n\n“Auction rate securities were first offered for sale in U.S. financial markets in the early 1980s. As of the\nend of 2005, there were approximately $263 billion of auction rate securities outstanding. Many different\ntypes of issuers have issued auction rate securities – for example, closed-end funds, corporations, municipal\nauthorities and student loan organizations. Auction rate securities have generally been issued as either\nbonds or preferred stock and are designed to serve as money market-type instruments. They are purchased\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nand sold, at established intervals, through an auction-type mechanism, but have long-term maturities, or no\nmaturity at all. In the auctions, auction rate securities are purchased and sold at par. Auction rate securities\nhave also been called ‘Auction Market Preferred Stock,’ ‘Variable Rate Preferred Securities,’ ‘Money\nMarket Preferred Securities’ and ‘Periodic Auction Rate Securities.’ The interest or dividend rate of an\nauction rate security is reset at these established intervals based on an auction in which investors who\nalready hold the security (called ‘holders’) and investors who seek to acquire the security (called\n‘prospective holders’) indicate their interest in continuing to hold, or in purchasing or selling, the security\nat rates that they specify to broker-dealers, such as Merrill Lynch, who have been appointed to participate\nin the auction. The dates on which the auctions take place (the ‘auction dates’), and the interval between the\nauction dates (the ‘auction period’), vary depending on the security. The auctions commonly are every\nseven days, twenty-eight days, thirty-five days or forty-nine days, but there are also some securities for\nwhich the auctions occur daily and others for which the auctions occur at longer intervals – for example,\nevery six months or once over a multi-year period.” Source: Merrill Lynch, “Description of Merrill\nLynch’s Auction Rate Securities Practices and Procedures” (http://www.ml.com/media/70501.pdf ).\n12\n\nAs noted in updates on credit and municipal market developments by Michael Holscher, David Jones,\nEric Stein, John McGowan, and Jason Miu of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n13\n\n“A structured investment vehicle or SIV is a limited-purpose operating company that undertakes\narbitrage activities by purchasing mostly highly rated medium- and long-term, fixed-income assets and\nfunding itself with cheaper, mostly short-term, highly rated CP and MTNs. While there are a number of\ncosts associated with running a structured investment vehicle, these are balanced by economic incentives:\nthe creation of net spread to pay subordinated noteholder returns and the creation of management fee\nincome. Vehicles sponsored by financial institutions also have the incentive to create off-balance-sheet\nfunds management structures with products that can be fed to existing and new clients by way of\ninvestment in the capital notes of the vehicle.” Source: Standard & Poor’s\n(http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.article_print/2,1,1,0,1031342466642.html ).\n\n14\n\nAnd enabled investors to evaluate whether pricing of their mortgage security was appropriate given the\npricing of similar products.\n15\n\nWhile making financial products more standard involves some trade-offs – less opportunity to provide\ninvestors a more customized product – such customized products involve some down-sides when accurate\npricing requires the particular security to trade hands in order to have confidence in its market price.\n16\n\nIn addition, an exchange can very significantly reduce counterparty risk by enforcing margin\nrequirements and other mechanism, to insure counterparties meets their contractual obligations. The creditdefault swap market has grown to the point where pricing and counterparty risk could be mitigated if more\ntransactions were exchange-traded.\n17\n\n“The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the federal government, insures private loans\nthat are issued for new and existing housing... Created by congress in 1934, the FHA became part of the\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Housing (HUD) in 1965. Today the mission of\nthe FHA includes helping borrowers get amounts they qualify for, and assisting lenders by reducing their\nrisk in issuing loans.” (Source: www.FHA.com)\n18\n\nThis is an approximation of FHA practice. The FHA would qualify the borrower at the FHA rate, not the\noriginal subprime rate, so we have used 45 percent rather than 41 percent of the back-end debt-to-income.\nActual credit standards may differ from the assumption used of never more than 60 days past due. Also,\nthe FHA lending limits are in the process of changing. However, given the changes in both the economy\nand housing prices, these factors may be more important in determining who qualifies in the future.\n\n16\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n19\n\n“Reducing Preventable Mortgage Foreclosures” – March 4 speech at the Independent Community\nBankers of America Annual Convention, available at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080304a.htm.\n20\n\nThe Office of Thrift Supervision is one such party.\n\n21\n\nThe borrower would have a reduced loan balance and receive a prime rate, but would be obligated, upon\nselling, to share some of the future appreciation with the current lender and the FHA. Consider for\nexample a borrower with a loan of $110,000 and a value of the house of $100,000. The lender would write\noff $10,000 but would receive $100,000 when the loan was refinanced with FHA financing. The lender\nwould receive an option that gave the lender a share of any appreciated value in the house, for example\n20%. If the home was sold for $150,000, the lender would receive the $10,000 at time of sale. The FHA\nwould receive a share of the appreciated value in the house, for example 10%. If the home sold for\n$150,000 the FHA would receive $5000 at the time of sale. The borrower would avoid foreclosure, and\nstill receive 70% of the appreciation, or $35,000. The shared appreciation values could be designed as\ntransferable options that are recorded with the registry of deeds.\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 1\nMortgage Delinquency Rates by Loan Type\n1998:Q1 - 2007:Q3\n\nPercent Past Due 90 or More Days or in the Process of Foreclosure\n14\n12\n10\nSubprime\n8\n6\n4\nPrime\n\n2\n\nSource: Mortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey / Haver Analytics\n\n07:Q3\n\n07:Q1\n\n06:Q3\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q3\n\n05:Q1\n\n04:Q3\n\n04:Q1\n\n03:Q3\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q3\n\n02:Q1\n\n01:Q3\n\n01:Q1\n\n00:Q3\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q3\n\n99:Q1\n\n98:Q3\n\n98:Q1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2\nSimplified Representation of a Mortgage-Backed\nSecurity’s Capital Structure\n100%\n\nMortgages\n\nAAA - 70%\n\nLower-Rated - 25%\n\n0%\n\nEquity - 5%\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3\nThree-Month Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Yield,\nLIBOR, and the Federal Funds Target Rate\nJune 1, 2007 - February 29, 2008\n\nPercent\n3-Month Asset-Backed Commercial Paper\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\nFederal Funds Target\n3-Month LIBOR\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics.\n\n22-Feb\n\n8-Feb\n\n25-Jan\n\n11-Jan\n\n28-Dec\n\n14-Dec\n\n30-Nov\n\n16-Nov\n\n2-Nov\n\n19-Oct\n\n5-Oct\n\n21-Sep\n\n7-Sep\n\n24-Aug\n\n10-Aug\n\n27-Jul\n\n13-Jul\n\n29-Jun\n\n15-Jun\n\n1-Jun\n\n2.0\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4\nCommercial and Industrial Loan Delinquency Rate at\nU.S. Commercial and Savings Banks\n1991:Q1 - 2007:Q4\n\nPercent of Outstandings\n1\n\n6.0\n\n0.9\n5.0\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n4.0\nC&I Loan Delinquency Rate\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.4\n2.0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n07:Q3\n\n06:Q4\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q2\n\n04:Q3\n\n03:Q4\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q2\n\n01:Q3\n\n00:Q4\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q2\n\n98:Q3\n\n97:Q4\n\n97:Q1\n\n96:Q2\n\n95:Q3\n\n94:Q4\n\n94:Q1\n\n93:Q2\n\n92:Q3\n\n91:Q4\n\n0\n91:Q1\n\n0.0\n\nRecession\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 5\nKMV Sales-Weighted and Median\nExpected Default Frequency\nFebruary 2003 - January 2008\n\nPercent\n2.0\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\nSales-Weighted\n0.4\n\nNov-07\n\nAug-07\n\nMay-07\n\nFeb-07\n\nNov-06\n\nAug-06\n\nMay-06\n\nFeb-06\n\nNov-05\n\nAug-05\n\nFeb-05\n\nNov-04\n\nAug-04\n\nMay-04\n\nFeb-04\n\nNov-03\n\nAug-03\n\nMay-03\n\nFeb-03\n\nMay-05\n\nMedian\n\n0.0\n\nSource: Moody's KMV and author's calculations.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 6\nYield Spreads: Corporate Bonds vs. 10-Year Treasury\nJanuary 1998 - February 2008\n\nBasis Points\n700\n600\n500\n\n10-Year BBB US Industrials\n\n10-Year High-Yield US Industrials\n\n400\n300\n200\n100\n10-Year AAA US Industrials\nJan-2008\n\nJan-2007\n\nJan-2006\n\nJan-2005\n\nJan-2004\n\nJan-2003\n\nJan-2002\n\nJan-2001\n\nJan-2000\n\nJan-1999\n\nJan-1998\n\n0\n\nSource: S&P Global Fixed Income Research / Haver Analytics.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 7\nABX-HE 07-01 Tranches\nJanuary 2, 2007 - February 29, 2008.\n\nPrice\n120\n100\nBBB\n\n80\n60\n\nAAA\n\nBBB-\n\nAA\n\n40\nA\n20\n\nSource: Markit.\n\n26-Feb\n\n29-Jan\n\n1-Jan\n\n4-Dec\n\n6-Nov\n\n9-Oct\n\n11-Sep\n\n14-Aug\n\n17-Jul\n\n19-Jun\n\n22-May\n\n24-Apr\n\n27-Mar\n\n27-Feb\n\n30-Jan\n\n2-Jan\n\n0\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 8\nwww.MortgageReliefFund.com\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nBank of Korea and Bank for International Settlements Seminar\nHousehold Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy\nand Financial Stability\n\nSeoul, Korea\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nI would like to thank the Bank of Korea and the Bank for International Settlements for\nsponsoring this conference on Household Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial\nStability, and for inviting me to participate as the keynote speaker. 1 The planned sessions on\nmortgage finance, consumer credit, and securitization are all particularly topical and touch on areas\nthat, especially since July of 2007, have been of keen interest at the Federal Reserve and at central\nbanks throughout the world.\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nToday I am going to focus my remarks on the key information necessary for central banks to\nmake informed decisions during periods of financial turmoil. In particular, I am going to highlight the\nfact that non-public information about financial institutions has been extremely useful in\nunderstanding the current problems in U.S. financial markets, and in understanding how those\nproblems might factor into monetary policy decisions and other policy matters.\nAt today’s conference we have representatives from a diverse set of countries, and in those\ncountries the responsibilities of the central bank in bank supervision vary considerably. The Federal\nReserve has bank-supervisory responsibilities over bank holding companies as well as banks that\nchoose both to have a state charter and to be members of the Federal Reserve. These supervisory\nresponsibilities, I would argue, have been instrumental in dealing with the current episode of financial\nturbulence.\nIn many countries bank-supervisory roles continue to evolve, but whatever the institutional\narrangements that prevail in your countries, I would argue that hands-on experience as a supervisor\ncan be critically important to the central bank during times of stress and can significantly improve the\nability of the central bank to choose appropriate monetary policy and address problems related to\nfinancial stability.\nTo make that argument, today I am going to discuss four areas where knowledge of\nconfidential, non-public information about financial institutions has been important to central bankers.\nThis is a topic that I investigated a number of years ago with co-authors Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell.\nOur research found that confidential bank supervisory information could be used to improve central\nbank forecasts of inflation, unemployment, and Gross Domestic Product. 2\nGiven the events that have occurred since financial turmoil emerged in July, I am now even\nmore confident of the need for central banks to have the experience and perspective gained through\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nbank supervision, although the institutional arrangements to facilitate those insights are likely to vary\nby country. For me, the information gleaned from the Federal Reserve's role as a hands-on bank\nsupervisor has been particularly useful in thinking about appropriate monetary policy in the following\nfour ways.\nFirst, understanding the size of and basis for likely losses has been useful in highlighting\npotential financial stability issues, as well as in determining where credit availability may become a\nproblem. To be sure, the degree of exposure to loss that is embedded in complex financial\ninstruments has been very difficult to ascertain – for banks’ own managers, let alone bank supervisors\n– as many of the recent losses have involved complex and opaque financial instruments tied to the\nmortgage market. But that challenge notwithstanding, we know that the way that banks are likely to\nbehave is linked to the size of their current and expected future losses; and as supervisors, with access\nto internal bank documents and interactions with bank management, we can estimate them.\nSecond, banks’ balance-sheet constraints can transmit financial shocks to the real economy.\nCapital-constrained banks may be unable to provide loans or extend credit in markets where they are a\nkey source of liquidity. For central bankers to gauge potential balance sheet constraints now and in\nthe future requires a detailed understanding of a bank’s financial position, capital management\nstrategies, and likely management actions.\nThird, as problems spill over from mortgage loans to other types of credit, banks’ actions can\nhave a significant impact on macroeconomic growth. For example, reducing lines of credit on homeequity loans and on credit cards could have a significant impact on consumers and dampen economic\ngrowth.\nFourth, many of the recent proactive steps taken by the Federal Reserve relative to Discount\nWindow lending are facilitated and informed by our role as a bank supervisor. These actions, taken\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nas a lender of last resort, make the central bank a counterparty to banks – which requires an\nunderstanding of a bank’s solvency and its liquidity risk.\n\nOverview: Banks and Financial Turmoil\nOne can find numerous examples of the critical role of banks in periods of financial turmoil.\nIn the United States in the early 1990s, losses on commercial real estate and construction loans caused\ncapital-constrained banks to contract their balance sheets. The result was that even companies with\ngood business prospects found it difficult to secure adequate financing despite monetary policy’s\nefforts to lower interest rates, causing the often-cited \"headwinds in monetary policy.\"\nAnd a sizable literature indicates that in Japan, problems in the banking sector played a\nsignificant role in the so-called “lost decade.” 3 Also, in the mid 1990s, many Asian countries found\nthat their banking sector exacerbated problems that originated in real estate and foreign exchange\nmarkets. We see similar episodes in Europe as well.\nWhy do banks play such critical roles during periods of financial turmoil?\nFirst, their balance sheet structure tends to amplify the effect of economic shocks. Banks are\nhighly leveraged and highly regulated. In order to maintain their capital ratios after experiencing a\nlarge capital shock, banks must significantly shrink assets on their balance sheets – in other words, not\nmake or acquire loans – since their ability to raise capital at such times can be quite limited.\nSecond, while their role in financing business and residential investment has diminished in\nrecent decades, banks remain the primary source of liquidity during periods of financial turmoil.\nBanks extend lines of credit, and these lines are most likely to be utilized when firms are experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. However, banks provide liquidity not only to firms, but also to finance an array\nof complex financial instruments. For example, in the U.S., banks have been providing liquidity to\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nthe commercial paper markets, to off-balance sheet financial vehicles (such as conduits, special\ninvestment vehicles or “SIVs,” and the like), and for municipal financing programs (for example\nthrough auction-rate securities).\nThird, banks are often the main source of financing to smaller firms, and are key marketmakers in a variety of financial markets — one example is their role as dealers for municipal auctionrate securities. Should they choose to shrink their balance sheets, the shift can disrupt bankdependent borrowing and markets where banks are key players.\nIn sum, understanding banks is critical to understanding how financial shocks can be\ntransmitted to the real economy. Unfortunately, understanding how banks are likely to respond to\nproblems requires far more than published financial statements. While U.S. banks report detailed\ninformation on their balance sheets and their income statements, these reports do not provide\nsufficient information to allow central banks to really discern how banks are responding to problems.\n\n1. Estimating Losses\nThe current financial turbulence, like most such episodes, has unexpected sources. In 2006, I\nmet with the risk managers from a number of global banks. They highlighted at that time that they\nsaw little risk emerging from the mortgage market. While they acknowledged the rapid acceleration\nin residential real estate prices, they emphasized that banks were extremely well capitalized and that\ntheir own internal “stress tests” indicated that 10 and even 20 percent declines in real estate prices\nwould result in lower (but still positive) net income at their organizations – in other words would\nresult in a loss of earnings, not capital, for their firms. Obviously, events have been more severe than\nthat, and some of the largest financial institutions have found themselves needing to aggressively seek\na new capital infusion.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nIt is worth highlighting that the banks’ observations about being well capitalized were\naccurate. The attention that regulators have given to capital has caused banks in the United States to\nbe much better capitalized going into these difficulties than they were in the 1990s (see Figure 1).\nThe introduction of the Basel I and Basel II capital accord frameworks, and of modern risk\nmanagement techniques that focus on value-at-risk modeling, have caused banks to increase their\ncapital. Current problems would clearly be worse had this not occurred. Similarly, bank supervisors\nviewed banks as being in good financial health, as indicated by the very low number of banks\nconsidered “problem” institutions by the FDIC 4 (see Figure 2) – although there has been some\nadditional deterioration recently.\nEven with the highly publicized financial turmoil that began in July, most banks remained\nprofitable in 2007 (see Figure 3). While there have been very significant losses announced by a few\nbanks, to date the losses have been at large banks actively engaged in residential mortgage\nsecuritization. Both the number and share of banks reporting losses in 2007 are well below what was\nexperienced during the early 1990s.\nSo how is it that the stress tests by large global banks did not indicate their susceptibility to\nfalling housing prices in the United States? Most of these stress tests assumed that lower housing\nprices would cause elevated losses on construction loans and holdings of subprime 5 loans, but most of\nthe large global banks did not have significant exposure in those areas.\nWhat these stress tests crucially failed to capture was the effect of house-price declines on the\nlarge holdings of highly rated securities that global banks held – the products of mortgage\nsecuritization activities, with their payment streams ultimately tied to the performance of subprime\nloans. In particular, they thought that housing prices nationwide were unlikely to fall, but that even if\nthey did, they would only affect the high-risk slices or “tranches” of these securitized pools of\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nmortgages – and the high-risk tranches were not generally held by U.S. banks. In fact, triple-A rated\ntranches continued to trade close to par when problems in subprime loans first became apparent in\n2007 (see Figure 4 – Markit ABX.HE indices 6 ).\nHowever, since the financial turmoil starting in July, the triple-A rated securities with payment\nstreams derived from subprime loans have more recently been trading as low as 60 percent of par.\nSuch values likely reflect a significant risk premium for holding mortgage-backed assets. The size of\nthat risk premium is somewhat surprising, since the defaults on the underlying subprime assets would\nneed to be quite severe to result in such large losses for these highest-rated and most-secure tranches –\nand investors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lower-graded securities\nhad been wiped out.\nValuation has been made difficult by several factors – including uncertainty over the number\nof borrowers that may eventually default on their subprime mortgage loans as well as the liquidation\nvalue of foreclosed properties in the depressed residential real-estate market, and the large discounts\nthat market participants have placed on complex financial assets tied to subprime loans. In addition,\nthe deep discounts on highly rated securities have made investors skeptical of ratings as an indicator\nof default probabilities. With few trades happening – and many of those trades “distress sales” – the\nactual worth of many of these instruments is quite difficult to determine with confidence.\nHowever, knowing the nature of the exposure and knowing the possible pricing outcomes are\nboth critical to estimating losses that could stem from these assets. Bank supervisors have the ability\nto get detailed information on the banks’ exposures to these assets, their current pricing, and their\npossible future pricing. These insights are critical to understanding the size of likely losses to a\nfinancial institution, and management’s likely responses to the losses (given an environment of falling\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nhousing prices, and the prevalence of underwriting problems with many subprime loans originated\nafter 2004).\n\n2. The Importance of Balance Sheet Constraints\nHow banks manage their lending in the face of balance-sheet constraints can have significant\nmacroeconomic effects. If banks are unwilling to lend in the subprime and jumbo markets because\nthese loans are now difficult to securitize, the recovery of residential real estate may be impeded. If\nbanks cut back on loans to businesses, business fixed investment and investment in commercial\nproperty may be impeded. If banks choose to reduce lines of credit to consumers, consumption may\nbe impeded. These examples simply underline the fact that during a period of financial turmoil it is\nimportant for central bankers to understand the degree of balance sheet constraint, and how banks’\nmanagement may choose to respond.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, during the recent financial turmoil in the United States bank assets\nhave actually grown, particularly at the largest institutions. Banks have reduced their holdings of\ngovernment securities, but have expanded their holdings of other securities and commercial and\nindustrial loans.\nMuch of this growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in\nresponse to liquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the factors\nthat have increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial paper, 7\nfirms expanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were originated\nwith the expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing the purchase of\nmunicipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being securitized. Such\nfactors can significantly swell bank assets, placing pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull back\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nin other areas. And banks’ choices regarding which types of credit to shrink can have macroeconomic\nconsequences.\nSuch information can only be known with detailed knowledge of the bank’s assets, both onbalance sheet and off-balance sheet, and information about which business lines each institution views\nas critical in the event it is forced to shrink (in other words, to cut back on credit extension) in some\nareas.\nIndeed, calculating how constrained banks are likely to become is not straightforward. One\ncomponent is understanding the size of any possible losses that reduce banks’ capital. At the same\ntime, the likely growth in bank assets can also be very important – and it is virtually impossible to\nestimate without on-going discussions with bank management, such as occur in management’s\ndiscussions with bank supervisors.\n\n3. Potential for Spillover to Retail Consumption\nWhile the problems at many large banks originated with subprime mortgages and\nsecuritization, policymakers and others are rightly paying attention to potential spillovers. As banks\nhave seen housing prices decline, they have been reducing lines of credit associated with credit cards\nand home-equity loans. Declining home prices, which are a key driver of subprime defaults, 8 also\nerode the collateral value for home-equity lines. Thus, geographic areas that are experiencing falling\nhome prices are likely seeing less credit available on home-equity lines, even if credit scores have not\nchanged.\nSimilarly, banks are noticing – perhaps not surprisingly – that nonperforming credit card loans\nhave increased more in areas with elevated home foreclosures. 9 As a result, some banks are\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nreexamining their risk exposure for lines of credit in areas with falling home prices and elevated\nmortgage problems.\nConsumers who are informed that their credit lines have been reduced or possibly limited to\nloans outstanding lose an important financing option, which may dampen their consumption spending.\nTo the extent that untapped lines of credit serve as a precautionary source of funds, consumers may\nreduce their willingness to purchase items. And purchases will likely fall for consumers who find\nthemselves limited to current cash flow.\nLet me emphasize that it is too early to determine the degree that consumers will be restrained\nby credit availability in the current situation. But such trends will be easier to detect sooner and more\naccurately if the central bank has supervisory engagement with financial institutions.\n\n4. Bank Supervision and the Lender of Last Resort\nI would argue that it is very difficult for a central bank to be an effective lender of last resort\nwithout significant knowledge of the current and prospective value of assets and liabilities within\nfinancial institutions. Like any counterparty, a central bank acting as a lender needs to be able to\nevaluate the solvency and liquidity of a borrowing institution.\nOf course, determining future solvency of an institution can be challenging, particularly when\nassets are difficult to value. Knowing how likely it is that an institution’s sources of funds will\nevaporate during times of financial stress requires a significant understanding of the institution’s\nliabilities and its counterparty relationships. Such information has been particularly important of late,\nas the Federal Reserve has initiated a variety of innovative techniques to provide liquidity to the\nmarketplace.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nFigure 6 provides a list of the various steps taken recently by the Federal Reserve related to\nour Discount Window – steps we have taken to try to enhance market liquidity and prevent ripples of\ndifficulty that impact more institutions and ultimately the real economy and individuals. Because of\nthe complexity and institutional details involved in each of these steps taken, I will focus today only\non one, the Term Auction Facility.\nThe Term Auction Facility allows banks to obtain short-term financing using as collateral a\nsubset of assets that the marketplace is currently seeing as illiquid. It has also provided an\nopportunity for banks to get financing for approximately one month during a period when obtaining\nsuch financing has sometimes proved difficult. Every other week, the Federal Reserve holds an\nauction where banks are able to use collateral at the Discount Window to get a loan. Currently the\nsize of each auction is $50 billion. The auctions have been well received, and have generally resulted\nin financing terms (determined by the auction) that are somewhat above the Federal Funds rate.\nTo qualify, a bank first needs to be in sound financial condition, as the Federal Reserve must\nhave confidence that the bank will be solvent over the time the loan is extended. While this\ndetermination is left to the individual Reserve Bank whose district the institution resides in, it\ngenerally requires that the bank not have low supervisory ratings. Second, the institution needs to\nhave collateral at the Federal Reserve. Our Discount officers determine, as best they can, the market\nvalue of the collateral and apply an appropriate “haircut.”\nThere is little question in my mind that both the determination of the potential solvency risk\nand the evaluation of the institution’s collateral are greatly aided by having experienced bank\nsupervisors at the central bank.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nConclusion\nTwo years ago, few analysts were anticipating significant retail credit and banking problems.\nThe most recent banking problems in the United States had been driven by problems in commercial\nreal-estate loans. The current turmoil stems from troubles with residential real estate loans that are\nfor the most part only indirectly owned, through securitizations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings applied to relatively new and opaque financial products\nand the difficulty in pricing complex financial assets have seriously disrupted the “originate to\ndistribute” model of recent real estate finance. In particular, it is clear that instruments that involve\nfinancing long-term assets with short-term liabilities, without institutional liquidity backing them up,\nare not especially suited to withstand times of financial distress such as the one we are facing.\nToday I have argued that knowledge of financial institutions has been a critical component of\nmy own thinking as a central banker. In my view, central banks with potential counterparty risk as a\nlender of last resort need to have sufficient information to assess the solvency of their counterparty\nand the liquidity of its collateral – the same factors that any private counterparty would require.\nMuch of our understanding of the economy’s evolution since July has been greatly influenced\nby turmoil affecting financial markets. The economy’s path will vary depending on the size and\nnature of the problems at financial institutions, the distribution of those problems, and the reaction of\nbank management to those problems. I believe strongly that at the Federal Reserve, our role as a bank\nsupervisor within a central bank has greatly facilitated our ability to operate effectively during this\nchallenging period.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\n2\n\nSee \"Is Bank Supervision Central to Central Banking?\" by Joe Peek, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey M. B. Tootell\nin The Quarterly Journal of Economics. vol. 114 (May 1999): pages 629-653. The paper finds that confidential bank\nsupervisory information could help more accurately forecast important macroeconomic variables and is useful to monetary\npolicymaking. The findings suggest that the complementarity between supervisory responsibilities and monetary policy\nshould he an important consideration when evaluating the structure of a central bank.\nAlso see \"Does the Federal Reserve Possess An Exploitable Informational Advantage?\" by Joe Peek, Eric\nRosengren, and Geoffrey M.B.

The rating is based on a scale of\n1 to 5 in ascending order of supervisory concern. ‘Problem’ institutions are those institutions with financial, operational,\nor managerial weaknesses that threaten their continued financial viability. Depending upon the degree of risk and\nsupervisory concern, they are rated either a ‘4’ or ‘5’. For all insured commercial banks and for insured savings banks for\nwhich the FDIC is the primary federal regulator, FDIC composite ratings are used. For all institutions whose primary\nfederal regulator is the OTS, the OTS composite rating is used.” Source: Definitions section of FDIC Quarterly Banking\nProfile (Fourth Quarter 2007).\n\n5\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than prime loans, often\nbecause of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders,\ntypically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do\nnot make subprime loans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the credit characteristics of individual\nborrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that include payment delinquencies and possibly\nmore severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment\ncapacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with\nincomplete credit histories. Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the\ntime of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime borrowers. Generally,\nsubprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two\nor more 30-day delinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24 months; Judgment,\nforeclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5 years; Relatively high default\nprobability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO) of 660 or below (depending on the\nproduct/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt\nservice-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after\ndeducting total monthly debt-service requirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and\nis not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition may not match all\nmarket or institution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a starting point from which the Agencies will\nexpand examination efforts.”\n6\n\n“The ABX index represents a basket of credit default swaps linked to subprime mortgages.

This reduction in the availability of short-term funds\ncaused the rates on ABCP to rise; and also forced some financial institutions to buy back ABCP that they could no longer\nrefinance, bringing it onto their balance sheets. The combination of uncertainty over the appropriate rating of mortgagerelated securities and the expansion of bank balance sheets caused significant pressure on the availability of short-term\ncredit. In addition banks, as liquidity providers, were expanding their balance sheets in other areas, much of which was\nnot anticipated prior to the financial turmoil. Some banks have had to take write-downs on some assets, and the losses in\ncombination with involuntary growth in assets have made some banks more reticent to expand their balance sheets further.\n\n8\n\nSee “Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures,” Working Paper\nNo. W07-15 by Kristopher Gerardi, Adam Hale Shapiro, and Paul Willen, available on the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston’s website, www.bos.frb.org.\n\n9\n\nIn March 4 testimony, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn noted that delinquency rates on credit\ncards and consumer installment loans had increased over the second half of 2007.

I’ll also say\na bit about ways the Federal Reserve has tried to help address the problem, and share\nsome of my own views on what the Fed’s role can and should be in the future, informed\nby my background in both economic research and bank supervision.\nIf I were to select a light-hearted title for my remarks, it might be “Fear and\nLoathing on Wall Street.” The basic premise is that as firms have become increasingly\nconcerned about the valuation (pricing) of certain assets, their ability to accurately assess\ncounterparty risk and the liquidity position of counterparties has become clouded. The\nlack of transparency in the prices of underlying assets, and the significant losses of some\nfinancial firms whose deteriorating situation had not been evident in earlier financial\nstatements, have together made investors skittish. As a result, financial firms are\nincreasingly willing to pass up the use of other attractive financing opportunities if they\nbelieve that action might lead to speculation about the liquidity or financial strength of\ntheir firm.\nWhile such skittishness is not unusual during periods of illiquidity, it is unusual\nfor a period of illiquidity to last this long.\nI would like to provide a simple, non-financial example of the problems\nassociated with signaling, and then proceed to describe some ways that these signaling\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nissues can complicate decisions related to short-run borrowing from the Federal Reserve,\nand affect credit markets more generally.\nLet me say at the outset that concerns about signaling, stigma, and market\ninformation are one reason why the Federal Reserve can play, should play, and has\nplayed a significant role as a liquidity provider. Unlike private market participants, the\nFederal Reserve has no incentive to profit from knowledge of a counterparty’s situation,\nmaking it a preferred counterparty during times of financial turmoil.\n\nA Brief, Non-Financial Example\nI am going to begin with a simple example of signaling that is personal, and\nunrelated to financial markets. I have always been an avid tennis player – although\n“avid,” unfortunately, does not necessarily translate to “accomplished.” I have had the\ngood fortune to pass my enthusiasm for the game on to my son.\nAs he moved to adolescence it was clear that his game had surpassed mine in\nevery dimension. Yet, his success was hampered by a simple signaling mechanism.\nWhen something in my play created a particular difficulty for him, he highlighted the\ndifficulty by throwing his racquet. Fortunately, today's tennis racquets are made from\nalloys that help the Space Shuttle re-enter the atmosphere.\nIt does not take a very wily tennis competitor to realize that the optimal strategy is\nto repeat the same circumstances which frustrated or trumped the opponent – a tactic that\nresulted in an even more impressive trajectory for the racquet. Like my ability to surmise\nand exploit my son’s primitive signaling mechanism, financial market participants are\nhighly sensitive to signals offered by their competitors. And no financial institution\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwants to do the equivalent of signaling a vulnerability by throwing their racquet –\nparticularly with far more at stake than a family tennis match.\n\nDiscount Window Signaling\nSimilarly, firms’ concerns about signaling have hampered the ability of the\nFederal Reserve to encourage borrowing from the Discount Window during times of\nstress. A particularly interesting example of this occurred last week with the latest\nauction conducted under the auspices of the Federal Reserve’s new Term Auction\nFacility (TAF).\nThe results of the latest TAF auction are shown on Figure 1. Allow me to provide\na bit of background.\nThe TAF is an alternative to a Discount Window loan. Both result in a loan from\nthe Federal Reserve to a financial institution, collateralized by assets that the borrowing\ninstitution has pledged to the Federal Reserve. However, with the addition of the TAF,\nfinancial institutions have two ways to borrow from the Discount Window. They can\nborrow using a traditional Discount Window loan, which is a loan at the primary credit\nrate – traditionally overnight but now up to 90 days term. 2 Currently the primary credit\nrate is 25 basis points over the Federal Funds rate, or a rate of 2.5 percent. Alternatively,\nthey can borrow for 28 days by participating in the Term Auction Facility, where the\nbidder is free to bid for funds at any rate above the minimum required for the auction\n(2.11 percent in the latest auction), and all those bids that are above the stop-out rate get\nthe stop-out rate for the loan.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs can be seen in the graph, last week the stop-out rate was 2.82 percent,\nsignificantly higher than the primary credit rate of 2.5 percent. Such a bid could be\nexplained if market participants believed it was likely that market rates would rise over\nthe 28 day term, but evidence from trading in Federal Funds futures and in overnight\nindex swaps indicate the opposite – that market participants believe it is far more likely\nthat the Federal Funds rate will fall from its current target. Similarly, the TAF stop-out\nrate exceeds the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the rate at which\nbanks can borrow one month unsecured money in London.\nSo how can this seeming anomaly be explained?\nFirst, the Federal Reserve does not trade for profits in the markets, so the firms\ncan bid in the auctions without fearing that their bids imply any immediate signaling of\npotential balance-sheet constraints or liquidity problems to the counterparty, the Federal\nReserve. As a result, firms may be willing to pay a premium for transacting with the\nFederal Reserve in order to avoid any immediate public signaling, and to avoid taking\nactions that could potentially be construed as signaling the existence of problems.\nSecond, firms may want to be sure that they have some term funding, and by\nplacing bids well above the primary credit rate they are in effect offering the equivalent\nof a non-competitive bid in a Treasury auction. They are willing to purchase the use of\nthe term funds at whatever the current market clearing price is in the auction, even if\nthere are less-costly options at the Discount Window or with private parties.\nThird, the winners of TAF auctions are not disclosed by the Federal Reserve. Of\ncourse, neither are institutions that take out Discount Window loans disclosed by name.\nHowever, market participants may believe that the auction process, where a variety of\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nbanks are jointly acquiring funds, may be interpreted differently than an individual\ninstitution borrowing from the Discount Window. 3\n\nSignaling and Short-Term Debt\nThe fact that banks are still choosing more costly financing options to avoid any\npotential signal of liquidity or balance-sheet constraints is very noteworthy – in that the\nfinancial turmoil that began in July of 2007 continues, even nine months after the onset of\nproblems.\nFigure 2 shows short-term interest-rate spreads. As you can see, Libor had\ntracked closely with the Federal Funds rate target in the first half of 2007, but has been\nelevated since the onset of financial problems in late July 2007. This has occurred\ndespite an overnight index swap rate that has been below the Federal Funds target since\nJuly, indicating a market perception that rates were likely to fall below the Federal Funds\ntarget. Since firms in such an environment should be able to borrow Federal Funds at the\nlow rate, and lend funds at the elevated Libor rate, the puzzle is why these rates have\nbecome, you might say, “unhinged.”\nThe volume of term lending transactions has declined significantly, with few\nbuyers or sellers of term funds. I can suggest several reasons.\nFirst, many potential suppliers of funds have become increasingly concerned\nabout their capital position, causing them to look for opportunities to shrink (or slow the\ngrowth of) assets on their balance sheets, in order to maintain a desirable capital-to-assets\nratio. Since unsecured inter-bank lending provides relatively low returns and has little\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nbenefit in terms of relationships, banks may prefer to use their balance sheet to fund\nhigher-returning assets that advance long-term customer relationships.\nSecond, as the uncertainty over asset valuations has increased, banks have\nbecome reluctant to take on significant counterparty risk to financial institutions –\nparticularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\nThird, many potential borrowers are reluctant to buy term funds at much higher\nrates than can be obtained overnight, for fear that they may signal to competitors that they\nhave liquidity concerns. However, when the counterparty is a central bank, financial\ninstitutions have been quite willing to buy term funding, sometimes at rates higher than\nthey would expect if they were to borrow funds overnight.\nThe various liquidity facilities being made available by central banks have helped\nimprove liquidity, and borrowers are more willing to purchase term lending. However,\nthe gyrations in the spread between Libor and the overnight index swap rate shown in\nFigure 3 demonstrate that we continue to have episodes where the spreads become large\nby historical standards. In addition, at times market participants have complained that\nfew if any transactions occur at term Libor rates when uncertainty in the market\nincreases. 4\nWhile actions taken by central banks are improving the supply of term financing,\neventually the confidence in private counterparties to comfortably buy or sell term funds\nneeds to be restored. A key ingredient in this outcome is that counterparties are truly\nwell capitalized and have a financing structure that does not make them susceptible to\ncounterparty runs. Increased capital not only reduces solvency risk, but also reduces the\nneed for liabilities that might flee during periods of financial difficulty. 5\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nUnlike the credit crunch in the early 1990s in the United States, many financial\nfirms have raised significant capital. Unfortunately, while in many cases these equity\nissues have offset recent losses, they may leave little additional buffer should further\ncredit losses occur. A number of large financial institutions have reduced their dividends,\nand given the potential for additional capital shortages it goes without saying that\nfinancial institutions should continue to assess whether further reductions or cessation of\ndividends would be advisable.\nIncreases in capital not only reduce solvency risk but also have salutary\nmacroeconomic implications. Financial institutions that choose not to raise capital\nthrough new equity issues or reductions in dividends are likely to react to capital losses\nby shrinking their balance sheets. Where and how they choose to reduce credit can have\nmacroeconomic implications, as the availability of credit can become a factor for some\nsubsets of borrowers.\nWhile the most obvious loss of credit availability has been the unwillingness of\nmany lenders to continue to lend for subprime mortgages 6 , other areas of the economy\nmay also be impacted as lenders seek to shrink their balance sheets and lower their\nexposure to areas that may be adversely impacted by the current financial turmoil and a\nslowing economy.\nSo far the main effect of the financial turmoil has been concentrated in large\nfinancial institutions that may be able to attract additional investors (see Figure 4). These\ntypes of institutions tended to hold the complicated financial instruments that have been\nmost affected by the financial turmoil. They have also seen their assets grow as they\nhave needed to move some off-balance-sheet assets onto their balance sheet, had lines of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncredit and liquidity options drawn down, and have been unable to distribute loans that\nthey had originated and expected to resell.\nSmaller banks have generally not held these complicated financial instruments, so\nthey have been more insulated from the financial turmoil. 7 They also have not been\nliquidity providers for securities, so they have experienced less unexpected growth in\ntheir assets. As a result, there have been far fewer complaints from small and medium\nsized businesses – generally the clients of smaller banks – about credit availability.\nHowever, it is important to note that the continued health of small and medium\nsized banks will be impacted should residential and commercial real estate prices decline\nin a severe manner. While that is not my forecast, it is only fair to note that for the\nliquidity problems to be confined it is important for collateral values to stabilize.\nSignificant price declines will likely lead to more residential and perhaps commercial\nmortgage defaults not necessarily limited to the subprime market, and thus more likely\nlinked to mortgages held in portfolio by smaller banks. 8\n\nConclusion\nThe extended period of illiquidity – in markets that, a year ago, would have been\ndescribed by most as highly liquid and relatively low risk – highlights the importance of\nunderstanding liquidity risk, and understanding which asset-pricing and accounting\nassumptions rely on liquid markets. The ability to value complex financial instruments\nand the use of market-value accounting for financial statements are integrally tied to\nassumptions of liquid markets. In markets where few if any transactions occur, valuation\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndifficulties can severely hamper the ability of key market participants to evaluate their\ncounterparty risk and hence the functioning of markets.\nI believe this period of illiquid markets should also cause central banks to reevaluate their roles. For a central bank to play an effective role during financial turmoil,\nit needs to understand the sources of liquidity problems, the interrelationships between\nmarket participants, likely losses, and market participants’ potential reactions to these\nlosses 9 .\nIn my view, this can only be done if the central bank has some form of hands-on\nsupervisory experience with institutions – particularly the “systemically important”\ninstitutions – regardless of who is the primary regulator. The Federal Reserve has been\nfar more effective during this crisis because it has hands-on experience with bank holding\ncompanies that are among the most significant players in many financial markets.\nIn short, there are significant synergies between bank supervision and monetary\npolicy during periods of financial turmoil – synergies that can be used to achieve better\noutcomes for the public as policy makers try to determine the impact of liquidity\nproblems and how changes in credit will impact the broader economy 10 .\nHaving some form of similarly hands-on supervisory experience with any\nsystemically important financial institution that may need to access the Discount Window\nis, in the long term, critically important. We need to understand the solvency and\nliquidity positions of firms that may access the Discount Window – with access, at the\nvery least, to the information any counterparty would require in a lending relationship.\nFor those financial institutions that do have access to the Discount Window, there is\nindeed a need for the Fed to have broader access to information than marketplace\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncounterparty creditors, if we are to effectively manage our responsibilities as lender of\nlast resort and custodian of financial stability. So, regardless of who is the primary\nregulator, it is important for the Fed to understand the consolidated capital and liquidity\npositions of such firms.\nIn sum, I believe that as we consider these and other lessons learned from the\ncurrent turmoil, we can take appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood that extended\nperiods of illiquidity will occur in the future.\n\nNotes:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nDiscount Window loans are generally described as overnight loans, and had traditionally\nbeen. Due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve in response to market events, however,\ndepository institutions can take Discount Window loans out for any term between overnight and\nup to 90 days. In August 2007 the Federal Reserve Board announced a change to allow the\nprovision of term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. Then in March\n2008 the Board approved an increase in the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 90\ndays.\nSo, in essence a 28-day term Discount Window loan could be secured by a depository\ninstitution – a loan that would be similar to using the TAF’s structure, but at lower rate.\nAlso, it is worth highlighting that another structural difference between the TAF and the\nDiscount Window is that a Discount Window loan can be prepaid at the option of the depository\ninstitution while the TAF cannot. This suggests that an institution with all other factors being\nequal, and absent consideration of any “stigma” or signaling issues, might use the Discount\nWindow over the TAF.\n3\n\nBy some accounts the reporting of Discount Window borrowing by Federal Reserve\nDistrict is particularly concerning to a firm in a District which has few large participants –\nbecause any large borrowings from within such a District are likely to be done by only a limited\npool of institutions, making market speculation more finely focused.\n\n4\n\nRecently, the financial press has reported on market speculation that Libor fixings are\nbeing under-reported. For example, the Wall Street Journal on April 17 noted that “Bankers and\ntraders have expressed concerns that some banks don’t want to report the high rates they are\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\npaying for fear of creating the impression they are desperate for cash.” [“British Bankers Group\nSteps Up Review of Widely Used Libor” by Carrick Mollenkamp and Laurence Norman].\n5\n\nRaising and retaining capital is one way to reduce this risk. Other steps could include\nimproving transparency and disclosure practices – particularly around underlying assets, offbalance-sheet risks, and valuation techniques.\n\n6\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates\nreflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime\nloans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans,\nalthough a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\n\n7\n\nParenthetically, the TAF's minimum bid size was reduced to $5 million in February to\nfacilitate the participation of smaller institutions.

For a copy of the\nspeech please refer to http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/032708.htm\n\n10\n\nSeveral academic papers have found that supervisory information could be useful in\nforecasting inflation, unemployment, and bank dependent components of GDP. Please refer to\nthe following papers for more details:\nSee \"Is Bank Supervision Central to Central Banking?\" by Joe Peek, Eric Rosengren, and\nGeoffrey M. B. Tootell in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. vol. 114 (May 1999): pages 629653. The paper finds that confidential bank supervisory information could help more accurately\nforecast important macroeconomic variables and is useful to monetary policymaking. The\nfindings suggest that the complementarity between supervisory responsibilities and monetary\npolicy should he an important consideration when evaluating the structure of a central bank.\nAlso see \"Does the Federal Reserve Possess An Exploitable Informational Advantage?\"\nby Joe Peek, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey M.B. Tootell in the Journal of Monetary Economics,\nvol. 50, no. 4 (May 2003), pages 817-839, which found evidence that the Federal Reserve has an\ninformational advantage that can be used to improve monetary policy.\nAlso, in \"Identifying the Macroeconomic Effect of Loan Supply Shocks,\" by Joe Peek,\nEric Rosengren and Geoffrey M.B. Tootell in the Journal of Money Credit and Banking. vol. 35,\nno. l 6 part 1 (December 2003), pages 931-946, the authors found that confidential supervisory\ninformation was useful in predicting components of GDP that would likely be dependent on bank\nfinancing.\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 1\nShort-Term Interest Rates Before and After the\nFederal Reserve's April 7 Term Auction\nApril 3, 2008 - April 10, 2008\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\nTAF* Stop-Out Rate\n\n2.8\n\n2.8\n1-Month LIBOR\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\nDiscount Window Primary Credit Rate\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\nFederal FundsTarget Rate\n\n2.2\n\n2.2\n1-Month Overnight Index Swap Rate\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n03-Apr-2008\n\n04-Apr-2008\n\n07-Apr-2008\n\n08-Apr-2008\n\n09-Apr-2008\n\n10-Apr-2008\n\n*Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate, Overnight Index Swap Rate,\nFederal Funds Target Rate, and TAF* Stop-Out Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - April 15, 2008\n\nPercent\n6.0\n\nPercent\n6.0\n1-Month LIBOR\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\nFederal Funds\nTarget Rate\n\nTAF* Stop-Out Rate\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n1-Month OIS Rate\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n1-Jan\n\n1.0\n12-Feb 26-Mar\n\n7-May\n\n18-Jun\n\n30-Jul\n\n10-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n3-Dec\n\n14-Jan 25-Feb\n\n7-Apr\n\n*Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility -- First Auction December 17, 2007\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - April 15, 2008\n\nBasis Points\n\nBasis Points\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n1-Jan\n\n0\n12-Feb\n\n26-Mar\n\n7-May\n\n18-Jun\n\n30-Jul\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n10-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n3-Dec\n\n14-Jan\n\n25-Feb\n\n7-Apr\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4\nBalance-Sheet Growth at U.S. Commercial and\nSavings Banks by Asset Size\n2006:Q4 – 2007:Q4\nIndex, 2006:Q4 = 100\n120\n\nIndex, 2006:Q4 = 100\n120\n\n115\n\n115\nLoans at Large Banks\n110\n\nAssets at Large Banks\nLoans at Small Banks\n\n105\n\n105\n\nAssets at Small Banks\n\n100\n\n110\n\n100\n\n95\n\n95\n2006:Q4\n\n2007:Q1\n\n2007:Q2\n\n2007:Q3\n\n2007:Q4\n\nNote: Large Banks are banks with asset of $50 billion or more.\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n5\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nConference on New Challenges for Operational Risk Measurement\nand Management\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 14, 2008\n\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to this conference on operational risk, and to offer\nmy thoughts on the lessons for risk-management that we can glean from recent financial\nturmoil. 1 I would like to thank all of you for attending, and the speakers and organizers\nfor their efforts. Like all of you, I am looking forward to the conference and the\nopportunity to, together, take a fresh look at risk management and risk modeling in light\nof recent events.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe practices of risk management in general, and operational risk in particular,\nhave made great strides in the past several years – progress that has been stimulated, in\npart, by the Basel II process. In the past several years risk management information\nsystems have improved significantly, the collection of data related to risk has become\nmore comprehensive, and the analysis of risk and the determination of appropriate capital\nhas become more sophisticated. In addition, within institutions senior management and\nboards of directors have become more attuned to their responsibilities in understanding\nthe risks facing their organizations, and ensuring they have appropriate capital.\nDespite these significant and important gains, there are clearly lessons to learn\nfrom the performance of contemporary risk management practices during the period of\nfinancial turmoil that began in late July.\nAs is shown in Figure 1 – which shows the spread between the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate – the reluctance of\nbanks to lend to each other has been quite elevated since July 2007. A combination of\nbalance sheet constraints 2 , poor transparency regarding potential losses 3 , and heightened\ncounterparty-risk concerns has contributed to less liquid financial markets and\nhighlighted the fact that, in retrospect, even improved scenario analysis and stress tests\ndid not fully capture the potential for events like those that have occurred over the past\nnine months.\nAs the chart showing the LIBOR/OIS spread indicates, there have been ebbs and\nflows in the recent turmoil. I would suggest that the path of the chart’s line reflects the\nthree phases of recent turmoil – beginning with a focus on liquidity risk, moving to\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nincreased concern over credit risk, and now seemingly evolving into concern over\neconomic risks.\nIndeed, initially the widening spread seemed to indicate serious liquidity\nproblems. Problems in the subprime 4 mortgage market and with securitization and\nstructured products – which came to light in the summer of 2007 – resulted in illiquidity\nfor a variety of financial instruments that market participants had assumed had relatively\nlow risk and were highly liquid.\nAs the financial turmoil continued, the primary concern moved from illiquid\nfinancial instruments to concerns about credit risk and likely asset write-downs. Starting\nat the end of 2007 and continuing through the first quarter of 2008, a variety of financial\ninstitutions announced very significant write-downs, and many also announced that they\nneeded to raise additional capital.\nAs we move to a third phase, the focus has shifted to concerns about the economic\nrisks – the risks generated by an economy that has slowed noticeably. While much of\nthe turmoil in financial markets occurred during relatively benign macroeconomic\nconditions, the economic situation has changed. We have seen job losses, unexpected\nand persistent increases in food and energy prices, and falling asset prices – all increasing\nthe risk that less benign economic circumstances will add to the already intense\nchallenges faced by financial institutions this year.\nWith that context it is useful and important to consider the lessons we can learn\nregarding risk management and risk modeling in light of recent events. Today I am going\nto discuss three areas that are important for risk management generally, but also have\nclear applications to operational risk.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n The first area for discussion involves the role of liquidity – and the assumption that\nalways-liquid markets will enable the disposal of assets relatively easily. During\nfinancial turmoil, assets trade less frequently as asset-values dip to liquidation levels\nand dealers and financial intermediaries become less willing to commit their balance\nsheets. While liquidity issues are particularly relevant for credit and market risk, they\nalso have implications for operational risk. For example, consider rogue trading,\nwhereby an institution finds itself with a large unintended position. If such a situation\nbecomes public the institution may face liquidity issues as other market participants,\ntaking advantage of the institution’s need to liquidate or reduce the position, demand\nsteep discounts. So even the announcement of a rogue trader has important\nimplications for the severity of losses that are incurred in such situations.\n\n The second area for discussion involves the challenge of estimating risk models when\nthe historical data are limited. For example, difficulties in accurately estimating\nexpected defaults on subprime mortgages without the benefit of default data from\ndownturn periods 5 , in retrospect, resulted in a significant underestimate of potential\nlosses (a dynamic that was compounded by competitive pressures that led to loosening\nof underwriting standards). This problem is significant in the area of operational risk,\nwhere most firms do not have comprehensive data that extends back even a decade.\nThe reality of such short time series should keep us relatively humble about our ability\nto estimate unlikely events, and lead us to be conservative in our parameter estimates\nand the estimates of capital needed against those risks. Correspondingly, when we\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nhave longer time series, we should be leery of picking and choosing apparently\nrelevant, but smaller, samples – which may lead to underestimates of risk.\n\n The third area for discussion involves the role of scenarios and stress tests in\nevaluating risk. Many financial firms that I talked with when I was leading bank\nsupervision at the Boston Fed conducted stress tests that assumed 10 and 20 percent\ndeclines in national housing prices. Risk managers were well aware of the run-up in\nhousing prices and concerned that they might reverse. When they conducted these\nstress tests, every firm I talked to had concluded that such an event would impact\nearnings, not capital. I noted at the time that I found that curious – since, in my own\nexperience studying economic situations, falling housing prices had not had such\nbenign results. In retrospect, those stress tests were often taking place at firms that\nhave since needed to raise capital because those estimates were so wrong. Given that\nmany firms are now more reliant on scenarios and stress tests for estimating\noperational risk, recent experience should provide a cautionary tale and dispel any\nreluctance or complacency in working to improve these very important practices.\n\nI will cover each of these areas in a bit more detail in a moment. First, however, I\nwant to note that despite a number of lessons from the recent financial turmoil, we should\nnot despair, nor should we see investments in risk management as wasted. Indeed, had\nthe discipline not advanced as far as it has, I believe the recent financial turmoil would be\nmuch more damaging.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAnd as a result of our models and improved risk management, with some nudges\nfrom bank supervisors, banks capital position in aggregate remain quite healthy (See\nFigure 2). The ability and willingness of many financial firms to raise additional capital,\ndespite the financial turmoil, highlights the fact that outside investors have confidence in\nthe long-run strength of these financial institutions and their ability to appropriately\nmanage risk going forward. Already I am hearing about improvements in risk\nmanagement stemming from the current problems, and by building on these lessons we\ncan be better prepared for future problems.\n\nI. The Role of Liquidity\nUnderlying many risk models was the assumption of highly liquid markets. In a\nvariety of markets, assets that were viewed as relatively safe and liquid in July 2007 are\nnow thinly traded – and, when they do trade, do so at surprisingly deep discounts. In\nparticular, there have been very steep discounts for triple-A tranches of asset-backed\nsecurities. Not only have prices dropped as investors have become less certain of the\nlikely default experience of these highly rated securities, but they also include a\nsignificant liquidity premium as investors are avoiding assets that are now viewed as\ndifficult to value. These discounts seem particularly large given the plausible estimates\nof potential losses for these assets – in particular if the economy improves in the second\nhalf of this year, as many private forecasters anticipate. 6\nRecent experience highlights that effective credit risk management requires robust\nevaluation of exposure to possible liquidity strains during times of stress. Experience\nalso highlights the issues that come with being overly reliant on credit ratings as a\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nsurrogate for rigorous credit evaluation. Firms that have significant investments in\nstructured securities may need to consider whether their so-called “Pillar II” capital 7\nallocation is adequate to capture some of the liquidity and model risk that has recently\nshown its importance.\nHowever, traditional credit evaluation is not the only place where liquidity\nassumptions were imbedded, and somewhat problematic. Many firms held funds that\nthey needed for short-term liquidity in auction- rate securities 8 and in funds that invested\nin structured products. (See Figure 3) As these complex instruments have become less\nliquid, many firms have been caught in a cash squeeze.\n\nEven some sophisticated hedge-\n\nfund investors were often too comfortable keeping short-term, liquid funds in complex\ninstruments that encountered difficulties once the financial market turmoil emerged,\nleading to strains on liquidity. Many of these investors have re-evaluated their holdings,\npreferring to reduce risk (and return) in funds held for short-term liquidity purposes, and\nto focus their risk-taking within longer-term portfolios.\nLiquidity can also be a problem in operational risk management. Backroom\nproblems can occur during periods of stress. Particularly as firms have become more\ndependent on using credit-default swaps and tailored derivatives to hedge risk, the cost of\nimperfectly placed hedges (for example a hedge that was faulty due to model error) and\nprocessing problems that can occur during stressful times can generate outsized risks.\nThe most recent example of liquidity impacting the severity of operational losses\nis the illiquidity created by the need to quickly unwind positions generated by rogue\ntraders. Having large unwanted positions that have declined in value can create\nsignificant problems for the institution. Such a firm has few appealing options, in that\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwidespread knowledge of the loss can make it quite costly to unwind the position – but at\nthe same time, failure to quickly reveal the loss can create legal entanglements as\ninterested parties seek legal remedies for the concealment of material information. Many\nof the large rogue-trading losses occurred during periods when trading positions have\ndeclined, and where illiquidity made the unwinding of positions potentially costly.\n\nII. Estimating Risk Models with Limited Data\nEvaluating the risk of new products, or products undergoing significant change, is\na particular challenge for risk managers. The subprime mortgage market is a good case\nin point, as subprime mortgages have undergone significant changes over the past five\nyears. Traditionally, mortgage loans to “less-than-prime” borrowers had occurred\nthrough government programs such as FHA, or in an environment where prime loans\nwere experiencing difficulties. But over the past five years there was a significant\nchange. The advent of securitization and the ability to originate to distribute had a\ndramatic impact on this market. (See Figure 4)\nThe growth in this market benefited from the history of low default rates on home\nmortgages in general. It was often noted that home prices had not fallen nationally since\nthe 1930s, that real estate cycles had not been correlated in different regions of the\ncountry, and that homeowners would go to great lengths to avoid foreclosure on the “roof\nover their heads.”\nHowever, the originate-to-distribute model for subprime lending changed many\naspects of these underlying assumptions. The ability of borrowers to purchase homes\nwith little or no capital greatly expanded the pool of potential borrowers – which, coupled\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwith rising prices, resulted in positive homeownership experiences for so-called\n“subprime borrowers” in the first half of this decade.\nAs regional real estate markets have become more integrated and their prices\nmore correlated, home price declines have been national not just regional. While there\nare certainly some important regional differences, all ten of the metropolitan areas\ntracked in the Case-Shiller index have seen a fall in home prices (See Figure 5).\nThe generally-accepted approaches to modeling subprime mortgage default\nprobabilities frequently did not capture how the economics of subprime lending had\nchanged. For example, models estimated only on the experience of the first half of this\ndecade – the period for which data on securitized, originate-to-distribute, subprime loans\nwere available – did not include significant downturns, did not have falling home prices,\nand did not have the increased correlation of regional home prices. The result is that both\nthe ratings and the capital needed to hold mortgage securities underestimated the risk.\nOf course, the challenges of new products and short historical time series are quite\nfamiliar to operational risk practitioners. 9 Operational risk modeling has been plagued by\nthe short period of time that most institutions have collected comprehensive internal data.\nHowever, even in this short period of data collection, it is striking how many billiondollar operational loss experiences have occurred.\nThe bulk of these billion-dollar losses reflect rogue trading and large legal\nsettlements. Many institutions have viewed losses of this magnitude as “once in a\nthousand years” events, or not applicable to their own modeling – for example because of\ntheir institution’s size relative to that of institutions experiencing those magnitude events\n(a logic that causes some risk managers at smaller institutions to truncate the potential for\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nlosses, perhaps incorrectly). As we get more data, however, it is becoming clear that\nsuch losses at financial institutions are more common than was initially thought. Clearly,\ndiscounting or artificially constraining such losses can risk leaving institutions with\ninadequate capital relative to their risks.\nThe example of subprime mortgages has relevance for operational risk as well as\ncredit risk. The originate-to-distribute model resulted in the loan originator frequently\nhaving little interest in sufficiently screening borrowers. In fact, the desire to maintain\nvolumes appears to have caused some originators to engage in fraudulent actions to\nqualify borrowers. In addition, lawsuits related to subprime loans have emerged, with\nconcerns raised on fraudulent transactions, inadequate disclosure of emerging problems\nto investors, and selling inappropriate products to borrowers. While the likely success of\nthese lawsuits is uncertain, the relevant lesson for risk management involves fully\nconsidering all the potential operational risks with new products, or with new delivery\nmechanisms for existing products.\nOf note are the decisions that some financial institutions made in regard to\nsubprime mortgages. Many large institutions chose not to participate in the subprime\nmarket. In talking with some of these institutions about such decisions, concerns\nregarding reputational risk and potential lawsuits – rather than credit concerns – seem to\nhave played an important role. Other institutions chose to participate, but limited the\nproducts they offered, limited the originators with whom they would do business, or\nimplemented other risk controls to limit exposure to inappropriately underwritten loans.\nIn many respects, these decisions reflect a heightened awareness by senior management\nand Board of Directors regarding operational risks.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIt is noteworthy that some of the most poorly underwritten loans that resulted in\nearly payment defaults were frequently made by financial institutions with little or no\nregulatory oversight. For those institutions whose risk management approach did not\nsufficiently consider the operational risks related to these products, the lessons have\nalready been costly, and potentially large legal risks remain from those decisions.\nThis difference in bank behavior towards subprime mortgages is noteworthy.\nWhile it is difficult to prove, firms that were better versed in operational risk may have\nbeen more careful in considering all the risks inherent in entering this market. Because\nsubprime loans grew rapidly and were quite profitable for a number of years, it took\nsignificant discipline to decide to forego some aspects of the business.\n\nIII. The Role of Scenarios and Stress Tests in Evaluating Risk\nParticularly given the limited data, many banks have significantly increased their\nuse of scenarios analysis and stress tests. While this is a very important and promising\ndevelopment, we must recognize that we are at the early stages of using these tools.\nMany institutions did conduct stress tests of what would happen if housing prices fell.\nMost of these stress tests noted the institution’s limited amount of direct exposure to\nresidential mortgages and construction loans. Others noted that while they held\nmortgage-backed securities, they only held the triple-A tranches of these securitizations.\nMuch of the modeling was a somewhat more sophisticated migration analysis of\ndirect exposures. However, none of the major stress tests I am aware of – done by a\nvariety of financial institutions – came close to capturing the depth of the problems that\nwe are experiencing today.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nWhat was missing was economic and financial analysis that would result in an\naccurate stress scenario:\n\n While the scenarios did capture direct exposures, many did not incorporate the critical\nlink between falling housing prices and the greater incentive they would provide for\nborrowers with little capital invested to stop payments if they experienced an income\nor employment shock.\n There was also insufficient modeling of how securitization would be impacted by\nproblems with subprime securitizations.\n The analyses also overlooked the likelihood that a household that was unable to repay\nits mortgage might also have difficulty repaying its other debts.\n Finally, the effect of mortgage defaults on the ability of many institutions to obtain\nshort-term funding – the liquidity effects I discussed earlier – was often missed.\n\nWith so many such linkages missed, and with undue confidence that the scenario was\nquite unlikely because national housing prices had not declined significantly in the postwar period, some managers took too much comfort.\nOperational risk management has increasingly used scenarios to understand how\nlarge losses can occur at a firm. However, as in the subprime example, scenarios that are\nto accurately reflect risk require a willingness to think expansively about linkages, and\ncannot be artificially constrained by a desire to minimize capital.\nIdeally, scenarios that suggest a need for greater capital should guide the firm in\nconsidering whether it needs new controls, or whether it is able in some other way to\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nreduce the “tail risk” (low probability but high impact) associated with an activity.\nHowever, the scenarios used by firms are often capped or truncated in order to avoid\nincurring a large capital charge, or are assumed to have already been sufficiently\nmitigated even though they have occurred, sometimes frequently, at competing firms.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge arises in capturing legal risk. Most of the largest\noperational losses have been legal losses (See Figure 6). Frequently a firm is quite\ncareful about discussing pending litigation for fear that it might provide information to\nthe litigant. In addition, the probability of litigation and the possible severity should a\ncase be lost or settled remain a “blind spot” in risk analysis.\nI am hopeful that in the coming years firms will be able to improve models of\npotential litigation losses. With the experience of accounting and market-timing scandals\nearlier in the decade, and the litigation likely to stem from the subprime mortgage crisis,\nfirms should have a wealth of data to see if past scenarios captured this risk, whether that\nrisk was elevated to appropriate levels, and whether sufficient actions were taken.\nEven with improvements in scenario analysis there will be significant judgement\ninvolved in the exercise. As behavioral economics has highlighted, it can be very\ndifficult to elicit accurate qualitative information from managers. Generating scenario\ndata that is predictive (that is, forward looking) requires calculated rigor. Thus it seems\nprudent to approach such analysis with a degree of humility. We should recognize the\nlimits to our ability to capture the many interactions among actors and assets in our\nformal approaches, and thus introduce a sufficient degree of conservatism in estimating\nthe potential losses highlighted in the scenarios.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nConclusion\nThe recent financial turmoil has highlighted both the benefits and the challenges\nassociated with pursuing risk management. Clearly, firms that minimized capital\nestimates and did little analysis surrounding the credit, market, and operational risk\nassociated with subprime securitizations have suffered.\nIt is not in the long-run interest of a bank to underestimate the capital associated\nwith significant activities. Such an underestimation results in an over-willingness to\ncontinue to expand in risky areas and – should those risks come to fruition – risks the\nfirm needing additional capital, being acquired, or in the extreme failing.\nEarlier in this decade I asked a risk manager whose firm had just experienced a\nvery significant operational loss how that had influenced the firm’s risk management and\nrisk modeling. The answer I received was that it was a one in a thousand year event; so\nwhile they had instituted some additional controls, it did little to change their need to\nallocate capital for that activity. The next year they had an even larger operational loss in\na related area. While it is certainly possible to have two unlikely events in successive\nyears, the probability is relatively remote. Organizations that too willingly ignore the\nunfortunate events that they or their competitors have experienced only increase the\nprobability that such mistakes will be repeated.\nWhile there have been great strides in risk management practices, risk managers\nneed to be continually pushing their firms to think creatively and expansively about\npotential risks. The lessons from the recent financial turmoil have probably provided\nmore examples than we would have liked. Nonetheless, I am confident that continued,\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndiligent improvement in risk management and risk modeling will make financial\ninstitutions and financial markets even safer and more resilient in the future.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nDuring the recent financial turmoil in the United States bank assets have actually grown,\nparticularly at the largest institutions. Banks have reduced their holdings of government securities,\nbut have expanded their holdings of other securities and commercial and industrial loans. Much of\nthis growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in response to\nliquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the factors that\nhave increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial paper, firms\nexpanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were originated with\nthe expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing the purchase of\nmunicipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being securitized. Such\nfactors can significantly swell bank assets, placing pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull\nback in other areas.\n\n3\n\nI discussed transparency and disclosure in a March speech available on the Boston Fed’s\nweb site (www.bos.frb.org) at the following address:\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/030608.htm.\n4\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates\nreflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime\nloans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans,\nalthough a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the\ncredit characteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit\nhistories that include payment delinquencies and possibly more severe problems such as chargeoffs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured\nby credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with\nincomplete credit histories. Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these\ncharacteristics at the time of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than\nloans to prime borrowers. Generally, subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk\ncharacteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two or more 30-day delinquencies\nin the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24 months; Judgment,\nforeclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5 years;\nRelatively high default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO)\nof 660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an\nequivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or\ngreater, or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly\ndebt-service requirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nis not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition\nmay not match all market or institution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a\nstarting point from which the Agencies will expand examination efforts.”\n5\n\nThat is, periods characterized by economic or asset-price downturns.\n\n6\n\nThe recent declines in the highest-graded of some mortgage securities implies very\nsignificant losses, as investors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lowergraded securities had been wiped out.\n\n7\n\n“The Basel Framework is divided into three pillars, the second and third of which are new\ncompared to Basel I. Pillar 1: the minimum capital requirements, which include capital\nrequirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk ... Pillar 1 lays down a flexible\nframework within which a bank, subject to a supervisory approval, may apply an approach that best\nsuits its complexity and risk profile ... Pillar 2: supervisory review process (SRP), which adds a\nqualitative element to the quantitative minimum capital requirements of Pillar 1; the SRP mainly\naims at identifying the overall risk of an institution and the main influential factors on its risk\nsituation and to evaluate them from a supervisory perspective. Pillar 3: market discipline, i.e.,\nthe institutions are to be subject to enhanced disclosure requirements in order to make use of the\ndisciplining forces of the markets as a complement to the regulatory requirements.” Source: Basel\nII - the new Capital Accord, from the Deutsche Bundesbank's website (at\nhttp://www.bundesbank.de/bankenaufsicht/bankenaufsicht_basel.en.php)\n8\n\n”Auction-rate securities (ARS) are long-term variable-rate instruments with their interest\nrates reset at periodic and frequent auctions. They are often marketed to issuers as an alternative\nvariable-rate financing vehicle and to investors as an alternative to money market funds. Investors\nhave historically been able to liquidate ARS positions at face value at frequent auctions, leading\nmany to consider them cash-like. After hundreds of auction failures in February 2008, however,\nthe Wall Street Journal declared that the ARS market had ‘virtually collapsed.’” Source: Stephanie\nLee, NERA Economic Consulting, Auction-Rate Securities: Bidder’s Remorse? A Primer. May 6,\n2008\n\n9\n\nMy colleagues in the Bank’s Supervision, Regulation, and Credit area note that such issues\nhave occurred throughout the history of financial innovation; this is not an isolated event. A good\nillustration of this point is the introduction of portfolio insurance in the mid 1980s. Portfolio\ninsurance was a strategy that worked very well for some time, as long as markets were liquid. The\nassumption was that there would always be buyers at a price – and the pricing was done under the\nassumption that the various structural and statistical relationships would remain intact.\nUnfortunately, the strategy failed when it was needed the most, in October 1987. As soon\nas the stock market started crashing a large number of dynamic hedges were initiated to cover the\ninsured portfolios. The number of insurance contracts was so large that it aggravated the market\ndecline and triggered further hedges. The existence of portfolio insurance changed the dynamics of\nthe market and could not have been captured by data collected prior to the introduction of this new\ninstrument.\nAnother similarity between the portfolio insurance and securitization is the fact that\ninvestors ignored the change in behavior due to the introduction of the instrument: portfolio\ninsurance gave a false sense of security to fund managers pushing them to adopt riskier strategies,\nthe same way as securitization introduced moral hazard in the mortgage business.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 1\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - May 9, 2008\n\nBasis Points\n\nBasis Points\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n1-Jan\n\n19-Feb\n\n9-Apr\n\n28-May\n\n16-Jul\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics\n\n3-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n10-Dec\n\n28-Jan\n\n17-Mar\n\n0\n5-May\n\n\fFigure 2\nEquity Capital to Assets Ratio at U.S. Commercial\nand Savings Banks by Asset Size\n1985:Q1 – 2007:Q4\nPercent\n12\n\nPercent\n12\n10\n\n10\nSmall Banks\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\nLarge Banks\n\nNote: Large banks are banks with assets of $50 billion or more.\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports\n\n07:Q1\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q1\n\n04:Q1\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q1\n\n01:Q1\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q1\n\n98:Q1\n\n97:Q1\n\n96:Q1\n\n95:Q1\n\n94:Q1\n\n93:Q1\n\n92:Q1\n\n91:Q1\n\n90:Q1\n\n0\n89:Q1\n\n0\n88:Q1\n\n2\n\n87:Q1\n\n2\n\n86:Q1\n\n4\n\n85:Q1\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 3\nThe Auction-Rate Securities Market:\nAuction Failure Rates in February 2008\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\nData Not Available\n\n80\n\n40\n20\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n2/7/2008\n\n2/11/2008\n\n2/13/2008\n\n2/15/2008\n\n2/19/2008\n\n2/21/2008\n\n2/25/2008\n\n2/27/2008\n\nSource: Lee, Stephanie, \"Auction-Rate Securities: Bidder's Remorse?

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe New England Economic Partnership’s\nSpring Economic Outlook Conference\non Credit, Housing, and the Consequences for New England\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 30, 2008\n\nAs someone who is an ardent consumer of good economic analysis, I have often\nbeen the beneficiary of work done by the New England Economic Partnership. So it is\ncertainly a pleasure to be with you today to participate in your discussion of current\ntrends in the economy, and credit and housing matters. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nOver the past year, the economy has been buffeted by a series of shocks including\nfinancial turmoil; an emergency acquisition of a major investment bank to avoid a\nsudden, disorderly failure 2 ; falling national housing prices; and oil prices that have\nexceeded $130 a barrel. Despite all these challenges, the U.S. unemployment rate is at 5\npercent; the rise in prices of “core” consumer goods and services (Personal Consumption\nExpenditures) to a little above 2 percent, while unwelcome, has not been large compared\nwith past episodes; and the economy has been growing, albeit at a much slower pace then\nwe would prefer. These relatively benign outcomes to date are at least partly the result of\nrecent monetary and fiscal policy actions taken to mitigate some of the problems facing\nthe economy.\nIn keeping with the title of your conference – “Crunched: Credit, Housing and the\nConsequences for New England” – I am going to focus on the continued downside risk\nposed by falling asset prices, particularly in the housing sector. Residential investment\n(the housing component of GDP 3 ) has declined for nine straight quarters, and in all\nlikelihood will decline this quarter as well. This has been an unusually long period of\ncontinuous decline in the housing sector, and coupled with falling housing prices\nnationally, has complicated predictions of what will happen in the economy going\nforward.\nI would like to begin by first looking at some of the macroeconomic issues related\nto the housing sector, and considering why – despite being a relatively small component\nof GDP – housing continues to be a source of such significant uncertainty in the\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThen secondly, I will discuss some of the varied and interesting research done\nrecently at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston by economists and analysts (including\nPrabal Chakrabarti, Chris Foote, Kristopher Gerardi, Lorenz Goette, Kai-Yan Lee, Adam\nShapiro, and Paul Willen). This work highlights some striking differences, and some\nsimilarities, between the current housing problems and those experienced in New\nEngland in the early 1990s. In particular I will note the observation that foreclosures\nremained elevated well after their peak in the last downturn, and the finding that multifamily properties are playing a much more important role in the current housing\ndownturn.\nThirdly, I am going to discuss why developing solutions to the current housing\nproblems has not been easy, and why the housing sector, despite being sensitive to\ninterest rates, remains very weak notwithstanding a significant amount of monetary\nstimulus in the form of Federal Funds rate reductions. In particular, I will highlight the\nimportant role of so-called “piggyback loans,” or second mortgages; the implications of\nhomeowners having “negative home equity” as a result of falling house prices; and the\ncomplications created by the securitization of many mortgages.\nFinally, I am going to briefly discuss some implications for policymakers in\nseeking to develop and implement responses to the problems posed by falling house\nprices and rising delinquencies and foreclosures.\n\nI.\n\nMacroeconomic Implications of Housing Trends\nFigure 1 highlights how precipitously single-family housing starts have declined\n\nsince their peak. This is actually the largest peak-to-trough decline in housing starts to\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\noccur in nearly 50 years. The decline is occurring in what would seem, in fact, to be a\nrelatively benign economic environment, with U.S. unemployment at 5 percent and\ninterest rates low by historical standards.\nHowever, the reduction in credit availability generated by recent, significant\ndisruptions in the securitization of mortgages has made it particularly difficult for\nborrowers seeking subprime 4 and “jumbo” loans. What was likely to be a weak\nresidential market has become a market characterized by major declines as builders seek\nto reduce their swelling housing inventories and as continuing price declines raise the\ncosts of holding on to land or unsold homes.\nThese problems have begun to have an impact on some financial institutions that\nhad taken outsized positions in construction loans, or whose business model was focused\non the types of residential lending most impacted by the downturn. Of course, the\ndramatic decline in housing starts should expedite the process of reducing the inventories\nof unsold homes, and over time provide a basis for stabilizing the housing market –\nalthough with sales continuing to decline, the most recent readings show little or no\nprogress in cutting inventories relative to sales.\nA potential problem for financial institutions is the interaction between falling\nhousing prices and homeowners’ home equity lines of credit (HELOCs 5 ) and junior\nliens 6 (home equity loans). As housing prices have risen over the course of this decade,\nproducts have proliferated that allow consumers to tap into the wealth created by homeprice appreciation. As can be seen in Figure 2, home equity loans and HELOCs have\nexpanded rapidly – together they now account for over $700 billion of bank assets (which\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\naccounts for about one-third of the $2.1 trillion in one-to-four-family mortgages held by\nthe nation's commercial and savings banks as of March 31, 2008).\nUsing home equity can be particularly attractive to consumers because of the tax\nadvantages of borrowing with the home as collateral, the lower interest rate on mortgage\nloans relative to other forms of consumer debt, and the ability to expand the credit line\nduring a period of rapid appreciation in home prices.\nDespite the advantages to consumers, these products are potentially risky to\nlenders during periods of falling home prices. Most financial institutions will not take\npossession of homes when borrowers default on their home-equity loans (junior liens),\nbecause this would require them to assume the first mortgage. With falling housing\nprices, assuming the first mortgage is not an attractive option from the lender’s\nperspective. An additional complication is that default will frequently not occur until the\nhome equity line of credit has been fully utilized, as borrowers who are having difficulty\nmaking payments can tap their credit line again and again. Thus, credit problems may\nfirst appear as rising balances rather than a failure to make payments.\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, the delinquency rates (specifically, the share of loans 90 or\nmore days past due or nonaccruing) on junior liens and home equity lines are rising quite\nrapidly. One should note that most banks were not lending to so-called subprime\nborrowers, but nonetheless, the delinquency rate on one-to-four family mortgages just\nsurpassed the levels seen in the early 1990s 7 .\nAs noted earlier, the rapid rise in delinquencies for home equity lines and junior\nliens held at banks is occurring despite an unemployment rate of about 5 percent – so,\nshould the unemployment rate rise and housing prices continue to fall, financial stresses\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncaused by the housing correction could well spread beyond the large banks involved in\ncomplex securitizations, and the smaller banks with sizeable portfolios of construction\nloans, to a larger set of financial institutions. Not surprisingly, in regions where housing\nprices are falling and delinquencies are rising, we are seeing that banks are beginning to\nreduce the lines of credit available to borrowers.\nA second potential problem for banks is that other types of consumer debt can\nsuffer “collateral damage” from the difficulties in the housing sector. Regions that have\nexperienced falling house prices over the past year are also areas that are seeing some of\nthe larger increases in delinquencies on consumer loans. Banks with significant\nconsumer loan exposures are observing that consumer delinquencies are becoming\nelevated in regions most affected by housing problems.\nTo date, credit problems have been focused on large financial institutions, many\nof whom have shown the capacity to raise new capital. However, should the challenges\nin housing continue, problems could expand beyond securitized assets to have an impact\non the nonsecuritized assets held by smaller banking institutions. It is possible that these\ninstitutions may not be able to tap additional capital quite as easily as larger institutions,\nand if so they may be forced to constrain other lending to address any losses. So I leave\nyou with the cautionary note that while small and medium sized businesses have not\ngenerally experienced significant problems with credit availability to date, further\ndeterioration in housing markets, if it occurs, could carry over and begin to impact\nlenders who serve such borrowers.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nII.\n\nLength and Duration of Housing Downturns, and Other Recent Research\nfrom the Boston Fed\nNew England is no stranger to falling asset values. As you no doubt know, during\n\nthe early 1990s, New England experienced a steep decline in housing prices. We at the\nBoston Fed think it may be useful to compare that experience to what we have\nexperienced to date with falling housing prices, and we are pursuing a number of research\navenues to do that.\nA new research paper by Foote, Gerardi, Goette and Willen is one example 8 . The\nauthors have, among other things, done extensive data analysis that allows us to compare\nthe current situation to that earlier episode, using publicly available data from the\nMassachusetts Registry of Deeds compiled into a database by the Warren Group. I will\nsay more about our researchers’ findings in a moment.\nSeparately, we are launching today an interactive mapping feature for our website\nthat tracks the rise in foreclosures and subprime activity, then and now\n(http://www.bos.frb.org/subprimegraphics). The next few slides will give you a rough\nsense of how it displays data -- although the site itself will show the year-by-year\nprogressions, dynamically, and I am going to just show you static shots of given years for\nour purposes here today.\nAs you can see in Figure 4 and 5, Massachusetts moved quite rapidly from a\nsituation of relatively limited foreclosures in 1990 to a period of very high foreclosures in\n1992. The timing is interesting. By late 1989, Massachusetts house prices had begun to\nfall, but delinquencies and foreclosures did not really accelerate until there was also a\nsignificant weakening of the economy. In fact, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts,\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwhich had declined to 3.1 percent in late 1987, peaked at 9.1 percent in the second half of\n1991. Declining housing prices alone did not cause very elevated foreclosures; it was\nsignificantly compounded by an economic shock such as the loss of a job which disrupted\nthe ability of many borrowers to make payments. As house prices fell, many\nhomeowners who lost their jobs in the early-1990s recession could not sell their homes to\npay off their mortgages because they owed more than their homes were worth. For\nunemployed homeowners with “negative equity,” foreclosure was often the only option.\nThe more recent period also points to the importance of falling house prices and\nnegative equity in foreclosures. In the more recent period (shown in Figures 6 and 7), the\nforeclosure rate – which was not particularly elevated in 2005 – had become quite\nelevated by 2007 as house prices softened. This increase in foreclosures occurred even\nthough the Massachusetts unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent for the year.\nWhy are foreclosures so high today, given that the economic situation is so much\nbetter than it was during the early 1990s? Even in expansions, many homeowners\nundergo adverse life events – like a job loss, a divorce, a spike in medical expenses, or\nthe like – that disrupt their ability to make mortgage payments. Of course, with regard to\nunemployment, such household-level disruptions are not as prevalent in expansions as\nthey are in recessions. But when such a life event does occur, it can still precipitate a\nforeclosure if the homeowner has negative equity because of a fall in house prices.\nAnother reason for elevated foreclosures today concerns changes in the\nsusceptibility of mortgages to economic shocks. In the late 1980s, many borrowers had\nmade significant down payments and had good credit histories. But the recent ability of\nborrowers with weak credit histories and little or no down payments to purchase homes,\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\noften with subprime loans (and sometimes with minimal income verification), means that\na greater share of today’s mortgages are a good bit more susceptible to the types of\ndisruptive life events that precipitate foreclosure. These borrowers were fine when\nhousing prices were rising because if needed, they had the ability to refinance or sell their\nhomes and pay off (or more than pay off) their mortgages. In contrast, in the current\nenvironment of falling housing prices, borrowers who made small down-payments or\nhave otherwise risky mortgages are now more likely to end up in foreclosure if they\nexperience an adverse event that interrupts their ability to make mortgage payments.\nSo, in short, we have seen similar foreclosure numbers this time around without a\ntechnical recession, and with a more modest fall in home prices. Boston Fed researchers\nattribute that to the prevalence of riskier loans and higher combined loan-to-value ratios\nin general.\nFigures 8 and 9 provide some background on the foreclosure experience by house\ntype. Several interesting patterns are apparent. In the early 1990s, foreclosures rose\nrapidly for all types of homes as the economy deteriorated. While foreclosures peaked in\n1992, they remained quite elevated through much of the decade, despite the eventual\nrebounding of the economy. In addition, that period’s speculative fervor in New England\nreal estate markets had a particularly large impact on the condo market, where a\ndisproportionate share of the foreclosures occurred.\nToday, problems appear most pronounced in the multifamily market. The twoand three-family houses that are prevalent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods\nin Massachusetts have experienced very elevated foreclosure rates. Specifically, multi-\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nfamily units accounted for 28.4 percent of the foreclosures in 2006-2007, but have\nconstituted only 10.8 percent of residential purchases since 1990 9 (Figure 9).\nThe impact on particular communities can be seen in Figure 10, 10 which shows\nforeclosure petitions by property type in given cities and towns in Massachusetts. In\nBoston, 47 percent of foreclosure petitions between January and August 2007 were multifamily properties. Many of the cities with high concentrations of low- and moderateincome borrowers have also seen particularly high rates of foreclosure petitions 11 on\nmulti-family properties. Our researchers suggest that one explanation for the higher\nforeclosure rate on multi-family properties is found in higher combined loan to value\n(CLTV) ratios, which make them more vulnerable when prices are falling. 12\nStates like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have a much larger concentration of\nmulti-family homes than do many other regions of the country 13 . Streets with a large\nconcentration of foreclosures in major New England cities frequently are dominated by\nmulti-family units. Recently both Boston and Chelsea have begun programs to purchase\nforeclosed multi-family units, to try to prevent these properties from becoming vacant\nand slipping into disrepair, which would bring broader collateral problems for the\naffected neighborhoods.\nBecause many of these properties are investor owned – or the current owner\noccupies one of the units and has limited financial means to deploy should the property\nrequire major capital improvements – programs focused on owner-occupied single-family\nproperties will not address these problems. One area that will need focus going forward\ninvolves strategies to prevent streets of foreclosed multi-unit properties from leading to\nbroader sections of urban decay.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nSeveral lessons from the historical comparison can be highlighted. First, should\nthe economy worsen and suffer a period of significant job losses, the housing problem\ncould become much more severe. Second, past episodes of elevated foreclosures lingered\nwell after the peak in foreclosures had passed, indicating that the duration of today’s\nsituation may be longer than some are anticipating. Third, because the current problems\nhave been concentrated in vulnerable low- and moderate-income areas with a prevalence\nof multi-unit properties, such multi-unit properties will be a more important public policy\nissue in the current situation.\n\nIII.\n\nIssues Complicating the Resolution of Housing Problems\nAs I have noted, a major change in the U.S. housing sector in recent years has\n\nbeen the emergence of the ability to buy homes with little or no down payment and the\nincreased prevalence of such purchases. Many of these purchases are structured with a\nfirst loan that covers 80 percent of the value of the house and a second loan, sometimes\ncalled a “piggyback” loan, which is taken out at the same time as the first. The\npiggyback loan tends to be at a higher interest rate reflecting the greater risk of the loan,\nbut the interest is tax deductible and allows the borrower to avoid purchasing private\nmortgage insurance (which lenders require if the borrower is paying less than 20 percent\nin down payment).\nAs can be seen in Figure 11, until recently, an increasing percentage of homes\nwere being financed with these piggyback loans. In Massachusetts, piggyback loans\nwere used with 26 percent of subprime mortgages in the second quarter of 2003 but that\npercentage increased to 65 percent of subprime mortgages in the third quarter of 2005.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nPiggyback loans were about twice as prevalent for subprime borrowers as prime\nborrowers, and were particularly prevalent in multi-family purchases. In fact, 75 percent\nof subprime multi-family purchases in the third quarter of 2005 involved a piggyback\nloan.\nAt the time of purchase, subprime borrowers frequently used the same lender to\nacquire both the first loan and the piggyback loan. The complicating factor is that these\nloans were frequently then securitized, with the first mortgage and the piggyback loan\noften sold into separate portfolios of loans to be securitized. Thus, even while piggyback\nloans were becoming more abundant, many mortgage-backed securities contained no\npiggyback loans, implying that the borrower’s loans were frequently packaged in separate\nsecuritizations.\nThe combination of piggyback loans, securitization, and legal complexities makes\nit much more difficult to modify loans, particularly if the first and second mortgages have\nbeen packaged into separate securitizations. Dealing with two different lenders or\nservicers, as well as different securitizations, can significantly complicate efforts to\nrestructure loans. Also, loan servicing agreements are not identical and indeed include a\nvariety of forms of authorization (of the servicer) to modify loans. Frequently the only\nleverage the owner of the piggyback loan can and does exercise with a distressed\nborrower is demanding compensation should the borrower seek to modify both loans.\nIn short, while a variety of programs and policies are being considered in order to\nimprove the loan modification process for distressed borrowers and their lenders, a key\nconsideration involves figuring out how to modify loans when the interests of the primary\nloan holder may be different than those of the holder of the piggyback loan.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nA second complication involves targeting the modifications to the homeowners\nwho really need them. We have seen that falling house prices tend to raise foreclosures\nby causing a negative equity situation which limits homeowners’ options (e.g., to\nrefinance or sell and pay off the loan) if their financial situation deteriorates.\nThe rising share of homeowners with negative equity in their house – meaning\ntheir home is now worth less than their loan(s) – might seem to suggest a large group for\nwhom loan modifications would be a “slam dunk.” Principal write-downs to bring\n“underwater” mortgages above water may well be the appropriate solution for some\ntroubled borrowers 14 , but lenders and loan servicers continue to be reluctant to provide\nmodifications in a wholesale manner. Negative equity does not imply foreclosure with\ncertainty – in fact, most people with negative equity situations continue to make their\nmortgage payments. Lenders and loan servicers who are aware of this fact may be\nreluctant to offer a modification if they believe that the homeowner has the capacity to\ncontinue making payments, no matter the hardship.\nTo “unpack” this a bit, I want to spend a moment looking at the history of\nnegative-equity borrowers over the past two decades, drawing on a new working paper\njust produced by Boston Fed researchers 15 .\nIn the late 1980s, house-price declines in New England meant a large number of\nborrowers had negative equity in their house. The Registry of Deeds data allow us to\nstudy the historical relationship between negative equity and foreclosures for a limited set\nof borrowers – specifically, people who purchased homes in Massachusetts on or after\nJanuary 1987, when the Warren Group data begin. Using these data to calculate a rough\nproxy for housing equity, Foote, Gerardi and Willen calculate that 100,288 of these post-\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n1987 purchasers, or 36 percent, were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth\nquarter of 1991 (a high fraction because January 1987 came just before the peak of the\nhousing cycle). 16 Yet of this negative-equity group, only 6,453 (or just 6.4 percent)\ndefaulted on their mortgages within the following three years.\nWhat about today? Using the same rough method to approximate home equity for\nthe same subset of homeowners, the data imply that about 10 percent of post-1987\npurchasers were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth quarter of 2007.\nAssuming that the unemployment rate and benchmark interest rate (the 6-month London\nInterbank Offered Rate or LIBOR) stay at their fourth-quarter 2007 levels, the statistical\ndefault model of Gerardi, Shapiro and Willen predicts that less than 10 percent of these\nhomeowners with negative equity will default.\nContinued declines in house prices, higher unemployment, and possibly a greater\nwillingness to default on home mortgages might raise this estimate of future defaults.\nEven so, many lenders will not be inclined to make concessions unless borrowers clearly\nlack the ability to pay. This is one reason that workouts or distressed borrowers’\nmortgages continue to proceed loan by loan, rather than through wholesale changes in\nmortgage terms. Lenders want borrowers with the capacity to pay to continue to uphold\ntheir legal obligation to do so – and any wholesale change in mortgage terms could\nbenefit borrowers that are still able to fulfill the original agreement. To avoid this\nproblem, some policy proposals 17 maintain the legal obligation for the full loan for the\nborrower, but involve significantly reduced payments in return for the lender sharing in\nany future appreciation of the house.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAnother impediment to restructuring loans that have been packaged into\nsecuritizations involves the legal restrictions imposed on many securitization\nagreements 18 . These agreements allow the servicer to pass through payments by\nborrowers without incurring any tax liability, as long as certain conditions are met. One\nof the conditions is usually that modifications cannot be made to the loans unless the loan\nis either in default or default is reasonably foreseeable. This determination is generally\nmade loan by loan, with wholesale modifications being interpreted by some servicers as\npossibly violating the service agreement and the legal framework used in many\nsecuritizations and thus potentially imposing tax liability.\nDespite some promising proposals, these factors – the presence of piggyback\nloans, the desire of lenders to continue to get paid unless the borrower does not have the\ncapacity to make payments, and the legal restrictions and tax-liability concerns\nsurrounding securitization agreements – make any across-the-board modification of loan\nterms challenging.\nAs long as loan modifications are taking place on a loan-by-loan basis (a timeconsuming and labor-intensive process), to significantly increase the number of loan\nmodifications and avoid significant numbers of foreclosures, many servicers will need to\nquickly expand the pool of staff capable of making these evaluations.\n\nIV.\n\nImplications for Policymakers\nTo reiterate, falling housing prices continue to be a significant source of down-\n\nside risk to the economy. Previous periods of real estate problems have taken significant\ntime to be worked out, with foreclosures remaining elevated well after their peak. The\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncurrent foreclosure problem has been exacerbated by the difficulties related to many of\nthe problem loans being held in securities.\nTo help mitigate the current situation it is important for servicers to have the\ncapacity and the incentive to make loan modifications where appropriate. A challenge\ncontinues to arise around getting borrowers and servicers together to determine if loan\nmodifications are appropriate.\nIn addition, it is clear that servicers were not set up for the spate of elevated\nforeclosures we have already experienced, and further increases in foreclosures would\ncertainly test the capacity of servicers to have sufficient staff with the expertise to make\nloan modification determinations. Nonetheless, I am hopeful that the many mortgage\nforums that are being organized around the country to try to get servicers and borrowers\ntogether to work with problem loans will help some borrowers.\nThe large number of multi-family dwellings entering foreclosure presents a\nserious challenge to cities. Already there are streets in some cities with a high\nconcentration of foreclosed multi-family properties, putting at risk many of the\nsocioeconomic advances made in the last decade in some of these neighborhoods. Cities,\nworking together and with community organizations and state officials, 19 will need to\nfind ways to make sure these low- and moderate-income neighborhoods do not regress as\na result of the current wave of foreclosures. One promising tactic is rigorous municipalcode enforcement that ensures foreclosed properties are maintained. Furthermore,\nservicers must have a process for maintaining foreclosed properties and they must do\nmore to ensure that these properties do not remain vacant for long periods of time.\n\n16\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nFinally, the legal structure for securitizations and mortgage-servicing agreements\nclearly did not foresee the widespread emergence of distressed borrowers, delinquencies,\nand foreclosures that are being experienced. Changes to servicing agreements and\nsecuritization structures that allow more flexibility during times of duress and also\naddress servicers’ liability concerns are necessary. Since different investors in a\nmortgage-backed security have different incentives, more clearly defining the governance\nof these securities would make it easier during difficult times to make modifications that\nare in the borrower’s, servicer’s, and investor’s interests.\nThe extent of eventual housing problems is highly dependent on the outlook for\nthe economy and the future path of housing prices. Fortunately, aggressive monetary and\nfiscal policy actions have been taken to help mitigate some of the downside risk. These\npolicies will likely result in some pick up in economic activity in the second half of this\nyear, which should help to stabilize the housing market.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\n2\n\nA comprehensive description of the Bear Stearns situation is available in “Actions\nby the New York Fed in Response to Liquidity Pressures in Financial Markets” –\nTestimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs by\nTimothy F. Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York (April 3, 2008).\n\n3\n\nGDP is essentially the value of goods and services put in place during a time\nperiod, and residential investment is the housing component of GDP. “The main\n17\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nindicator of the quantity of new housing supplied to the economy is the residential fixed\ninvestment series from the national income and product accounts. Residential investment\nis made up of new construction put in place, expenditures on maintenance and home\nimprovement, equipment purchased for use in residential structures (e.g., washers and\ndryers purchased by landlords and rented out to tenants), and brokerage commissions.”\n(Source: “Residential Investment over the Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter #2006-15; June 30, 2006).\n\"Brokers’ commissions…are part of the cost of acquiring a house and, therefore, a capital\nexpenditure.\" (Source: \"National and Regional Housing Patterns\" by Lynn Elaine\nBrowne in the New England Economic Review, July/August 2000, published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston).\n4\n\nIn essence “subprime” loans refer to mortgages that have a higher risk of default\nthan prime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. Certain lenders\nspecialize in subprime loans, which carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher risk.\nCertain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks,\nespecially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans, although a\nfew large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers\nto the credit characteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have\nweakened credit histories that include payment delinquencies and possibly more severe\nproblems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display\nreduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other\ncriteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime loans\nare loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the time of\norigination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime\nborrowers. Generally, subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk\ncharacteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two or more 30-day\ndelinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24\nmonths; Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months;\nBankruptcy in the last 5 years; Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, for\nexample, a credit bureau risk score (FICO) of 660 or below (depending on the\nproduct/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default\nprobability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or\notherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly\ndebt-service requirements from monthly income.”\n5\n\nThe amount outstanding of revolving, open-ended loans secured by 1-4 family\nresidential properties and extended under lines of credit.\n6\n\nClosed-end loans secured by junior (i.e., other than first) liens on 1-4 family\nresidential properties.\n7\n\nDelinquencies on first mortgage loans and junior liens were not reported\nseparately by banks until 2002.\n18\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M.

A table that provides the composition of\nhousing units by state can be found at\nhttp://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/units.html\n14\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke is one of a number of\npolicymakers urging lenders to consider principal writedowns, for example in speeches\ngiven on March 4 and May 5\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080304a.htm and\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20080505a.htm).\n15\n\n“Negative Equity and Foreclosure: Theory and Evidence” by Paul S. Willen,\nKristopher Gerardi, and Chris Foote (forthcoming).\n16\n\nFor this calculation, equity is estimated as the sum of initial equity at purchase\n(that is, the downpayment) plus an estimate of cumulative house price appreciation for\nthat particular home. This estimate is a rough measure for two reasons. First, the data do\nnot allow an estimate of the principal that has been paid down during the life of the\nmortgage. Second, there is no allowance for cash-out refinancing or other types of equity\nwithdrawal. The first of these influences would cause the estimate of home equity to be\ntoo small, while the second would cause the equity estimate to be too large. It is unclear\nwhich factor is quantitatively more important.\n17\n\nSuch as the proposed “Appreciating America” approach, which would have the\nfollowing characteristics (see Refinance.com):\n\n19\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n The homeowner would refinance the outstanding mortgage(s) with an approved\n\"Appreciating America Lender,\" in accordance with established FHA guidelines (i.e.\nwith respect to loan to value and debt to income ratios).\n The first mortgage would be set at some percentage of the current market value of the\nhome (e.g., 85 percent) and would be insured by FHA.\n A second mortgage would be formed to cover the difference between the original\nmortgage balance and the FHA-insured new mortgage, and would be held by the\ncurrent mortgage servicer. Payments and interest (6 percent) on this new second\nmortgage would be deferred for five years or until the home is sold (whichever comes\nfirst).\n To the extent that the value of the home at that point is greater than the FHA first\nmortgage amount, the homeowner would first receive an amount equal to all capital\nimprovements made to the property since the Appreciating America Mortgage closed;\nthen the homeowner would receive 30 percent of the appreciation, and the second\nmortgage holder would receive the lesser of 70 percent of the appreciation or the\nprincipal and accrued interest on the Appreciating America Second Mortgage. All\nappreciation in excess of the second mortgage balance including accrued interest\nwould belong to the homeowner.\n18\n\nThe legal vehicle used for securitized mortgages is a Real Estate Mortgage\nInvestment Conduit (REMIC), which is a pass-through tax entity and investment vehicle\nthat holds a pool of commercial and residential mortgages in trust and issues securities\n(often in multiple classes based on maturity and risk) that represent an undivided interest\nin those mortgages. Major issuers of REMICs include the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCompany (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).\nREMICs are governed by the sections 860A through 860G of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn order to qualify as a REMIC, all of the interests must consist of one or more classes of\nregular interest and one (only one) class of residual interest.\nAn entity that initially qualifies as a REMIC may cease to qualify if a sufficiently\nlarge portion of its qualified mortgages are “significantly modified” and the modified\nobligations are not qualified mortgages. A qualified mortgage is usually treated as having\nbeen significantly modified if the change in terms would be treated as an exchange of\nobligations under section 1001 and its regulations. However, certain changes to the terms\nof an obligation are not considered signification modifications for this purpose,\nnotwithstanding the fact that they may be significant modifications under section 1001\nand § 1.1001-3. The four permitted modifications are (1) Changes in the terms of the\nobligation occasioned by default or a reasonably foreseeable default; (2) Assumption of\nthe obligation; (3) Waiver of a due-on-sale clause or a due on encumbrance clause; and\n(4) Conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the terms of a convertible\nmortgage.\nAs echoed in many Servicing Agreements, the most pertinent modification is one\ninduced by either default or impending default. The problem lies in ascertaining with\nsome certainty whether default is “reasonably foreseeable” and thus servicers have been\nreticent to go forward with modifications based on this shaky standard when the potential\nconsequences are so dire.\n20\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M.

The effects of significant increases in food and energy prices are\nstill feeding through the economy, as are the impacts of appropriately aggressive\nmonetary and fiscal policy responses to the recent financial turmoil and its spillover\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\neffects. As a result of all these developments, consumers, commentators, and\npolicymakers are intensely interested in the current outlook for inflation.\nFood- and gas-price increases – so-called supply shocks – have heightened\neveryone’s awareness that the total consumer price index (CPI) has increased 3.9 percent\nover the past year; clearly an undesirable outcome. As consumers, we all buy food and\ngas with high frequency, so sharp relative price movements for these goods get our\nimmediate attention. Furthermore, if sustained, such increases in food and energy prices,\nwhich are not currently suggested by food and energy futures prices, would raise concern\nthat these commodity price increases could become embedded in expectations – clearly\nan outcome to be avoided.\nDespite these recent supply shocks, the central tendency of the forecasts of the\nFederal Reserve Presidents and Governors indicates that total personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation and core PCE inflation are expected to move downward, to\naround or below 2 percent over the next two years (Table 1). While many private\nforecasts do not yet extend out through 2010, many that do are broadly consistent with\nthe central tendency reported after the April Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting.\nThese baseline forecasts indicate a general expectation among many analysts,\nforecasters, and policymakers that inflationary pressures will moderate. However, there\nremain significant disagreements over which factors are the most important determinants\nof future inflation. It is my hope that this conference will help facilitate – and indeed\nsharpen – the debate and provide some empirical support for our thinking on the inflation\noutlook and the implications for monetary policy.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday in these opening remarks I simply want to highlight and briefly mention\nsome of the key empirical questions that I expect will be addressed in greater depth in the\nconference presentations and discussions.\n\n The first empirical question involves the role that domestic excess capacity (for\nexample, unemployed workers) plays in reducing inflation. Does sizable\nexcess capacity in the economy significantly reduce future inflation? This\nquestion is at the heart of discussions of the Phillips Curve and its relevance\nfor forecasting inflation.\n\n The second question involves the divergence between core inflation and total\ninflation. Many forecasters – including many central bankers – use the core\ninflation rate as an indicator of future total inflation trends. Is that use of core\ninflation prudent? How will these two measures, core inflation and total\ninflation, converge over time? A closely-related question centers on higher\nfood and energy prices: how important is the “pass-through” of these price\nchanges to the core and overall inflation rates?\n\n And the third question involves the impact of relative price changes on labor\nmarkets. Specifically, under what circumstances do inflationary pressures\naffect inflation expectations, and become embedded in wage and salary\nincreases? In the current environment, we need to gauge the likelihood that\ninflationary pressures will cause further upward pressures on wages and\nsalaries.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nI.\n\nExcess Capacity and Inflation\nA key element of the Phillips Curve framework is the assumption that significant\n\nexcess capacity in the economy should exert downward pressure on inflation. While this\nkey link in the Phillips framework provokes considerable skepticism in some quarters, it\nnonetheless serves as the underpinning of the inflation forecast for many private\nforecasters, much of Wall Street, and indeed many of the models utilized within the\nFederal Reserve System. 2\nThis widespread use reflects the fact that forecasts of inflation do seem to\nimprove when measures of excess capacity are incorporated. 3 These models derive their\nsuccess from the simple empirical observation that during recessionary periods, the\ninflation rate tends to fall (Figure 1). Over the past 50 years, the rate of total CPI\ninflation has tended to be lower after a recession than before; and the proxies for excess\ncapacity capture this business cycle regularity. The intuition behind this empirical\nregularity is that, with widespread current and expected excess capacity, firms have\ngreater difficulty increasing prices, workers’ expectations of inflation decline, and they\nthus demand smaller wage increases. As a result, during a recession wage and price\ninflation slow, and the economy returns to full employment with a lower equilibrium\ninflation rate.\nDespite the heavy reliance on a Phillips Curve empirical framework in many\nmodels, the extent and reliability of the short-run tradeoff between excess capacity and\nthe inflation rate remain matters of much debate. In addition, how inflation expectations\nare set remains an issue that economists are only beginning to understand, and an area of\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nconsiderable disagreement. As both questions are very important for policy, I look\nforward to a thorough discussion of these issues over the next two days.\n\nII.\n\nIssues around Core and Total Inflation Rates, and their Divergence\nIn the long run, in my view, it is total inflation – rather than core inflation, which\n\nexcludes the volatile food and energy components – that should be the focus of monetary\npolicy. 4 However, total inflation is typically much more strongly influenced by\ntemporary changes in relative prices than core inflation. This suggests a potential role for\ncore inflation as an indicator of the subsequent trajectory of total inflation – so I want to\nspend a few minutes focusing on the impact of relative price changes on inflation, and on\nthe relationship between core and total inflation measures.\nAs shown in Figure 2, total CPI has been more volatile than core CPI, as food and\nenergy prices have been much less stable than many of the other components of inflation.\nBecause the volatility in food and energy components is largely transitory, many focus on\nthe core rate of inflation as a “medium-term” indicator of where inflation is trending.\nIn gauging the usefulness of core inflation as an indicator of inflation’s trend, one\nmight perform the following simple exercise: see whether, when total inflation and core\ninflation show significant divergence, the core inflation rate moves to the total inflation\nrate over time, or the total inflation rate moves to the core? 5\nOne would expect the core to move to the total if aggregate inflation expectations\nconsistently reflect a large part of the volatile changes in food and energy prices that arise\nfrom periodic supply shocks. If, instead, such supply shocks are seen as producing a\ntemporary change in relative prices – and as a result are not incorporated into inflationary\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nexpectations – then one would expect total inflation to converge to the underlying rate of\ncore inflation.\nThis is more than just an academic debate. Over the last four years, rising food\nand energy prices have caused total inflation to be significantly higher than core inflation.\nFigure 3 plots, over ten years, the gap between total inflation and core inflation against\nthe total inflation rate two years ahead. The relationship between the two shows that, at\nleast in this period, when total inflation is higher than core inflation, total inflation tends\nto move down to close the gap. 6\nFigure 4 plots the same gap between total inflation and core inflation against the\ncore rate of inflation two years ahead. In this case there is no relationship, indicating that\nat least in this period core inflation does not rise following an increase in the spread\nbetween total and core inflation. 7, 8\nGiven that total inflation has been higher than core inflation for the last several\nyears, will core inflation tend to rise to close the gap, or will the total inflation rate fall to\nclose the gap? Work under way in the Boston Fed’s research department, forthcoming in\na discussion paper, would seem to indicate the latter; however, we urge participants at\nthis conference to share their views and help improve understanding of this important\ntopic.\nOf course, closely related to the question of how core and total inflation converge\nis the issue of how large movements in food and energy prices might differentially affect\ncore versus total inflation – the so-called “pass-through” of food and energy prices into\ninflation. 9 The observation that, of late, total inflation tends to converge to core inflation\nwould seem to imply that higher food and energy prices have a significant concurrent\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nimpact on the total inflation rate, but have little contemporaneous effect on core inflation,\nand little or no lasting effect on either. Food and energy prices, this observation implies,\nare likely to have little impact on longer-run expectations of inflation.\nHowever, some have raised concerns that the future behavior of inflation may\nlook different than the past, perhaps because food and energy price increases will no\nlonger be transitory, but will instead become an enduring feature of the economic\nlandscape. Rising food and energy prices could become the norm if demand for these\ncommodities outstrips supply on a continuous or prolonged basis.\nIt is important to note, however, that futures prices do not generally reflect an\nexpectation that oil prices will continue rising at their recent rapid rate. In the past,\nhigher oil prices have spurred conservation efforts and contributed to slower economic\ngrowth – both reducing energy demand. Higher oil prices also encouraged new\ntechnological improvements, and exploration and production from higher-cost sources –\nincreasing supply. In other words, economists expect that the laws of supply and demand\nwill ultimately limit price increases – even in the face of relatively rapid economic\ngrowth in emerging markets. That said, it seems to be taking quite a long time to date for\nlong-run supply and demand influences to rein in oil price increases. You might say the\nshort run is getting longer every day.\nAnother frequent explanation for recent oil prices increases is that dollar\ndepreciation has boosted the demand for oil in strong-currency countries while\ndiscouraging oil output in the oil-producing countries. However, the strength of the\nstatistical correlation between the exchange rate and oil prices is modest at best. As\nFigure 5 shows, while the price of oil is indeed correlated with the exchange rate, the\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncumulative change in the exchange rate pales in comparison to the enormous run-up in oil\nprices – in other words, the exchange rate cannot explain more than a very small fraction\nof the change in the dollar price of oil.\nFinally, even if oil prices do continue to rise much faster than U.S. core inflation\nfor an extended period, the experience of the past 20 years (shown in Figure 6) indicates\nthat there is a relatively low correlation between oil price movements and the underlying\ncore rate of inflation. 10 More comprehensive statistical work by researchers at the\nBoston Reserve Bank concludes that the impact of relative price shocks from oil – and\nother related supply shocks – has had a very minor impact on the underlying rate of\ninflation. 11 Of course, we know that not everyone here shares that view, and we look\nforward to hearing other perspectives on this issue over the course of the next two days.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Impact on Labor Markets\nA question related to substantial supply shocks is whether labor contracts will\n\nstart to incorporate higher wage demands intended to offset rising price pressures. If\nworkers believe that underlying inflation will be higher over time as a result of increases\nin food and energy prices, they may begin demanding higher wages and salaries to match\ntheir expectations of future inflation.\nThe determinants of worker expectations remain a relative unknown in\neconomics. We know that a wide variety of factors can affect expectations, factors\nranging from past rates of inflation to sophisticated forecasts of future inflation which\nend up being consistent with economists’ models. The role that the Federal Reserve may\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nplay in the formation of those expectations has been an issue of discussion and debate for\neconomists since the late 1970s; it continues to be so.\nIn any event, workers’ ability to demand higher wages and salaries is likely to\ndepend on the competitiveness and structure of labor markets, as well as on broader\neconomic conditions. Recent increases in U.S. wages and salaries have been quite\nmodest and do not show evidence of “ratcheting up” related to recent supply shocks (see\nFigure 7).\nLike the inflation rate, increases in wages and salaries have, historically, slowed\nduring recessions. Since wages and salaries are an important component of overall costs,\none can argue that the excess capacity that exists during recessions is an important\nelement in dampening wage and salary demands – and as a result plays the role in the\ninflation framework that is embedded in the Phillips Curve.\nWork done in the Research Department at the Boston Fed indicates that recent\nwage and salary growth has not reflected increased inflationary expectations or a\nsignificant reaction to recent supply shocks. Because these conclusions have important\npolicy implications, we hope the conference will include a vigorous discussion of the\nevidence on this issue.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn short introductory remarks like these, it is impossible to do justice to the topic\nof understanding inflation dynamics and how they might impact monetary policy. That is\nexactly why we were eager to seize the opportunity presented by the Phillips Curve\nanniversary and organize a conference devoted to the topic. Fortunately, those who are\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\npresenting and discussing papers have the opportunity to delve into the issues in much\nmore depth than I have been able to, today.\nAs I believe this conference will show, the past 50 years have brought significant\nadvances in our understanding of these issues. Building from the relatively primitive\nrelationship embodied in the Phillips Curve, economic researchers are now in the process\nof developing a much more robust understanding of inflation dynamics.\nAnd in my view, one area that provides particularly promising opportunities for\nfurther research is inflation expectations. Early Phillips-Curve models used simple rules\nof thumb to capture how inflation expectations are set. But increasingly, economists are\nstarting to develop a more rigorous understanding of how inflation expectations are\nestablished. I anticipate that the burgeoning field of behavioral economics will greatly\nimprove our understanding of how individuals set their expectations and how consumers,\nfirms, and workers react to supply shocks and other macroeconomic issues. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston’s Research Center for Behavioral Economics and\nDecisionmaking 12 is devoting a good deal of attention to these issues.\nAlthough many economists have done extensive work on inflation dynamics, I\nstrongly suspect that this conference will highlight that there is still plenty of work to be\ndone. And like all of you here, I look forward to hearing about some of the new research\nthat is currently under way. My hope for this conference is that each of us will gain a\nnumber of insights that will allow us to better understand our interesting and at times\nchallenging macroeconomic environment – and that will help those of us who are\npolicymakers to better serve the public’s interests. So I wish you a very engaging two\ndays.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M.

These\ncomments have benefited from extensive discussions with members of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston’s research department, in particular with economists Jeff Fuhrer, Geoffrey Tootell,\nJane Little and Giovanni Olivei.\n\n2\n\nSee for example the following articles which discuss the robustness of the Phillips Curve.\nFuhrer, Jeff C. “The Phillips Curve is Alive and Well” New England Economic Review\n(March/April 1995 – http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer1995/neer295c.htm) and Barnes,\nMichelle L. and Giovanni Olivei, “Inside and Outside Bounds: Threshhold Estimates of the\nPhillips Curve,” New England Economic Review (2003 –\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2003/neer03a.pdf)\n\n3\n\nOf course, the models may differ in their measures of excess capacity. Some measure\nexcess capacity as the difference between the unemployment rate and the estimated NonAccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). Others may use the “GDP gap” – the\ndifference between the actual and potential output of goods and services in an economy. Others\nuse a cost-based measure of excess capacity, typified by the “New Keynesian Phillips Curves”\nthat rely on a measure of the inflation-adjusted marginal cost of output.\n4\n\nOf course, some observers disagree that we should target total, not core, inflation,\narguing that a central bank should target things it can control (domestic prices) not those it\ncannot.\n5\n\nJeff Fuhrer, and Geoff Tootell have done more extensive work examining the statistical\nrelationship between core and total inflation, to be forthcoming.\n\n6\n\nFigure 3: R2 = 0.3961; y = -1.0143x + 0.7406\n(-4.5095) (2.2481) t-statistics in parenthesis\n\n7\n\nFigure 4: R2 = 0.0926; y = 0.1817x - 0.0039\n(1.7791) (-0.0261)\n\nt-statistics in parenthesis\n\n8\n\nNotably, if we plot these relationships for an earlier time period, 1970-1990, the results\nare very different. When total inflation diverged from core inflation, total inflation did not move\ndown to close the gap.\n9\n\nOf course, food and energy prices are just a subset of the factors outside the gap or\nPhillips Curve framework that could periodically affect core inflation. Other factors that could\nshift the Phillips Curve from time to time include other commodity prices, import prices and the\nexchange rate.\n\n10\n\nThe weakness in the relationship between changes in oil prices and the underlying\ninflation rate is highlighted by the fact that over a thirty-year period the correlation is low and\npositive whereas over a twenty- or ten-year period the correlation is low and negative.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire\nand the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce\n\nManchester, New Hampshire\nSeptember 3, 2008\n\nI am pleased to be with you today in New Hampshire, and would like to share\nsome perspectives on the implications of a credit crunch. 1 Unfortunately, a credit crunch\nis not an entirely new topic for those of you who have been doing business in New\nHampshire for some time, since you experienced the early 1990s – when many of the\nlarger banks in the state failed, and credit availability was an acute problem.\nToday, banking and real estate problems are less severe in New England than they\nare in many other parts of the country. However, on a national scale the “headwinds”\npushing against the economy look to be a good bit stronger than those experienced in the\nearly 1990s.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nOver the course of this summer it became clear that the economic headwinds have\nnot subsided as hoped. With some help from tax rebates and previous interest-rate cuts,\nthe second quarter was better than many had feared; however, most private forecasters\nare expecting significantly slowed growth in the second half of this year – as residential\ninvestment continues to be a drag on the economy, as consumers tighten up on their\nspending, as the impact of the Federal tax rebate subsides, and as weakness among some\nof our major trading partners makes the outlook for many exports more restrained.\nWith the economy expected to expand at a rate below its potential in the second\nhalf of this year, further increases in the unemployment rate are possible. It now appears\nthat the national unemployment rate may rise above 6 percent, an increase of more than\none and a quarter percentage points – or about 2 million workers – from last August,\nwhen the financial problems emerged.\nContributing to this weakness, in my view, is a significant change in the nature of\nthe financial problems facing the economy. In particular, the financial problems that\ninitially created a liquidity crunch 2 have now evolved into a more traditional credit\ncrunch.\nBefore discussing a credit crunch, allow me to describe what I mean by a liquidity\ncrunch. Simply put, the reluctance of banks to lend to each other became quite elevated,\nbeginning in July 2007. A combination of balance sheet constraints, poor transparency\nregarding potential losses, and concerns about heightened counterparty risk contributed to\nless liquid financial markets. Uncertainty over asset valuations increased, and banks\nbecame reluctant to take on counterparty risk with certain financial institutions –\nparticularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nTurning to the notion of a credit crunch, we see that mounting losses at financial\ninstitutions, and an increasing reluctance among investors to invest new capital while the\neconomic outlook is unclear, are forcing financial institutions to “shrink their balance\nsheets.”\nAllow me to explain that notion for the non-bankers here today. Recall that a loan\nis counted as an asset on a bank’s balance sheet. Banks hold capital in part as a reserve\nagainst the possibility that a loan will default. Thus banks attempt to maintain a\nreasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its\ncapital or an increase in its assets (for example as credit lines that were extended in better\ntimes are tapped), 3 the bank must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in\norder to restore its desired capital-to-asset ratio.\nIn other words, the bank becomes more restrictive in its lending. This shrinkage\nin lending entails tighter underwriting standards, wider interest rate margins, and reduced\ncredit availability.\nAn alternative is to raise more capital, but this can be quite difficult in times like\nthese, when investors are wary of putting more money into some seemingly fragile\nfinancial institutions. Witness the reliance, particularly by some large, well-known\ninstitutions, on foreign sources of capital like the sovereign wealth funds in recent\nmonths.\nThis seemingly technical issue of banks’ balance sheets is no small matter for the\nbroader economy. Because a bank extends loans that are many times the value of its\ncapital base – the hallmark of a “leveraged” institution – the result is that when a bank’s\ncapital loses value, it must reduce its loans by much more in order to maintain its capital-\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nasset ratio. In numeric terms, for a bank seeking to maintain a 10 percent capital-to-asset\nratio, the bank would need to reduce assets – like loans – by $10 for every $1 lost in\ncapital. 4\nToday I am going to discuss the implications of a credit crunch – specifically, the\neffects of a credit crunch on the degree of stimulus that is provided by monetary policy.\nIn particular, I will discuss how a low Federal Funds rate provides much less stimulus\nduring a credit crunch than it otherwise would – because those low rates for inter-bank\nloans do not necessarily translate into lower costs to the vast majority of borrowers who\nrely on funding sources outside the Federal Funds market.\nTo preview the punch line, let me say that looking only at the Federal Funds rate\nduring periods of significant economic headwinds will, in my view, provide a misleading\ngauge of the degree of monetary stimulus that the Federal Reserve has put in place. At\nsuch times, a low Federal Funds rate does not signal a particularly accommodative\nmonetary policy, but rather offsets some of the contraction that would otherwise occur as\nfinancial institutions tighten credit standards and offer borrowing rates with a spread over\nthe Federal Funds rate that is larger than usual (in other words, larger than would be the\ncase outside of credit crunch conditions).\nThat said, make no mistake: in my view, credit conditions would likely be much\nworse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds rate and taken several\ninnovative steps to enhance liquidity in the marketplace – steps like opening our new\nTerm Auction Facility and other facilities that complement our traditional “Discount\nWindow” for banks.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nI. Overview of recent financial issues\nFor context I would like to provide an overview, as I see it, of the recent financial\nturmoil. Over a year ago, problems stemming from large losses in securities backed by\nsubprime 5 loans led to a liquidity crunch. While the initial trigger for the financial\nturbulence was related to subprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of\ncomplicated financial instruments caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and\nmarkets that depend on securitization – including state and municipal financing, student\nloans, and commercial real estate. Inter-bank lending markets, mortgage markets tied to\nsecuritization, and short-term assets financed through the commercial paper market\nexperienced sharply wider spreads and significant declines in volumes.\nAt the time, it was hoped that these problems would be short-lived. However,\nafter one year, while the spreads have fluctuated they remain quite elevated by historical\nstandards.\nThe initial liquidity problems soon created credit problems at large financial\ninstitutions with significant exposure to these markets. While it is true that significant\nnew capital has been raised, for many institutions the new capital only partially offset\nlosses and provided little cushion for potential additional losses.\nIn addition, the continued decline in housing prices has caused problems to extend\nwell beyond the larger banks active in complicated financial arrangements. Falling\nhousing prices, coupled with a rising unemployment rate, are contributing to increases in\nnon-performing loans – on prime as well as subprime mortgages, on construction loans,\nand on home equity loans (see Figure 1).\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs problems have extended to a broader set of financial institutions, concerns that\nthe financial condition of leveraged institutions will create a more traditional credit\ncrunch have increased. The last time a significant credit crunch occurred in the United\nStates was in the early 1990s.\nAt that time, falling commercial real estate prices in New England, the MidAtlantic, and California caused large losses of capital for banks in those regions. Many\nbanks had little success in attracting new capital, and instead shrank their assets to\nimprove their capital ratios. 6 Because of the implication of leverage that I mentioned\nearlier, banks’ capital losses can have a magnified impact on the overall economy.\nIt had been hoped by many observers that consolidation in the banking industry\nand growth in securitization would make a 1990s-style credit crunch less likely.\nUnfortunately, that is not how things have worked out.\nAs we all know, there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry\n(see Figure 2). It was hoped that banks with a more national footprint would be less\nsusceptible to regional shocks and thus more able to lend during regional downturns.\nUnfortunately, many of the largest commercial and investment banks had a significant\nconcentration of their assets in complex securities that have declined in value, had\nsignificant exposures to subprime mortgages or so-called “Alt A” mortgages that have\ndeclined in value, and also had exposure to construction and residential loans that have\nsuffered from national rather than just regional declines in value.\nIn terms of securitization, the loss of confidence in complex financial instruments\nand their ratings has dried up the demand for all but the simplest and least-risky\nsecuritizations. So rather than serving as a shock absorber for banking problems, it seems\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthat securitization has actually exacerbated the problem. Indeed, a wide variety of loans\nthat were once widely securitized are now not available (e.g., subprime mortgages) or are\nonly available from financial institutions at much higher costs (e.g., jumbo loans).\n\nII. Credit availability for businesses\nNow with that context, I’d like to comment on the current state of credit\navailability for businesses.\nThe 1990s credit crunch was primarily a problem for small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that were dependent on their bank for credit – businesses that found credit less\navailable as their bank reduced assets to improve its capital ratio. As I suggested earlier,\nbanks can choose to shrink assets in several ways – by raising rates, tightening credit\nstandards, or refusing to roll over loans and lines of credit that expire.\nA useful indicator of bank lending practices has been the Federal Reserve’s senior\nloan officer survey, which asks senior loan officers from large domestic banks as well as\nforeign banks with branches in the United States a series of questions. Numerous\nacademic studies have found that the survey can be useful in estimating credit restraint\nand its impact on bank-sensitive components of GDP. 7\nFigure 3 provides the responses of loan officers asked if their bank had tightened\nlending standards for commercial and industrial loans to firms over the past three months.\nAs the figure shows, the results of the July 2008 survey indicated that nearly 60 percent\nof banks had tightened their lending standards for large firms and 65 percent had\ntightened their lending standards for small firms. This was the largest percentage of\nbanks tightening commercial and industrial loan standards for small firms in the survey’s\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nhistory, which includes both the 2001 and 1990 recessions (and the number for large\nfirms is right in the vicinity of the observations from those eras).\nFigure 4 shows the survey answers to the question of whether lenders had\nincreased spreads – in other words the amount by which their loan rates exceed the\nbank’s cost of funds. In July, about 80 percent of domestic banks said that they had\nincreased their loan rates for large firms relative to their cost of funds, and roughly 70\npercent of banks said they had increased their loan rates for small firms relative to their\ncost of funds. These responses represent the highest net percentage of banks reporting\nthat they had increased interest-rate spreads on commercial and industrial loans in the\nsurvey’s history.\nFigure 5 relates to the survey’s question on whether domestic respondents had\ntightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans. Again, the results of the\nJuly survey are at high points for the series, exceeding the peak that occurred during the\nearly 1990s.\nIn sum, these results indicate that the financial problems at banks are beginning to\nbe reflected in reduced lending to businesses. The tightening already appears to be more\nwidespread than it was during the early 1990s (the “economic headwinds” period), and\nportends more difficulty in financing business fixed investment and commercial real\nestate projects in the second half of this year.\nAt least for large firms, an alternative to bank financing is to go directly to the\nbond market to raise funds. Figure 6 shows the Moody’s “Aaa” grade bond yields and\nthe effective Federal Funds rate over the past 20 years. High-grade bond yields tend to\nfall during periods where the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy and the economy\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nis experiencing a significant slowdown. However, to date – despite a significant\nreduction in the Federal Funds rate target from 5.25 to 2 percent – the corporate bond\nyield has remained little changed from its level just before the financial problems first\nemerged in August 2007.\nThus, while the Federal Reserve has lowered the Federal Funds rate, interest rates\npaid by businesses have not reflected this easing. Banks have increased their spreads on\nbusiness lending and investors have continued to demand relatively high yields on bonds\nissued by highly credit-worthy borrowers.\n\nIII. Consumer credit conditions\nSimilarly, consumer credit practices have also undergone significant changes of\nlate, as banks have underwritten consumer mortgages and credit card loans, but have\nincreasingly sold many of those loans in the secondary market. With an active secondary\nmarket provided by the securitization of these loans, it was again widely anticipated that\nthe availability of these types of credit would be relatively protected from credit supply\nshocks.\nThat, however, has not been the case since last August. Innovations that were\nsupposed to insulate consumers from credit supply problems have essentially done the\nopposite, making a credit crunch a concern for consumers as well as businesses.\nInitially, borrowers of subprime mortgages felt the largest impact. Because\ninvestors lost confidence in the securitization structure for subprime mortgages, investors\nvirtually abandoned the market, impeding the ability of borrowers to get subprime\nmortgages.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nBut so-called jumbo mortgages were also affected. While these mortgages were\noften to borrowers with good credit history, banks were no longer able to securitize these\nmortgages but were forced to hold the loans in their own portfolio. This resulted in the\nspread on jumbos rising, reflecting banks’ limited desire to expand their balance sheet on\nthese types of mortgages.\nInitially, the one area of the mortgage market that was only modestly impacted\nwas that for prime mortgages that could be securitized by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nHowever, this spring highlighted the financial problems at the two Government\nSponsored Enterprises (the GSEs) – problems which have both increased their borrowing\ncosts and reduced their willingness to expand their balance sheets.\nFigure 7 provides the 30-year conventional mortgage rate and the effective\nFederal Funds rate. During the previous two periods of significant monetary easing,\naround the times of the 1990 and 2001 recessions, the 30-year rate trended down when\nthe Federal Reserve was reducing the Federal Funds rate. This is in contrast to the\ncurrent period when, despite a significant decline in the Federal Funds rate, the 30-year\nconventional mortgage rate has remained little changed.\nFigure 8 shows the rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and\njumbo mortgages. Because one-year ARMs are frequently reset, their rates tend to be\nmuch more responsive to Federal Reserve rate easing than those of longer-term loans.\nWhile the yield on one-year ARMs did fall significantly in the previous two periods\nwhere the Federal Funds rate declined substantially, this time the yield on one-year\nARMs has been fairly unresponsive to the lower Federal Funds rate. While there is only\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\na limited time-series for rates on jumbo mortgages, those rates have increased\nsignificantly despite the lower Federal Funds rate.\nIn sum, the problems relating to the securitization market and the GSEs have\nreduced the responsiveness of mortgage and other consumer lending rates to reductions in\nthe Federal Funds rate. It is also a sign of the times that for many borrowers, access to\ncredit may be limited because of an unwillingness to lend to borrowers with troubled\ncredit histories, or because falling housing prices have reduced their ability to utilize\nhome equity lines of credit. Where credit is available, the yields have remained high\ndespite the reductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nThat is not to say that monetary policy has been ineffective – quite the opposite,\nin my view. The rate easing and liquidity measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve\nwere appropriate and effective, in that credit problems would likely be a great deal more\nsevere, and widespread, had we not taken the steps.\n\nIV. Implications for monetary policy\nNow a few additional thoughts on what this all means for U.S. monetary policy.\nWhile the Federal Funds rate is low by historical standards, I would argue that\none cannot capture the stance of monetary policy by only looking at this one rate,\nparticularly during a period when the transmission of monetary policy has been impeded\nby problems with securitization, financial institutions, and GSEs.\nDuring a credit crunch, various constraints on the supply of credit will make\nmarket rates less responsive to a lower Federal Funds rate. While the Federal Reserve\nessentially sets the Federal Funds rate (the rate at which banks will lend to each other), it\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndoes so with the intention of also impacting other rates that more directly affect\nborrowers. But in the current period, many business borrowers and consumers are\nfinding their access to credit has diminished, and their cost of credit has risen, despite the\nreductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nIndeed, as suggested earlier, the reductions in the Federal Funds rate have done\nlittle but offset some of the tightening occurring in the marketplace in response to the\ncredit crunch conditions. Thus one can argue that much of the easing in monetary policy\nto date has merely offset the tightening in credit conditions created by the financial\nturmoil that began last summer.\nIdeally, as these financial headwinds subside, the current very large spreads\nrelative to the Federal Funds rate will narrow, and we will see the rates available to\nbusinesses and consumers decline, helping to stimulate demand. It is precisely for this\nreason that the Federal Reserve has undertaken a variety of innovative liquidity measures,\nto enable the financial markets to begin to operate more normally.\nLet me conclude by reiterating my view that credit conditions, while difficult,\nwould likely be much worse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds\nrate and opened the additional liquidity facilities.\nIn closing let me thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today about\nthese important issues, and their implications – for all of us in the region and for the\nnational economy.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n2\n\nFor more on this topic see my comments on liquidity and systemic risk, delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond's 2008 Credit Markets Symposium (“The Changing Business\nof Banking”) in Charlotte, North Carolina on April 18, 2008 (available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/041808.htm).\n\n3\n\nOver the past year bank assets have actually grown, particularly at the largest institutions.\nMuch of this growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in\nresponse to liquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the\nfactors that have increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial\npaper, firms expanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were\noriginated with the expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing\nthe purchase of municipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being\nsecuritized. Swelling bank assets place pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull back in other\nareas.\n4\n\nFor a description of how leveraged institutions’ losses can have a disproportionate impact\nsee Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin. They have highlighted the importance of loss of\ncapital on highly leveraged broker-dealers (“Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the Mortgage\nMarket Meltdown” – U.S. Monetary Policy Forum Report No. 2; Rosenberg Institute, Brandeis\nInternational Business School and Initiative on Global Markets, University of Chicago Graduate\nSchool of Business (2008).\nSee also Adrian and Shin, “Financial Intermediaries, Financial Stability and Monetary\nPolicy” (paper prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Symposium at Jackson\nHole, August 2008).\n5\n\nIn essence “subprime” loans refer to mortgages that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. Subprime loans carry higher interest\nrates reflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in\nsubprime loans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime\nloans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking\nsubsidiaries.\n\n6\n\nFor a description of credit crunch problems in the early 1990s see Peek and Rosengren,\n\n“The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of Money, Credit and\n\nBanking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638.\n7\n\nSee for example Cara Lown and Don Morgan, “The Credit Cycle and the Business Cycle:\nNew Findings Using the Loan Officer Opinion Survey” in Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking\n38 (2006), pp. 1575-1597, for how the loan officer survey may be help predict trends in GDP\ncomponents that are bank dependent.

        "content": "EMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\n“Observations on Housing, Lending, and\nForeclosure Prevention”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nCitizens’ Housing and Planning Association (CHAPA)\n41st Annual Dinner and Meeting\nBoston Convention and Exhibition Center\n\nOctober 16, 2008\n\nI want to thank you for inviting me to join you this evening for the Citizens’\nHousing and Planning Association’s 41st Annual Dinner and Meeting. 1 And I want to\napplaud CHAPA for its longstanding, proactive commitment to affordable housing and\ncommunity development.\nI especially admire the ways in which you bring together and leverage the\ninterests of all parties with a stake in housing. This approach is no doubt challenging, but\nin it lie the roots of your success. As recent events in housing and financial markets have\nshown us, comprehensive solutions that engage many stakeholders can make for long\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\ndays, tough conversations, and complex negotiations – but can also make for workable\nsolutions that make a difference.\nLately I have had occasion to say that these are the times when you need a central\nbank. I would add tonight, in all sincerity, that these are times when you also need a\nCHAPA.\n\nAs you all know, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated recently,\nand while the housing and financial markets are most impacted, there is little doubt that\nthe effects are spilling over to the rest of the economy. However, now with appropriate\nand determined policy actions underway, I believe much of the spillover can be mitigated\nand the economy can return to growth that is closer to potential next year. To that end, I\nbelieve that policymakers should maintain a focus on three key areas, which I’ll mention\nbriefly.\n\nFirst, it is essential that liquidity for companies is maintained, or more\naccurately, is re-established. It is really in every citizen’s interest that firms –\nparticularly our most creditworthy ones – not face uncertainty over whether they will be\nable to continue to finance themselves with short-term debt. In fact, firms with top credit\nratings can be critical stabilizers during difficult times, as they should be in a position to\ncontinue to invest and ultimately help the economy maintain employment levels.\nIn this regard I am very pleased to point to recent steps policymakers have taken\nto restore well- functioning short-term credit markets. Actions taken include the\nestablishment by the Federal Reserve of liquidity facilities for money market funds,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nprimary dealers, and issuers of commercial paper; the U.S. Treasury’s recent steps such\nas providing temporary insurance for money market funds and the plan to invest capital\nin banks to free up lending; and the FDIC’s guarantee on senior debt and non-interestbearing transaction accounts of banks. 2\nIn a speech at the University of Wisconsin last week, 3 I spoke in some detail\nabout issues of liquidity and liquidity-risk concerns. But as we gather tonight, I can say\nthat I believe appropriate and powerful actions are now in process, so that while it will\ntake some time for markets to return to normal, problems should moderate going forward.\n\nMy second observation is that financial firms need to have the financial strength\nto continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers. Making sure that banks have sufficient\ncapital to continue to lend is vital, because access to credit is critical for households and\nbusinesses.\nThe policy actions taken earlier this week, building on those of recent months,\nshould insure that banks have sufficient capital to continue lending, preventing more\nsignificant problems. It is very likely that these policy actions will mitigate some of the\nproblems that have been rippling out from capital-constrained banks.\n\nMy third broad observation for policy focus involves the housing market – it\nneeds to reach bottom and potential homebuyers need to gain the confidence to return to\nthe market. By this I mean that individuals shopping for homes need to be confident that\nappropriate financing is available for home-ownership. Individuals need to be more\nconfident in housing transactions proceeding normally because institutions and markets\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nwith a role in such transactions are functioning well. And individuals need to feel that\nthere is the potential for housing prices to rise.\nIt is this third broad theme, concerning the housing market, which I would like to\nexpand upon this evening. I plan to offer a few thoughts on the background to current\nhousing problems, make some observations on the issue of connecting lenders with\nborrowers, share some early results from a large foreclosure-prevention event we helped\norganize at Gillette Stadium, and end with a few concluding remarks.\n\nI. Background on Current Housing Problems 4\nI’m sure most of you at a CHAPA event would agree that the causes of current\nhousing problems are complicated and multifaceted. Yet despite the complexity of the\nissues, there are some observers who look for easy answers. Some have focused on\nlenders and lax underwriting standards; others have focused on profligate borrowers.\nHowever, neither of these simple “black and white” explanations seems consistent\nwith the facts – including the reality that just over half of all recent (2006-2007)\nforeclosures in Massachusetts have been suffered by prime, not subprime, borrowers –\nborrowers that did not need lax underwriting standards to qualify, and who did not have\nundue leverage since they qualified as prime borrowers. 5\nThis is a good example of the complexity and nuance that surrounds the situation.\nSo the explanations that assign blame in only one corner seem to me to fall short. This is\nan important point, because if we misdiagnose the causes of the crisis, we could misdirect\nthe remedies.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nIn this regard, allow me to make just a brief comment on a matter of some debate\nin recent news reports and opinion pieces. Some, unfortunately, see the crisis and say\nthat regulators pushed lenders to extend bad loans in previously underserved areas. The\nBoston Fed’s position has long been – despite some determined mischaracterizations –\nthat some flexibility in underwriting criteria may be appropriate if the borrower’s\nwillingness and ability to handle the debt can be affirmed, and such flexibility is\nconsidered in a consistent and fair manner across applicants.\nWe have not, and do not, advocate for irresponsible or poorly underwritten\nlending. That perspective, however, is not at odds with advocating that the various\nparticipants in housing markets continue to strive for fair access to credit, appropriately\nextended. Nor is it at odds with our belief that responsibly underwritten loans to\nborrowers in low- and moderate-income areas – including those whose credit situation is\nconsidered “subprime” but can document their ability to afford the loan – are welcome\nand indeed crucial.\n\nTo return to my discussion of the present situation, I know that most of you here\ntonight are seeing the toll that foreclosures are taking – particularly in low-and-moderateincome and minority communities and areas like Dorchester, Lawrence, Chelsea, and\nWorcester. Such communities are bearing the brunt of foreclosures in terms of volumes\nand rates.\nI would like to make a few observations on foreclosures in general. Foreclosures\nare cyclical, meaning they are much more likely to occur when the economy is in a\ndownturn and when housing prices are declining. Slide 2 shows the delinquency rates for\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nresidential mortgages at New England financial institutions. Not surprisingly, the last\ntime that housing prices were falling and the unemployment rate was rising significantly,\nwe saw a significant number of delinquencies.\nTo expand on this I would add that foreclosures, with their extraordinary toll on\nindividuals, neighborhoods, and the broader housing market and economy 6 – not to\nmention the lender or investor in many cases – usually have two common threads. First,\nforeclosure is much more likely if house prices are declining, since when prices are rising\n(especially if rapidly) a homeowner whose situation sours can sell the house rather than\nsee the house foreclosed. 7 Second, studies attribute the majority of foreclosures to certain\nunfavorable “life events” such as divorce, a spike in out-of-pocket healthcare costs\nstemming from an illness or injury in the family, or a loss of a job or income stream.\nSome such events are more likely during a period of elevated and rising unemployment\nrates. Unfortunately, in the current environment we have been experiencing both a\ndecline in home prices and rising unemployment rates – conditions where we might\nexpect elevated foreclosures.\nSlide 3 shows that areas with the most significant declines in home prices, such as\nFlorida, Nevada, and California, are also areas that have experienced very significant\nrates of foreclosure. This is also true for states in the Midwest that have been particularly\nimpacted by the downturn in the auto industry.\nClearly, matters have been aggravated by developments for borrowers and lenders\nin the marketplace for home loans. 8 For borrowers, it became much more common to\nborrow with little or no money down. Such borrowing is more risky, and would be\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nexpected to result in more foreclosures during an economic downturn. In addition, lowor no-documentation loans expanded.\nIt has also become increasingly easy to refinance homes or take out a home equity\n(“piggyback”) loan 9 . In fact, many (about 70 percent) of the subprime foreclosures in\nMassachusetts came on homes that were originally purchased with prime loans – for\nmany of these loans, owners had refinanced into subprime mortgages before defaulting. 10\nThis suggests room for improvement in terms of informing and educating borrowers on\nthe risks of homeownership, borrowing, and various financing arrangements. I would\nadd, somewhat parenthetically, that in some markets many of the homes in foreclosure\nare investor-owned, or are second homes. 11\nSignificant innovations in mortgage lending occurred as the industry evolved –\nand some of these innovations have exacerbated recent problems. Mortgages that used to\nbe held at local banks are now frequently originated by mortgage companies that reach\nout to borrowers through brokers, and then sell the mortgage to be part of a security\nbacked by many mortgages. 12\nWhile some mortgage companies and brokers clearly acted in good faith, under\nsuch “originate to distribute” arrangements there was less direct incentive to insure that\nthe mortgage was a sustainable product for the borrower than, for instance, with a loan a\nbank planned to hold in its portfolio. Certainly concerns about reputation in some cases\nexerted discipline – especially in situations where brokers depend heavily on word-ofmouth to generate leads – but there were significant countervailing forces at work.\nLenders were rewarded for volume, and brokers were frequently rewarded for both\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nvolume and higher interest rates. Too often in the unregulated sector, brokers’ customers\nended up in loans with high fees and unsustainable terms.\nMany mortgage brokers had little or no regulatory oversight. Most of the\nsubprime lenders active in this state were not federally regulated depository institutions,\nand most have failed. 13 In short, there is a role for increasing the incentives for lenders,\nand those that broker loans, to place homebuyers in mortgages that they can sustain.\n\nII. Connecting Distressed Borrowers with their Lenders\nIn today’s mortgage environment, the continuing relationship with the borrower –\nthat is, the collecting of mortgage payments and the handling of delinquencies and\nforeclosures – is generally handled by servicing organizations under contract to the\nindividuals or entities investing in the securities that are backed by the mortgages.\nSometimes the same organizations are both loan originators and servicers. It is important\nto recognize that in their servicer capacity these organizations are still working for the\ninvestors.\nA persistent complaint among distressed borrowers has been their inability to\nreach informed representatives of the loan servicers, to discuss and resolve their payment\nproblems. 14 In many accounts, borrowers report repeated efforts to reach servicers’\nrepresentatives and describe the frustration of “bouncing around” a telephone maze\nwithout being able to reach someone with the information and authority to discuss their\nsituation. Interestingly, we also hear complaints from loan servicers as to how difficult it\nis to reach and engage troubled borrowers. They highlight repeated mailings to troubled\nborrowers and the difficulty in finding phone numbers to reach some borrowers.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nWhen home mortgages were held by local community banks, the banks were\noften in a position to know the borrower personally, and were well aware of how to\ncontact the borrower should payment problems emerge. But today, loans may be\noriginated by a broker who has no involvement with the borrower once the loan has\nclosed. Frequently the loan servicer is located in another part of the country.\nIn sum, while economists like me have tended to assume that borrowers have a\nstrong incentive to discuss their payments problems and the possible options for\nrenegotiating terms, and that lenders have a strong incentive to avoid costly foreclosures,\nin practice getting borrowers and lenders together has proved to be surprisingly difficult\n(see Slide 4).\nIt was this observation that led the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to want to\nhold a large, well-publicized foreclosure-prevention workshop. There are significant\neconomies of scale to such an event. Large events can draw representatives of all the\nmajor servicers (many of whom have to fly in), so borrowers are less likely to be\ndisappointed by their servicer not attending. There are also economies of scale in\nadvertising the event and using a large venue with easy access and adequate parking and\npublic transportation arrangements. Large events are also advantageous for the loan\nservicer, because they can reach a large number of their troubled borrowers in a particular\ngeographic location.\nFortunately, Robert Kraft, Josh Kraft, and the New England Patriots Charitable\nFoundation were willing to provide Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots\nfootball team, as the site for a major foreclosure-prevention event in August (see Slide 5).\nWe had a variety of other invaluable co-sponsors and supporters: the Hope Now Alliance\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nhelped bring in the loan servicers, and Neighborworks America helped bring in the\nhousing counselors, some of whom work for organizations affiliated with CHAPA and\nsome of whom may be here tonight. Many of your organizations helped us get the word\nout about the event. I want to thank everyone for working with us.\nOutreach to borrowers was critical. The loan servicers that participated sent\n27,000 letters to their borrowers in New England who were 60 days or more past due.\nThe Boston Fed sent out over 50,000 postcards (Slide 6) to borrowers who took out\nsubprime loans – developing the mailing list from publicly available information from the\nRegistry of Deeds that was compiled by the Warren Group. We simply encouraged the\nrecipients to consider attending the event if they would find it helpful to speak directly to\ntheir servicer, and to meet with a foreclosure prevention counselor if they chose. For\nadditional outreach, with the help of our co-sponsors we placed numerous radio\ninterviews and ads in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. In part we focused on areas with\nhigh incidence of foreclosures.\nThe event itself needed a big venue (Slide 7). We hosted 20 servicer\norganizations, which sent 80 loss-mitigation representatives. Most of them remained\nbusy until late into the night, well after the formal close. In addition, we had the vital\nparticipation of some 20 counseling agencies that sent 50 counselors and legal aid\nrepresentatives. They also worked tirelessly and stayed well after the close. In addition\nthere was a large contingent of volunteers from Neighborworks, Fannie Mae, and the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston who pitched in to help the event run quite smoothly,\nconsidering its complexity and size.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nIII. Preliminary Results\nThe event attracted over 4,000 members of the public, representing 2,167\nborrowers. While there was a significant wait to see some servicers, 60 percent of the\nsurveyed attendees took advantage of the counseling services while waiting. Some\nservicers had the capacity to make loan modifications on the spot, while others could\nonly collect information, assess the borrower’s situation in person, and get back to the\nborrower after the event.\nIf one assumed that the mortgage crisis was isolated to one demographic slice of\nthe country, the scene that day told a very different story. The borrowers who made the\ntrek to Gillette seemed to be from all walks of life, and all races and ethnicities. The\nscene was both poignant and illuminating. Notably, the first lot to fill up at the beginning\nof our event was the handicapped parking area. We saw people of all ages with health\nconcerns and physical ailments.\nIt is still too early to statistically analyze the ultimate, long-term impact of the\nevent for distressed borrowers, but there are some indicative results that I can share with\nyou this evening. Slide 8 shows the results we at the Boston Fed have compiled to date\nfor borrowers that attended. We signed up just under 400 of the borrowers that attended\nto be contacted for phone interviews, which we began conducting in the week following\nthe event. The initial results show that about 39 percent of the people were still waiting\nto hear definitively from the servicer, about 37 percent had been told that the servicer\nwould not make any adjustments, and about 24 percent had received some modification\nin their loan terms.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nFurthermore, where there was a modification, the type of adjustments varied (see\nSlide 9). Of those we surveyed who had their loan modified, 62 percent had a permanent\nreduction in their interest rate, 42 percent had a temporary reduction in their payment,\nand 6 percent had a reduction in principal. In addition, about half of these borrowers\nwere offered a repayment plan to make up for the late payments. By the way, it is worth\nnoting that the event occurred in the middle of August, before the terms of the new\n“Hope for Homeowners” (H4H) program were announced by the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) on October 1.\nWe are now re-contacting the borrowers (the 39 percent) who were waiting to\nhear from their servicer about possible loan modifications, and we very much hope that\nround of calls will show additional progress. Of course, we also need more time to pass\nbefore we can analyze whether people who attended the event, or people who received\nloan modifications as a result, experience a significantly lower rate of foreclosure than\nthose who did not attend.\nWe learned a lot with this event. We hope that at future events, more servicers\nwill have the ability to make decisions on the spot or soon after the event. We are eager\nto see the numbers of borrowers who are still waiting to hear from their servicer on a\npossible modification go down, and for those decisions to happen more quickly in the\nfuture. Also, we will be interested to see whether the newly passed legislation has an\neffect on the number of borrowers that qualify for permanent reductions in interest rate or\nchanges in principal, relative to what was experienced in August.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile it is too early for a full assessment of this one major foreclosure-prevention\nevent, we do know that 24 percent of the attendees we have surveyed already have had\nthe terms of their loan changed – and as we re-survey people, we hope that number will\ngo up. As servicers have become better staffed to work out problems with borrowers,\nand with new legislative initiatives and other policy developments, we hope that more\nconcrete actions can be taken sooner, thus avoiding preventable foreclosures.\nIt does appear that bringing borrowers together with servicers and counselors to\ndiscuss issues in person has significant advantages, and that large events reap certain\neconomies of scale. For these reasons the Boston Fed is looking to partner on one or\nmore large foreclosure-prevention events in the future. If we can line up a time and place\nthat are appropriate for another such event, we will be making an announcement.\nOf course, while foreclosure-prevention workshops appear to be helpful, ideally\nborrowers and lenders will not wait for these large events before initiating fruitful\ndiscussions. Ideally, with new legislative initiatives and the actions recently announced\nby the U.S. Treasury, more forceful actions will be taken by all participants –\nactions that in sum will help stabilize the housing market and benefit all its participants.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M.

In Florida and Nevada, there were many investor-owned properties, and\nthese areas have been particularly impacted by foreclosures.\n12\n\nMortgages were pooled and securitized, then split and re-sold onto the secondary market to\ninvestors. Servicing companies act as intermediaries between the borrowers – the person making\nthe monthly mortgage payment, and the ultimate investor. The securities are governed by\ncomplex pooling and servicing agreements that vary in terms of what they allow. This makes\nloan workouts much more complicated. Some allow for flexibility on modifications according to\nstandard servicer procedure, others place caps on the number of loans that can be modified, others\nstill explicitly forbid modifications.\n13\n\nSee the Table in my speech on “Subprime Mortgage Problems: Research, Opportunities, and\nPolicy Considerations” – available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2007/120307.htm.\n14\n\nAn informed and balanced description of these issues was offered in the testimony of Urban\nEdge’s Mossik Hacobian before the House Committee on Financial Services on September 17.\nThe testimony, at a hearing on “The Implementation of the Hope for Homeowners Program and\nA Review of Foreclosure Mitigation Efforts”, is available at\nhttp://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/hacobian091708.pdf\n\n15\n\n\fObservations on Housing, Lending,\nand Foreclosure Prevention\nEric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nICBI RiskMinds 2008 Conference:\nThe Global Risk Regulation Summit\n\nDecember 8, 2008\nGeneva, Switzerland\n\nI am very pleased to be with you today, as it is a particularly appropriate time for all of us\nto be at a conference focused on risk management and risk modeling for financial institutions. 1\nAs you know, many banks around the world have, of late, found themselves needing equity\ninfusions from governments, or expanded guarantees for their liabilities.\nA widespread need for banks’ recapitalization has occurred at least twice in the past\ncentury, and in many countries has occurred much more frequently than that. Many banks’ risk\nmodels were supposed to be calibrated for “once-in-a-thousand-years” events; however, these\nmodels seriously underestimated risk.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nCertainly there is much still to study and understand about the recent financial turmoil\nthat emerged in the summer of 2007. But it seems abundantly clear, and not all that surprising,\nthat risks calibrated from a few years of data from good times can dramatically under-estimate\nrisk exposure for a particular asset, as well as the high correlation of risks across asset classes\nduring periods of significant stress. Furthermore, while capital models were intended to suggest\nminimum capital requirements that would keep institutions sound during risky times, the models\nwere frequently used to justify expansion of dividends and stock buybacks, because they\nsuggested that banks were overcapitalized during boom times. So this conference occurs at a\ngood time, as we all try to re-evaluate how best to model and manage risk.\nAnd it is not only our risk models that need to be reevaluated. Our regulatory framework\nclearly needs to be reconsidered, in light of recent events. Both in the U.S. and globally, we had\nin place a complex set of regulations and supervisory structures intended, in part, to increase the\nlikelihood that financial intermediaries would remain well capitalized without government\nassistance. Like the risk models, bank regulators did not foresee the dramatic illiquidity that\ncould emerge during a period of acute financial turmoil – nor the changes in the value of assets\non balance sheets, or the degree of correlation of those asset values.\nWhile regulatory reform proposals are already beginning to surface, I see value in first\nevaluating the principles that should frame the discussion. Before we begin to work on\nregulatory details we need to evaluate whether the problem was poor execution of a wellconsidered regulatory framework, or that important principles were absent from the framework.\nWhile in my view the recent experience shows elements of both, I want to focus today on\nregulatory principles rather than their implementation.\nBut before discussing regulatory principles, I would like to briefly discuss our current\neconomic situation, in order to put the recent crises in context.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nRecent Economic Conditions\n\nMany countries have already experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP\ngrowth and the NBER has recently declared that the U.S. entered the recession at the end of last\nyear. In the U.S., GDP in the second quarter was positive, helped in part by a fiscal stimulus\npackage. In the third quarter, GDP declined by 0.5 percent, and it looks like in the fourth quarter\nit will decline somewhat more significantly – since consumer and investment spending appear to\nbe dropping quite precipitously. This is due, in part, to the interplay of developments in asset\nmarkets and the real economy. U.S. consumers – and, increasingly, consumers across Europe –\nhave been buffeted by declining housing prices and falling stock prices. The resulting loss of\nconsumer wealth, coupled with a rapidly rising unemployment rate, suggests the holiday buying\nseason will not be robust as was hoped earlier this year.\nThe likelihood of further weakening of labor markets, and a reluctance of consumers or\nbusinesses to increase spending until economic conditions are more certain, together imply a\ncontinued difficult environment for banks. There are several conditions necessary for financial\nmarkets to resume a more normal state, and I would like to briefly discuss each.\nFirst, we need short-term credit markets to return to normalcy. Conditions in short-term\ncredit markets have improved significantly since the end of September. As shown in Figure 1,\nrates in the market for high-grade financial commercial paper have resumed a more normal\nrelationship to the Federal Funds rate target, compared to the mid September to mid October\ntimeframe. This improvement in what was a very large spread has been greatly aided by the\nvarious short-term credit facilities established by the Federal Reserve to help reduce the stress in\nshort-term credit markets. These facilities have also enhanced the ability of financial firms and\nissuers of commercial paper to extend the maturities on commercial paper issues (see Figure 2),\nwhich at the end of September had become dependent on overnight financing. The facilities\nhave also reduced the risk that financing would not be available over the year end, as many\ncommercial-paper issuers have now financed themselves beyond that point. But despite these\nimprovements, short-term credit markets remain strained. Figure 3 shows that the spread\nbetween Libor 2 and the Overnight Index Swap rate has fallen from its late-September peak but\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nremains well above the level that prevailed prior to the outbreak of financial turmoil in summer\nof 2007.\nSecond, we need to see some improvement in the housing market before financial markets\nwill resume a more normal state. In the U.S., residential investment began declining in the first\nquarter of 2006 and has declined in each quarter since. And as Figure 4 shows, house prices\nhave declined nationally, and in some markets the declines have already exceeded 25 percent. A\nnumber of proposals have been floated to help stem foreclosures, but to date there has been\nrelatively modest progress – faced, as we are, by the dual problems of falling housing prices and\nrising unemployment. Stabilization in house prices and a drop in foreclosures would help the\noverall economy as well as the banking sector that is exposed to construction loans, residential\nmortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities.\nThird, officials must take into account – and develop policies and actions that reflect –\nthe degree to which monetary policy tools are currently deployed. The stance of U.S. monetary\npolicy reflects our rate reductions, with the Federal Funds rate target currently at 100 basis\npoints. Given that interest rates cannot be negative, further monetary-policy actions are limited\nby the zero lower bound for interest rates. While other monetary policy tools can be employed,\nincreasingly many observers and commentators are suggesting that fiscal stimulus will be an\nimportant element of economic recovery.\n\nPrinciples to Guide the Design of Regulatory Structure\n\nWith actions already taken to stabilize short-term credit conditions, and the widelyreported likelihood of further fiscal measures, I would hope that over the next year there can be a\nbroader discussion of lessons learned from our recent problems, and what measures can be taken\nto reduce the risk of a recurrence. There can sometimes be a tendency to move to proposals for\nregulatory design before building a consensus on the underlying principles that should guide the\ndebate. To that end, I would like to use my remaining time to discuss a few key principles that I\nhope will inform the many proposals that are likely to emerge.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 1:\nFinancial regulation must be more clearly focused on the key goal of macroeconomic stability\nas well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions.\nI lead with this principle, because I believe it has not necessarily received sufficient\nattention in our current regulatory structures. There is a clear link between the financial\nregulation of institutions and the stability of markets and the macroeconomy. Some countries\nhave had frequent and severe banking crises, while other countries have been much more\nsuccessful at weathering periods of international financial turmoil.\nOn the one hand, too conservative a regime of financial regulation can stymie innovation\nand creativity, thus preventing borrowers and lenders from interacting in the most efficient ways.\nOn the other hand, inadequate oversight can cause periods of financial turmoil that are quite\ndestructive to the financial infrastructure and the real economy. Future regulatory design must\nallow for innovation without increasing risks to the financial infrastructure and the real economy.\nPrinciple 2:\nBecause it is a key determinant of macroeconomic stability, systemic financial stability must\nreceive greater focus, with roles and responsibilities during a financial crisis more clearly\narticulated.\nRegulatory structures should be designed to minimize the probability of systemic\ndisruption or instability. In the future, the definition of a “systemically important” firm must be\nclear in advance, and the regulatory structure should be designed to minimize the chance that\nsuch firms will take actions that would put systemic stability at risk. In addition, should a crisis\narise despite the best efforts of regulators, the conditions and processes to “save” such firms must\nbe well understood in advance.\nImportantly, care must be given to the design of rescue options to minimize the incidence\nof moral hazard, or additional risk-taking by a party that is insured, “saved,” or otherwise\ninsulated from the consequences of its activities. Of course, the best way to avoid moral hazard\nis to avoid crisis situations in which organizations need “saving.” The next best way is to have\nwell-defined processes in place in advance, which minimize the effects of moral hazard. 3\nEssential to determining which institutions are systemically important is a comprehensive\nview of what you might call the “financial entanglements” – interdependencies – among\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M.

Recent experience indicates that the uncertainty around counterparty risk in nonexchange-traded transactions is significant during periods of market stress. And it is difficult to\nascertain the true extent of counterparty risk and whether a failure will result in significant\ndisruptions in markets where the financial institution serves as a key player.\nIn the U.S., the central bank can provide liquidity to the marketplace, but decisions to\ntake on credit risk that pose substantial risks to taxpayers should ideally be in the hands of the\nTreasury Department, with oversight by Congress. However, during this period of financial\nturmoil the Treasury Department did not have the pre-existing authority to intervene\nexpeditiously in such a crisis situation. The result was that the central bank became directly\ninvolved in urgent, time-sensitive issues that involved significant credit risk.\nTo be better prepared for systemic problems, “standing” fiscal and monetary facilities are\nneeded, to provide the ability to react more quickly than was possible of late. Until the passage\nof the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. Treasury Department did not have the\nability to react to emerging problems as quickly as it would have liked. Similarly, many of the\nFederal Reserve facilities required significant accounting, legal, and back-office infrastructure\nthat took some time to put in place.\nIn addition, as you all know, liquidity has been provided to institutions and markets\nwhere previously the central bank had little direct regulatory involvement. For example,\nfacilities that were needed to provide liquidity to investment banks and money-market funds\nwere established despite the absence of direct regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve at the\ntime the facility was initiated. Also, markets such as those for asset-backed commercial paper\nand unsecured commercial paper were not markets in which the Federal Reserve was actively\nengaged prior to the crisis. In the future, it would be ideal to clarify in advance which\ninstitutions and markets could require liquidity, and make sure the central bank has sufficient\ninformation about these institutions and markets to better serve in its role as lender of last resort.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 3:\nLiquidity risk must receive greater policy focus in determining regulatory structures.\nAt the outset of the recent financial turmoil, many observers assumed that liquidity risk\nwas well contained. In the case of investment banks, many of their assets were financed by\nrepurchase agreements – short-term loans that were fully collateralized. Because the repurchase\nagreements were collateralized, most parties assumed there was a relatively low risk of a “run”\nbecause the collateral could always be sold in the event of a default. However, concerns with\nvaluations of assets used for repurchase agreements resulted in many investors refusing to\ncontinue to lend even overnight once the counterparty was feared to be at risk of failure.\nIn addition, money market mutual funds were assumed to have relatively little liquidity\nrisk, because they were constrained by regulations that compel them to hold only investmentgrade securities of short duration. However, after one well-known money market mutual fund\nannounced that its investors would not be able to redeem their entire principal (“breaking the\nbuck”), many funds faced a wave of redemption requests they had great difficulty meeting – until\naction was taken to put in place temporary U.S. Treasury insurance as well as a new Federal\nReserve liquidity facility.\nThe financial turmoil has highlighted the reality that our regulatory structure had not fully\nanticipated the types of liquidity shocks that have occurred. Going forward, more attention\nshould be focused on ensuring that the causes of liquidity disruptions are better understood, and\nthat we are better equipped to avoid liquidity problems. 5\nAlso, we must be cognizant of an issue that has compounded these liquidity problems –\nthe interaction with accounting rules. Regulatory and accounting frameworks need to consider\nhow best to address periods of sustained illiquidity.\nIn order to prevent bank runs, many countries have not only insured bank deposits but\nhave also guaranteed other liabilities. We need to better understand how best to structure\nliabilities to avoid the need for such debt guarantees in the future. In the recent turmoil, for\nmany institutions it was the unexpected lack of a stable and fluid market for short-term debt to\nfinance their balance sheets that created liquidity problems. 6\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 4:\nCareful thought must be given to coordinating the work of the various domestic and\ninternational regulators in the design of the regulatory structure.\nIn the United States there exists a patchwork of overlapping regulators. Much of our\nregulatory design results from reactions to the Great Depression. Given all the changes that have\noccurred since then, it is probably appropriate to take a fresh look at our regulatory structure –\nnot just the bank-regulatory agencies but also the inter-relationship of their work with that of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nIdeally, a new structure would minimize the adverse effects of competing regulatory\ngoals. It will also need to consider how different regulatory bodies can be better coordinated so\nthat information moves more freely between them. Also, international coordination is becoming\nmuch more important, as firms have become more global. And as with monetary policy, I\nbelieve that to the extent possible, creating independent regulatory agencies with clear mandates\nis critical to success.\n\nPrinciple 5:\nResponsibility for strengthening market infrastructure should receive more attention in\nregulatory design.\nThe current crisis has highlighted the need for better transparency. If every transaction is\nunique, it becomes difficult to determine valuations during periods of illiquidity. To the extent\npossible, contracts governing securitization should be standardized, with clearly defined steps to\nresolve competing interests when the underlying assets lose value.\nSimilarly, contracts between institutions provide less transparency than transactions\nthrough exchanges. Exchange-traded assets provide a price that is widely observable – on\ncontracts for assets that are clearly defined. To the extent that more assets move to be exchangetraded, counterparty risk is reduced, and transparency is increased.\nI also believe that payment and settlement activities need greater oversight. The backoffice difficulties involved in unwinding complex trades that were not exchange-traded highlight\nthe need for more attention to settlement activities.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nConclusion\n\nOf course, these five principles are not the only ones of import. Others may stress other\nvery worthy points taken from the lessons of the recent episode. For example that financial\nregulation must be grounded in an understanding of institutional relationships – “real world”\ndetails, which clearly do matter. Or, as I mentioned when discussing moral hazard, that financial\nregulation needs to do a better job of recognizing the role of incentives. For example,\ncompensation structures affect actions – as is evident in situations where short-term risk-taking is\nrewarded very lucratively and losses are not borne by the originators of the risk.\nThe current crisis provides the opportunity and impetus to reexamine a regulatory\nframework that originated in the Great Depression. While I believe there is a clear need to\nredesign the current regulatory structure, it is important that we not lose important features of the\ncurrent market. It is critical that any regulatory design not stifle the industry’s innovation and\ncreativity. However, the regulatory structure needs to be more adaptable to innovations – in\norder to ensure that new safety and soundness, and systemic, concerns are not ignored. And it\nneeds to be aware of the details of the evolving financial-market structure.\nAdditional regulations do run the risk of moral hazard where the presence of a safety net\ncreates an incentive to take additional risk. While any countercyclical monetary, fiscal, or\nregulatory policy runs this risk, it should be minimized. Ideally, situations requiring public\nsupport should occur only after losses have been borne by equity holders, and existing\nmanagement and directors have been held responsible for the losses.\nTo the extent a new regulatory structure reduces counterparty risk, or requires offsets in\ncapital for transactions involving significant counterparty risk, the likelihood of spillover effects\nfrom one firm’s failure should be significantly reduced. Ideally a new structure will reduce the\nlikelihood of future financial turmoil of the length and severity of current financial problems.\nThank you for having me join you today, and thank you for the opportunity to share my\nviews on principles to guide the redesign of U.S. financial regulation.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M.

In such cases, intervention is necessary to protect the public interest. The problems of moral\nhazard and the existence of institutions that are 'too big to fail' must certainly be addressed, but the\nright way to do this is through regulatory changes, improvements in the financial infrastructure, and\nother measures that will prevent a situation like this from recurring. Going forward, reforming the\nsystem to enhance stability and address the problem of 'too big to fail' should be a top priority for\nlawmakers and regulators.\" The Chairman’s speech, Federal Reserve Policies in the Financial\nCrisis, is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm.\n\n4\n\nI discussed the benefits that central bank policymakers gain from having supervisory roles and\nrelationships in a speech in Seoul in March. “Bank Supervision and Central Banking: Understanding\nCredit During a Time of Financial Turmoil” is available on the Boston Fed’s website at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/032708.htm\n\n5\n\nFor more on issues of liquidity, liquidity-risk concerns, and systemic risk, see speeches entitled\n“Liquidity and Systemic Risk” and “The Impact of Financial Institutions and Financial Markets on\nthe Real Economy: Implications of a Liquidity Lock’”, available on the Boston Fed’s website at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/041808.htm and\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm, respectively.\n\n6\n\nSome observe that another lesson of the recent turmoil involves possible over-reliance on short-term\ndebt throughout the financial system.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 1\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate and\nthe Federal Funds Target Rate\nJuly 1, 2008 - November 28, 2008\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 2\nCommercial Paper Issuance\nJuly 2, 2007 – November 28, 2008\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 3\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - November 28, 2008\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 4\nS&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices:\nComposite and Selected Metropolitan Areas\nJanuary 2001 - September 2008\n\nSource: S&P/Case-Shiller / Haver Analytics\n\n\fPrinciple 1\nFinancial regulation must be more clearly\nfocused on the key goal of macroeconomic\nstability as well as the safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions.\n\n\fPrinciple 2\nBecause it is a key determinant of macroeconomic\nstability, systemic financial stability must receive greater\nfocus, with roles and responsibilities during a financial\ncrisis more clearly articulated.\n The definition of “systemically important” firms must be clear\nex ante, and the conditions and processes for “saving” such\nfirms must be apparent.
