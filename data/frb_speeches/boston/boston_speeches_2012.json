Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSmall Business Funding\nand the Economic Recovery\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConnecticut Business & Industry Association\nand MetroHartford Alliance\n“Economic Summit & Outlook 2012”\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 6, 2012\n\nI appreciate the invitation to speak today at the Connecticut Business and Industry\nAssociation. It strikes me that the timing of this gathering is particularly appropriate, in\nthat discussions of the economy – at least over the last few years – have not fueled any\nholiday cheer, but have been relevant to hopeful New Year’s resolutions.\nWhen I joined you at this event two years ago, I reviewed some of the patterns we\nsee in labor markets, and in particular industries, during early stages of recoveries. I\nnoted the forces making it likely that gains in employment would be slow in this\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrecovery. I wish I could say I was too pessimistic that day, but as we all know the\nrecovery has been painfully slow.\nToday, after a brief overview of some recent economic trends I would like to\nfocus on some key financial data. In particular, I want to highlight a distinctive feature of\nthe recent recession and the anemic recovery – the fact that financial-market problems\nhad a disproportionate effect on the length and severity of the recession and have been a\ncomplicating factor in the lack of strength in the recovery.\nI would like to walk you through a number of charts that lay out the situation –\nparticularly as it relates to small business financing. My “punch line” is that as\nchallenging as the financial headwinds to recovery have been, there are still policy\noptions to consider and explore that could make a difference, and I will mention a few\npossibilities.\nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nFirst, I’ll touch on the economic trends. I would say the economic data have been\nimproving somewhat, relative to what we were seeing in the summer. Various supply\nshocks that buffeted the world economy in the first half of 2011 are receding, as are the\nincreases in a variety of commodity prices. In part, these reversals reflect expected\neconomic weakness in other parts of the world.\nAs Figure 1 shows, a number of prices that were increasing in the first half of\n2011 (in blue) have moderated more recently (in red) – particularly energy prices and\nothers closely tied to energy, like airline fares, and also food and beverage prices. In\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\naddition to these data, I see no evidence of significant acceleration in labor costs – as a\nresult of weakness in labor markets – and also see reversals in a number of important\ncommodity price increases. As a result, I personally expect that inflation is likely to be\nbelow 2 percent not only in 2012 but also over the next several years.\nWhile the difficult conditions in labor markets are a reason inflation has been well\ncontained, the very weak job growth the country has experienced is of course itself a\ncritical problem. Figure 2 highlights the fact that many people are working part-time but\nwould prefer to work full time. The percent rose quickly during the recession (the shaded\nportion of the chart) and has stayed high. While these workers are currently employed,\nthis chart suggests that demand in the economy is not sufficiently strong for firms to\nemploy more workers full time. Labor demand simply remains too weak.\nWith inflation expected to remain below 2 percent, and unemployment and\nunderemployment so high, I believe it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue\nconsidering ways to promote stronger growth and hasten what is a painfully long, slow\nrecovery and adjustment time in the economy.\nAs a case in point, Figure 3 shows that households are now spending a lower\npercentage of their disposable income on debt-service payments, compared to just before\nthe onset of the recession when the ratio peaked at about 14 percent. While some of this\ndecline reflects unfortunate trends, such as defaults on mortgages, it also reflects the very\nlow interest-rate environment – which gives households an opportunity to improve their\nrelative financial condition1 (the net of their assets and liabilities) as less money is spent\non interest payments for mortgages and credit cards.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs an aside, I have emphasized in other talks that I think more can be done to\nfacilitate this process of adjustment – including tweaks to Government Sponsored\nEnterprise (GSE) mortgage programs and, potentially, expanding the purchase of\nmortgages by the Federal Reserve to keep mortgage rates low during a time of great\ndifficulty in housing markets.\nIn sum, I would say that the monetary policy actions already taken by the Federal\nReserve are allowing firms and households to speed up the adjustment process, and as\nsuch are laying the foundation for a stronger economy.\n\nEmployment Patterns\nNow I’d like to share some additional perspectives, informed by data. Figure 4\nshows the path of employment from its peak prior to the last four recessions. You see\nthat in the most recent recession and recovery, the decline from peak employment was\nmore severe and more lasting than in the previous three. Although we have experienced\nsome modest improvement in employment recently, we are nowhere near a return to the\npeak level of employment, which had occurred in the prior three recoveries by this point\nin time. The current recovery’s slow employment growth is, it goes without saying,\nworth examining in more detail.\nFigure 5 shows the net change in private sector employment, in thousands of\njobs, taking into account the size of the firm where the job gains or losses occurred. A\nclose look makes apparent that there are some significant differences over time. In the\n2001 recession the biggest employment declines were at the largest firms (shown in the\ngreen sections of each bar). During the recovery from the 2001 recession, firms with less\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthan 50 employees bounced back relatively quickly (the blue sections of each bar). But\nthe 2001 experience contrasts sharply with the recent recession, when the net decline was\nmuch more severe across all three firm-size categories.\nParticularly striking, however, is how much of a decline occurred for the smallest\nfirms employing less than 50 employees. Not only was the recession particularly severe\nfor small-firm employment, but employment growth during the recovery been slow at\nsmall firms.\nIn short, the experience of small firms is an important factor in the decline in\noverall employment during the most recent recession – and in the tepid employment\ngrowth in the recovery.\nFigure 6 highlights that in any dynamic recovery an economy experiences large\nflows of job gains and losses – but in this recovery the smallest and largest firms (on the\nextreme left and right of the chart) account for the most significant net job decline. The\nonly significant net gain (those slivers of green above the zero bound) is found in the\nmid-sized firm categories – those with more than 50 but less than 1,000 employees.\nThis pattern is quite different from the recovery that occurred after the 2001\nrecession, as shown in Figure 7 (the red bars). During that recovery, small firms (on the\nleft side of the chart) were an important source of net job gains, while larger firms (in the\ncenter and to the right) continued to be major sources of net job losses – consistent with\nthe overall slow improvement in employment during that recovery. In contrast, during\nthis recovery (the blue bars) the smallest firms have produced net job losses. The largest\nfirms have also accounted for job losses, but to a lesser degree compared to the prior\nrecovery.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne of the distinctive features of this recession has been the substantial decline in\nhousehold net worth, particularly resulting from the decline in real estate values. During\nrecessions that include sizable job losses, some people use difficult labor markets as their\nimpetus to start a small business. Such efforts have often been financed through home\nequity loans, which tend to be the lowest-cost type of financing available, especially\ncompared to the much more expensive use of credit cards.\nHowever, the ability to start a small business in this way has been severely\nhampered by the decline in house values and the tightening of credit standards. These\nfactors have made the traditional sources of entrepreneurial financing much less readily\navailable.\nIn addition, some of the states that saw the most dramatic declines in real estate\nvalues have also seen particularly high unemployment rates. As Figure 8 shows, the socalled “sand states” such as California, Nevada, and Florida have unemployment rates\nmuch higher than the U.S. average, and have also experienced sharp declines in\nresidential real estate values – declines much larger than the U.S. average. As a result,\nunemployed workers in these states are unlikely to have home equity available for\nfinancing a startup small business that could provide alternate employment.\nIn sum, these data suggest a very concerning dynamic. My sense is that in areas\nwhere high levels of unemployment might otherwise lead individuals to use home-equity\nfinancing or credit cards to start a business, today many find access to such forms of\ncredit impeded by impaired credit scores and the disappearance of home equity, given\ndepressed home values.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nPatterns in Bank Financing\nFigure 9 shows how the composition of business loans (at commercial and\nsavings banks) has changed over the past decade. There has been a significant increase in\nlarge commercial real estate loans, while small commercial and industrial (C&I) loans\nand small commercial real estate loans are now accounting for a lower share of the total.\nRelative to ten years ago, small-business loans account for a smaller percentage of overall\nbusiness loans.\nOver the past year we have seen only moderate growth in gross domestic product\n(GDP), and some hiring from the larger mid-sized firms. Figure 10 shows that lending\ndata are consistent with this pattern. Large C&I loans have recently been increasing, and\nlarge commercial real estate loans have remained relatively flat, but small C&I and small\ncommercial real estate loans have declined.\nTo me, the pattern is even more striking when you break up the composition of\nloans by the size of the bank, as shown in Figure 11. While small-business lending (in\nblue) has decreased across all bank sizes, the decline has been particularly striking at the\nlarger banks, shown on the left, where you see a substantial decline in small business\nloans. Banks of all sizes have increased their lending for large business loans (in red),\nwith the biggest percentage increase occurring at the smallest banks. In part this reflects\nthe fact that many of the smaller banks remain very well capitalized, and some mid-sized\nfirms have decided to shift their banking relationships from large banks to more\ncommunity-based banks (as more community-based banks compete for that business).\nFigure 12 shows the creation of new establishments. Given what I have\ndescribed so far, it is unfortunate but not surprising that the “birth rate” of new\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nestablishments declined sharply and remains below historical levels. Starting businesses\nwith financing from home equity or credit cards has become more difficult, and getting\nsmall business loans without some form of collateral remains quite challenging. While\ndemand for small business credit from qualified seekers surely plays a role, my sense is\nthat at least one reason for slow job creation in this tepid recovery may be that obtaining\nfinancing for new firms has become more difficult. And this suggests one reason why\nrecoveries after financial crises are particularly slow.\n\nImpact on the Outlook and Policymaking\nRecently the economic data has been somewhat more positive concerning the\nfourth quarter, but most forecasters do not, unfortunately, expect that momentum to carry\nthrough 2012. Most forecasters expect that economic growth in 2012 will be between 2\nto 3 percent, with the outlook gradually improving over the course of the year.\nUnfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar, which is consistent with only a very\ngradual improvement in labor markets.\nAllow me to briefly summarize my thinking.\nRecessions accompanied by significant financial problems tend to be more severe\ndownturns, followed by relatively slow recoveries. One reason for a slow recovery is that\nthe financial condition of households and firms – their “balance sheets,” given their\nliabilities and assets – take time to recover, and credit for borrowers with financial\nimpairments becomes more difficult to obtain. This is currently reflected in both\nlingering problems with residential real estate and with the difficulties related to small\nbusiness creation that I’ve described today.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nLet me touch briefly on residential real estate. It continues to be impacted by high\nforeclosures, falling housing prices in some areas, and tightened credit standards. I have\nnoted in prior talks that residential real estate tends to grow rapidly in the early stages of\na recovery, but not this time. Policymakers have pursued a variety of fiscal and monetary\napproaches to help with a housing recovery, and there have been recent suggestions\naround what more can be done.2\nIn terms of monetary policy, actions the Fed has taken to reduce long-term\ninterest rates are supportive of housing, and the Fed’s purchases of mortgage-backed\nsecurities provided an even more targeted approach to stimulating housing. Further\npurchases of mortgage-backed securities would in my view help provide a more rapid\nrecovery in housing, by reducing the costs of refinancing or purchasing new homes. Of\ncourse, these Fed actions would be even more effective if accompanied by fiscal policies\ndesigned to speed the recovery in housing.\nAs I have highlighted today, some of the slow employment growth we see is\nassociated with a less robust small business sector. The charts I shared show that loan\noriginations to small businesses have been quite weak, and that smaller firms have not\npushed the improvement in employment that we saw after the last recession. (I would\nnote that these points are amplified and more formally addressed in a Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston working paper by Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga.3).\nThis is a very serious challenge to the recovery and to the economy. As such,\npolicymakers must in my opinion explore all possible remedies, and weigh the costs and\nbenefits of each.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile many of the problems in this sector reflect impaired financials for many\nsmall businesses, and inadequate demand for products, I would add that credit availability\nfor creating or expanding small businesses can be quite a challenge. Again, monetary\npolicies that push down longer-term rates can be helpful, and that would be particularly\ntrue if there could be a targeted approach to improve small business financing. As with\nhousing, such monetary policies would be most effective if pursued in conjunction with\nfiscal policies targeted to improving conditions for small business.\nActions taken to date highlight that these problems are not easy to resolve. This,\nto my thinking, only underlines the need to look for creative policy solutions targeted to\nboth housing and small business.\nIn addition to these tangible problems, there remain of course significant\ndownside risks that are likely to make households and businesses cautious. Problems\nwith a slowing European economy, and sovereign and banking issues in Europe, remain\ndownside risks. Excessive fiscal austerity here or abroad also has the potential for near\nterm downside risk. Finally, recent uncertainty in the Middle East highlights the everpresent risk of potential oil shocks. Of course monetary policy has no direct influence on\nany of these risks. But they highlight the importance of finding ways to hasten the pace\nof economic growth and job creation at this point in time.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I know I don’t need to tell you that we continue to\nhave a slow recovery. We all know, as well, that issues of some concern exist in Europe\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand elsewhere. I would reiterate that one reason for the tepid pace of recovery is that\nfinancial problems and restraints continue to have lingering effects on the economy.\nToday I have focused on one of those lingering problems, the impairment of\nhousehold financial condition that has made new business formation particularly difficult.\nGiven the low inflation rate and weak labor markets that are both likely to persist this\nyear, I believe the Federal Reserve should continue to explore ways to promote more\nrapid recovery through stronger growth.\nThe Federal Reserve has a variety of tools to consider as we try to promote faster\neconomic growth – including communicating in different ways the likely future path of\nthe economy and the implications for interest-rate policy (as was mentioned in FOMC\nminutes released this week), and considering additional large-scale asset purchases.\nIn addition, I believe that policymakers can and should continue to look at ways\nto better target fiscal and monetary policy to address the housing and small business\nfinancing problems we are seeing in this recovery. I believe that the continuing\ndifficulties compel us to think creatively and proactively about ways to return the\neconomy to full employment. I hope today I have stimulated some thinking about the\npossible policy remedies.\nThank you for having me join you today, and despite these challenging economic\ntimes let me extend my best wishes for the coming year to each of you and to every New\nEnglander.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\ni.e., the household “balance sheet.”\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the National Institute\nof Economic and Social Research\nLondon, England\nMarch 27, 2012\n\nGood evening. I would like to thank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research\nfor hosting this event. Given the economic and financial shocks that have buffeted the global\neconomy in recent years, I think it is particularly important to share perspectives across the Atlantic –\non the economic outlook, but also on the risks to both the outlook and financial stability.\nI am honored to be sharing the stage with Adam Posen. I have long admired Adam’s\nacademic work and policy perspectives, and I am looking forward to discussions with Adam and his\ncolleagues at the Bank of England over the next several days.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nToday I would like to begin with a discussion of emerging economic trends in the United\nStates, and then move into a discussion about opportunities to bolster stability in our financial\ninfrastructure. My theme throughout is the need to avoid complacency.\nRecently released statistics are consistent with improved financial market conditions and\ncontinued – albeit painfully slow – progress in labor markets. At the same time, the spending data\nhave been very weak. How should we reconcile these differences?\nFocusing only on financial and labor market conditions, one might conclude that the recovery\nis undeniably gaining traction – and that spending will improve as higher personal income and wealth\ncontribute to a reinforcing cycle that propels us toward full employment in the U.S. Alternatively,\nfocusing only on the weak spending data might lead one to conclude that the improvements in labor\nmarkets and financial conditions are going to prove temporary, because the recent improvements are\nprobably unsustainable if the U.S. economy continues to grow at only a 2 percent rate.\nIt may take several quarters before we know which of these two perspectives is actually better\nreflective of the U.S. economy today.\nBeyond discussing the economic outlook in the United States, I would like to make a few\nobservations on financial markets. I’ll state my firm view that the actions taken by central banks\naround the world – for example, engaging in foreign exchange swap line agreements and using less\ntraditional monetary policy tools – have been both appropriate and necessary.\nHowever, many of these actions were ultimately necessary because supervisory and regulatory\nframeworks were not sufficiently macro-prudential. By macro-prudential I am referring to a focus on\nrisks, vulnerabilities, or dependencies that potentially could affect the financial system as a whole –\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nversus just the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Ideally, central banks should not need\nto take actions to support continued financial intermediation, because financial institutions should be\nsufficiently resilient to ensure that even unusual financial-market stress would not impair effective\nintermediation. Recent events have highlighted that we remain far from achieving that goal.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me begin with some thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook.\nThere have been positive trends in some recent economic data. U.S. financial market\nconditions are clearly improving. Some of the recent improvements reflect the moderation or removal\nof some significant, imminent, downside “tail” risks. At least for now, Europe seems to have avoided\nthe risk of a so-called “Lehman moment” – a risk that had seriously concerned investors.\nThe S&P 500 has risen roughly 9 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure\n1. Risk gauges, such as spreads on bonds and credit default swaps (CDSs), have improved. Bond\nissuance has been strong. U.S. financial markets have gathered steam and reflect increased optimism\nabout likely economic outcomes.\nHowever, my enthusiasm is tempered by the challenges still facing Europe.\nForward-looking financial markets seem to be pricing in improved economic outcomes, and\nthere are some brightening signs, to be sure. Figure 1 shows that auto sales in the United States have\nrebounded nicely, and consumer sentiment has improved significantly since last August. In addition,\npayroll employment in the U.S. has been growing at a rate of 245,000 jobs a month over the past three\nmonths. This should mean more disposable income, which coupled with increasing household wealth\n(fueled by stock market gains), should be consistent with an improved outlook for spending.\nHowever, when we focus solely on the incoming spending data, the outlook appears less\nrobust. Since the start of the recovery, what we call real final sales – that is, domestically produced\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ngoods and services (net of inventories, which can swing significantly from quarter to quarter) – have\nbeen growing at only 1.7 percent, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, my forecast for the first quarter\nof this year would be for real final sales to grow at roughly 2 percent, only slightly better than the\naverage during the U.S. recovery to date.\nFigure 3 highlights two distinctive features of this recovery – unusually weak residential\ninvestment, despite very low interest rates; and an extended decline in state and local government\nspending.\nThe health of the U.S. housing market has been hampered by significant declines in housing\nprices, very elevated foreclosures, and a large inventory of vacant homes. As a result, residential\ninvestment – which normally grows quite rapidly during a recovery – has not provided its customary\noverall boost to the economic recovery. While some tentative signs of an improving housing sector\nhave emerged, for the reasons I just mentioned it is likely to be subdued relative to historical\nexperience.\nAlso, state and local government spending has been unusually weak during this recovery. The\nseverity of the recession, combined with the fall in home values that are the basis for many local\ngovernment tax revenues, have forced substantial cuts in state and local spending. It is worth noting\nthat in the U.S., state and local government spending accounts for a larger share of GDP than does\nfederal government spending: 11.7 percent of GDP, compared to 8.0 percent for federal spending.\nState and local budgets will remain under stress as governments face increasing demands on\ntheir resources, such as addressing significant shortfalls in certain areas (for example employee\npensions). At the same time, federal government spending is expected to be cut significantly, making\ngovernment spending as a component of GDP a challenging aspect of the economic outlook in the\nUnited States.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nSo, despite some good production data and the optimism seen in financial markets, the\nspending data are consistent with real U.S. GDP growth over the course of 2012 of only 2.5 percent –\nwhich unfortunately is only fast enough to make modest headway at reducing the unemployment in\nour labor market.\nGiven the very modest recovery to date, it is surprising that the unemployment rate, depicted\nin the recent downward trend in the line in Figure 4, has shown as much improvement as it has. The\ncurrent unemployment rate of 8.3 percent represents a decline from 9.1 percent over the past six\nmonths, despite only modest growth in spending.\nHowever, while the unemployment rate has declined, there has not been much improvement in\nthe important ratio of employment to population, shown in Figure 5.\nOf course aggregate employment-to-population ratios are impacted by demographic changes –\nfor example the aging of the “baby boom” generation in the U.S. To explore the role that recent\ndemographic changes might have played on the movement of the employment-to-population series,\nFigure 6 shows the same concept for particular age cohorts that are less likely to be impacted by\ndemographics over the short term. The employment-to-population ratio in age groups where the\nattachment to working should not have changed shows a pattern very similar to that of the ratio as a\nwhole.\nSo part of the decline in the unemployment rate is resulting from workers leaving the labor\nforce. Furthermore, only in recent months has the employment-to-population ratio improved and the\npayroll employment growth clearly exceeded the normal growth rate of the labor force. So the U.S.\nremains well below the employment levels that would be viewed as consistent with the maximum\nsustainable employment aspect of the Federal Reserve’s so-called dual mandate.\nThe other element of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is inflation. Figure 7 charts two\nprimary measures of inflation – total personal consumption expenditure inflation, and core personal\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nconsumption expenditure inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy categories). Core\nPCE inflation – again excluding food and energy – has remained below the Federal Reserve target of\n2 percent throughout the recovery. Total PCE inflation, including food and energy, is slightly above 2\npercent, but has diverged from core prices when commodity prices such as oil have spiked up or\ndeclined substantially. As the figure shows, however, the more volatile total measure tends over time\nto revert to the level of core inflation.\nWith the recent spike in oil prices, it is likely that total PCE inflation will rise further, but this\nincrease is likely to be temporary, reflecting volatile oil price movements. For 2013 my own forecast\nis for both total PCE and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent, although this forecast assumes that\nMiddle East tensions do not result in another sharp spike in oil prices.\nAnother potential inflationary concern has been raised by the swelling of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet that occurred as we purchased assets to advance monetary policy goals. But\nFigure 8 shows that commercial real estate lending is still declining – and while commercial and\nindustrial lending has increased, it has yet to return to its level at the beginning of the recession. What\nthis means it that by and large, the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet has not turned into a\nsignificant increase in the supply of money, because banks have not been lending out their holdings of\nexcess reserves. So the expansion of reserves that occurred in 2008 as the Fed expanded its balance\nsheet has not been inflationary, given the subdued bank lending environment.\nIndeed, bank lending has been quite modest despite a relatively rapid improvement in bank\ncapital ratios in the United States. This should give some European analysts pause, as the experience\nin the U.S. (as well as the earlier Japanese experience) suggests that the constraints on bank lending\ndue to the recent financial problems in Europe may be more long-lasting than some are expecting.\nIn summary, while recent financial-market and labor-market data in the U.S. have been\nencouraging, spending data remain disappointing. Like many forecasters, I expect higher real GDP\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ngrowth as the year progresses. But I would caution that I and many others held a similar view at the\nbeginning of 2010 and 2011.\nIf real GDP does not grow more rapidly and unemployment remains at its current\nunacceptably high level, monetary policy may need to be more accommodative. The U.S.\nunemployment rate remains well above a level that could be considered full employment, while we\nare likely to undershoot our inflation targets. Together these factors provide room for flexibility in\nthe response of monetary policy as we receive additional information on current economic conditions.\n\nChallenges in Bank Funding\nDespite the improvements we are seeing in the U.S. economy, a number of significant risks\nand challenges remain. One involves geo-political risks, which have already caused oil prices to rise\nmore than most non-energy commodity prices. Any further significant increase in energy prices\nwould be an additional impediment to faster growth. Another involves the unsustainable budget\ndeficits that many countries, including the United States, currently have. The challenge, I believe, is\nthat greater fiscal responsibility must be implemented in a way that does not threaten tentative\neconomic recoveries. A third risk is the continued fragility in our financial infrastructure – a situation\nthat can substantially amplify other economic problems. It is this third risk that I would like to touch\nupon today.\nThe economic slowdown that began in the United States several years ago went from being a\nmild event led by housing-related problems to being a much more severe and long-lasting economic\ndownturn. This was, in part, because of the architecture of the financial sector.1 Today I would like\nto highlight one particular potential structural flaw in the financial architecture – the dependence on\nshort-term funding.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThis past financial crisis was a primer on vulnerabilities to short-term funding. Specifically,\nwholesale funding utilized by large global banks dried up during the financial crisis. As large banks\nsought to reduce their exposure to counterparties of concern, the term of loans made in the\nmarketplace decreased, and the cost of short-term credit spiked.\nAnd many of the problems were occurring outside of traditional depository institutions. Bear\nStearns and Lehman Brothers were investment banks, not commercial banks. As counterparties\ndramatically reduced both unsecured and secured lending to these two entities, funding was no longer\navailable and the firms failed.\nSimilarly, money market mutual funds with exposures to investment banks in many cases\nrequired support from parent or sponsoring entities. And one fund without parental support – the\nReserve Primary Fund – sustained a credit loss that would ultimately lead to its liquidation. This led\nto a run on prime funds, which in turn further impaired short-term credit markets.\nAs Figure 9 shows, the money market mutual fund industry held $3.5 trillion in assets under\nmanagement in mid September 2008. Prime funds, which hold a mix of Treasury and agency\nsecurities and other short-term debt instruments (including commercial paper and large certificates of\ndeposit), held nearly 60 percent of industry assets, or $2.1 trillion.\nWhen the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck,” outflows from prime funds totaled roughly\n$500 billion over a four-week period. Although much of the outflow went into government money\nmarket mutual funds (which hold only Treasury and agency securities, and repurchase agreements\nbacked by such securities), these inflows did little to ease the strains being felt in the corporate\nfunding markets resulting from the exit from prime funds.2\nU.S. money market funds are thought of and marketed as highly liquid, low-risk investments\nwith many of the same characteristics as traditional bank deposits. As a result, money market fund\ninvestors and money market fund managers should be highly sensitive to changes in underlying risks.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThe crisis in autumn of 2008 taught us that safeguarding against runs on financial entities like money\nmarket funds – entities that do not have a large, stable, core deposit base and do not have ordinary\naccess to the central bank’s “lender of last resort” function – was and is important, unfinished work if\nwe are to have a more stable financial system.\nA number of significant reforms are being contemplated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) to reduce the risks surrounding money market funds. But even with significant\nreforms such as these – reforms, by the way, that I am highly supportive of and will say more about at\na conference in Atlanta in two weeks – money market funds will continue to be a potentially unstable\nsource of U.S. dollar funding. From a financial stability perspective, we need to recognize the\npossibility of a deterioration in the ability or willingness of the money market funds to keep providing\na dependable source of funds to counterparties (for example, the issuers of commercial paper that the\nfunds purchase). This could occur as a result of a change in the risk profile of those counterparties.\nWholesale funding issues also played an important role in recent European banking problems.\nSome European banks were too dependent on wholesale funding, particularly funding coming from\nU.S. money market funds.\nFigure 10 shows the European exposure of U.S. prime money market funds over the past year.\nGiven the changes in the risk profile of some banks, as a result of increases in sovereign debt risk,\nmoney market funds have sought to reduce what was their large risk exposure to European financial\ninstitutions. Most money market funds in the beginning of 2011 had already dramatically reduced\nexposure to peripheral financial institutions. Over the second half of last year there was a very\nsignificant decline in exposure to euro-zone financial institutions. (In addition, remaining exposure\nwas shortened in tenor, meaning time to maturity). Figure 10 highlights the declines across Europe\nand Figure 11 shows the decline over the course of 2011 more specifically by certain countries.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBecause U.S. money market funds had been a significant source of short-term funds for\nEuropean institutions, money funds’ move away from short-term European debt resulted in a\nsignificant shortage of dollar funds available to these institutions. I will show you some market\nindicators of these shortages in a moment.\nNo money market fund encountered a problem meeting investor redemptions during the\nEuropean sovereign debt crisis3. But even without such a problem, money market funds still had an\nimpact on the availability of credit to financial institutions for which the perception of risk had\nchanged.\nProblems with financial stability do not require a failure to create a significant disruption in\nthe flow of credit. In light of the incentives facing money market funds, financial institutions that rely\nheavily on them for funding put themselves in a position where a short-term change in perceived risk\ncan create significant funding problems. And as we have seen repeatedly over the past several years,\nfunding problems at one institution can quickly spread to the financial system as a whole.\nFigure 12 highlights that funding challenges for European banks were developing as money\nmarket funds reduced their European exposures. The rise in the LIBOR to OIS spread4 indicates that\nfinancial institutions became more concerned about lending to each other as money market funding\ndeclined. Similarly, the sharp rise in the rates on the 3-month euro-dollar foreign exchange swap\nindicates the pressure exerted by reduced dollar funding from the money market funds on European\nfinancial institutions’ funding.\nIn short, the rational reaction of money market funds to perceived changes in risk – reducing\nEuropean exposure – led to various funding pressures. The issues eventually were addressed by\ncentral bank actions that significantly expanded liquidity, both through foreign exchange swaps and\nthrough European Central Bank (ECB) term lending to European institutions. While these actions\nhave been very important for stabilizing financial markets, I believe we need to get to the point of\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nhaving a more resilient financial infrastructure that does not require central bank interventions during\ntimes of stress.\nFor financial institutions and supervisors this implies thinking more carefully about stress\nscenarios, and specifically about whether critical funding will evaporate when it is needed most.\nWhile Basel Capital Accord proposals will help in this respect, I would strongly suggest that stresstesting scenarios assess how well risk-sensitive sources of short-term funding will hold up in an\nenvironment of heightened risk. This liquidity-focused assessment would be an important\ncomplement to current stress testing, and a prudent aspect of risk management.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would re-emphasize that financial-market and economic\nconditions have been improving since the start of the year. Central banks have played an important\nrole in encouraging more economic growth. In the United States, accommodative monetary policy\nhas been essential to improving financial conditions, but growth remains disappointingly slow to date,\nand significant downside risks remain. Should growth slow down more than is expected, more policy\naccommodation could be advisable.\nEven if growth should improve more than expected in the U.S., the country will likely remain\nfar from what anyone would consider full employment – so in my view policy accommodation should\nonly be removed once it is clear that the Fed’s dual mandate can be achieved within a reasonable\nperiod of time.\nAs with monetary policy, work remains to be done to improve financial stability. Today I\nhave highlighted one area that deserves more attention – ensuring that we reduce the risk of\ndisruptions to credit flows that result from wholesale short-term funding problems, and that require\ncentral bank intervention.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nFor more information see prior speeches including “Global Financial Intermediaries: Lessons and Continuing\nChallenges”, “Towards Greater Financial Stability in Short-Term Credit Markets”, and “Defining Financial Stability, and\nSome Policy Implications of Applying the Definition” [available at:\n•\n•\n•\n\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/101911/index.htm,\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/092911/index.htm, and\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm, respectively].\n\n2\n\nFor more information on this aspect of the financial crisis, see a forthcoming article in The Journal of Finance entitled\n“How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities?

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s\n2012 Financial Markets Conference\n(“Financial Reform: The Devil's in the Details”)\nStone Mountain, Georgia\nApril 11, 2012\n\nI want to thank President Dennis Lockhart and the staff at the Atlanta Fed for\nputting together a very topical and engaging conference, and for inviting me to take part\non this panel. A session on money market mutual funds is particularly relevant, given the\nchanges enacted in 2010 and the additional proposals that the SEC has been developing.\nOf course, I want to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe focus of my remarks today will be financial stability. Both the financial\ncrisis in 2008 and the more recent sovereign debt problems in Europe underscored the\nsignificance of money market fund flows to short-term credit markets, and the potential\nfor disruptions in those flows and markets to create broader economic difficulties. I will\nleave it to other panelists to focus on the impact of recently implemented and proposed\nregulations on individual funds or suppliers of short-term funds. Instead I will look at\npotential reforms in the context of whether they promote financial stability.\nMoney market funds serve as important intermediaries between investors who\nwant low-risk, highly liquid investments, and banks and corporations that have short-term\nborrowing needs. Money market funds are a key buyer of the short-term debt\ninstruments issued by banks and corporations – commercial paper, bank certificates of\ndeposit, and repurchase agreements.\nGiven the importance of short-term credit markets to both investors and\nbusinesses, any disruptions to those credit markets represent a potential financial stability\nissue of both domestic and global significance. I would add that in discussions about\nways that financial problems could, potentially, be amplified into a financial crisis, I hear\nmoney market funds often brought up.\nMy comments today are going to focus on prime money market funds, as opposed\nto government funds or tax-free funds. Prime funds hold a mix of short-term debt\ninstruments including commercial paper and large certificates of deposit, as well as\nTreasury and agency securities.1 Prime funds played a critical role in the amplification of\nfinancial problems in recent years.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTo summarize, my key points today will be the following:\n\n1. Some prime funds have taken on significant credit risk – at times incurring\nlosses that necessitated the support of the parent or sponsor2 of the fund, and\nin one case substantial government support.\n2. In my view the assumption of significant credit risk is not appropriate for\nintermediaries that have no capital and implicitly promise a fixed net asset\nvalue (NAV).3\n3. Without additional reforms, this structural problem could trigger or amplify\nfuture financial stability problems. Issues of potential financial instability\nwere not fully resolved by the 2010 reforms, although those reforms were\nimportant steps forward.\n4. Fragilities related to money market funds could be significantly mitigated by\nproposed SEC reforms and, potentially, by monitoring and reducing the credit\nrisk taken by prime funds.\n\nPrime Money Market Funds and Credit Risk\nThe amount of credit risk taken by some money market funds was highlighted\nduring the financial crisis by the loss associated with the $785 million of Lehman\nsecurities held by the Reserve Primary Fund. The loss led to the Reserve Primary Fund\n“breaking the buck,” and this violation of the “as good as bank deposits” implicit promise\nled in turn to a run on many other prime money market funds as investors became\nconcerned that other funds would not be able to maintain a fixed net asset value.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUltimately, the crisis prompted the U.S. Treasury to provide emergency insurance, and\nthe Federal Reserve to provide emergency liquidity.4\nIt is very important to note that credit losses at prime money market funds have\nnot been limited to those of the Reserve Primary Fund, or related only to the failure of\nLehman Brothers. Figure 1 provides examples of other securities that were held by\nmoney market funds when their issuers defaulted over the 2007 to 2008 time frame.\nAs Chairman Schapiro of the SEC has recently noted, the “SEC staff provided noaction assurances that allowed more than 100 money market funds to enter into capital\nsupport agreements with their [sponsors] in 2007-2008.”5 In addition to many sponsor\nguarantees, no less than 47 distinct funds received direct support via a cash contribution\nor an outright purchase of distressed securities at above-market prices – and some funds\nreceived direct support more than once. Based on our review of SEC no-action letters\nand publicly available financial statements, direct support during the time period from\n2007 to 20106 was at least $3.2 billion.\nFigure 2 provides data on sponsor support. There are a number of cases between\n2007 and 2010 where identified sponsor support exceeded one percent of assets under\nmanagement (nine in total – four cases between 1 and 2 percent of assets under\nmanagement, two cases between 2 and 3 percent, and three cases over 3 percent).7 In\nfact, in one instance the dollar amount of support exceeded the amount of the Reserve\nPrimary Fund’s Lehman exposure.\nThese data highlight that a number of money market funds were taking credit risk\nthat was significant given their mandate and structural limitations, but unlike the Reserve\nPrimary Fund they had a sponsor that was willing and able to provide support.8 In the\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nabsence of the support of sponsors, many of these money market funds would have been\nunable to maintain the fixed NAV.\nGoing forward, one cannot necessarily assume that sponsors will choose to\nprovide financial support; and also, to the extent that the sponsor is a regulated financial\ninstitution that requires regulatory approval to provide support, approval of such support\nis not guaranteed. I would suggest that the ability to assume excessive credit risk under\nthese conditions reflects a potential flaw in the design of money market funds that still\nneeds to be addressed.\nThe credit risk taken by some money market funds is still significant, even after\nthe financial problems experienced from 2007 to 2010 and the recent SEC reforms. As\nrecently as the fall of 2011, a sponsor provided support to a fund as a result of its holding\nof downgraded Eksportfinans paper.\nOne of the challenges in addressing the credit risk of money market funds is that\nTier 1 securities that are supposed to reflect relatively low credit risk to money market\nfunds in reality encompass a broad range of credit quality, including some securities with\nsignificant credit risk. This is shown in Figure 3, which examines the credit risk of\nprime funds – classifying their holdings by the credit default swap (CDS) spread of the\nissuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider of the holdings. A CDS provides insurance against\ndefault risk, and the CDS spread is a measure of how costly it would be to get insurance\nagainst possible default of a security.\nAs a benchmark, the current five-year CDS spread for U.S. government securities\nis approximately 30 basis points. As the figure shows, as of September 30 of last year 23\npercent of the prime holdings had an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nquote of between 200 and 300 basis points. Note that the issuers, sponsors, or liquidity\nproviders of 4.5 percent of the holdings had CDS quotes in excess of 400 basis points.9\nThis highlights that credit markets are assigning a significant chance that some money\nmarket fund investments that current regulation deem permissible could in fact default.\nAnd, obviously, that the credit risk embedded in many prime money market mutual funds\nis substantially greater than the credit risk in U.S. government-only funds.\nThe 2008 run on money market funds that began with problems at a single fund\n(the Reserve Primary Fund) highlights the importance of understanding the credit risk of\nindividual funds, not just the average credit risk of the industry. An individual fund that\ndoes not have a sponsor that is willing or able to provide support if the fund experiences a\ncredit loss can cause a significant run for the whole industry.\nFigure 4 contrasts the credit risk exposure of two money market funds at a point\nin time in the fall of last year. It provides an indication of the within-industry variation in\ncredit risk. Each of these funds held some high-risk securities – although Fund 1 more so\nthan Fund 2 – illustrating the problem of holdings that bear more than the “minimal credit\nrisk” required by the SEC’s rule 2a-7.10 At that point in time last year, Fund 1 had 23\npercent of its assets in securities that had a credit default swap spread over 400, which for\ncontext is more than 10 times the current rate for U.S. government securities.11\nSuch within-industry variation matters because the average exposure of money\nmarket funds could look just fine, but if a highly exposed fund suffered a substantial\ncredit loss it could potentially trigger a run like the one experienced in 2008.\nA significant source of the credit risk in many prime money market funds over the\npast year has been the large exposure to European banks. Figure 5 shows the exposure\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof the industry to financial institutions in France, Italy, and Spain. While these exposures\nwere substantially reduced as the risks became more apparent, I have to question whether\ninvestors in money market funds would have been willing to directly hold such large\nexposures in foreign financial institutions, and whether such investments were consistent\nwith the perceptions of very low credit risk that many investors expect to be associated\nwith prime money market funds.12\nFigure 6 shows that while the exposure to Europe declined significantly through\nDecember 2011, 36 percent of prime money market fund assets13 remain in Europe\n(granted, generally in the stronger countries). So, when considering the so-called “tail”\nrisk from unexpected problems in Europe, money market funds remain an important\npotential transmission channel to the United States.\nA good example of this potential risk is the exposure that many money market\nfunds had to Dexia, a bank that required the support of the French and Belgian\ngovernments in the fall of 2011. Figure 7 shows that in the spring of 2011, over 60 funds\nhad exposure to Dexia.14 As the five-year credit default swap spread for Dexia rose, most\nmoney market funds substantially reduced their holdings. However, given the very high\nCDS spreads on Dexia, the extent to which money funds were willing to hold it at all is\nstriking.\nDespite the experience of the Reserve Primary Fund during 2008, a number of\nmoney market funds held securities that posed significant credit risk during the 2011\nperiod of European problems. While there were significant outflows,15 no losses or runs\noccurred – but in my view this should provide us little solace. We should care not only\nabout the realized losses, but also about the potential losses associated with risk\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nexposures. From a public policy perspective, we should in short care that significant\nrisks were taken even though the potential bad outcome did not occur.\nThe willingness of multiple money market funds to take excessive credit risk even\nafter the 2010 reforms suggests that money market funds, absent some changes, still pose\nsome risks to financial stability. Simply put, my view is that taking large credit risks is\nincompatible with being an intermediary that has no capital and implicitly promises a\nfixed net asset value.\n\nPotential Additional Actions\nWhile the 2010 reforms improved the liquidity and credit risk of money market\nfunds, I believe the data I have presented today suggest that more substantial initiatives\nare needed to reduce the risks to financial stability.\nOne possible way to mitigate the risks is to no longer transact at a fixed net asset\nvalue. This has several possible benefits, but also potential drawbacks.\nAs with other mutual funds, a floating NAV would highlight that the underlying\nasset values do fluctuate, and that the investor is taking some risk. By observing\nmovements in the NAV, investors would have regular reminders that investments in\nmoney market funds are not riskless, and that absent sponsor or government support the\nfund cannot guarantee that it will always be able to return an investor’s money dollar for\ndollar.\nFurthermore, a money market fund that takes credit risk simply cannot guarantee\nthat it will on its own pay a fixed net asset value. Should a large credit loss occur, the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfixed net asset value will not be able to be maintained unless the sponsor is willing and\nable to provide financial support.\nStill, there are two potential negatives to a floating rate NAV. First, it transforms\nthe product from a near-substitute for bank deposits into an asset with a fluctuating price.\nThose fluctuations in price, and the taxable gains or losses that result, would make money\nmarket funds less attractive as a transaction account for many investors – in part due to\nthe taxable gains or losses. Second, it only partially prevents runs, because as soon as\ninvestors become concerned about credit losses, there is a strong incentive to get out of\nthe fund early. The first investor to leave the fund (to redeem) avoids the large drops in\nvaluation and loss of liquidity that typically accompany a run.\nWhile the incentive to run is not eliminated by a floating NAV, it is certainly less\nthan for a fund with a fixed NAV that risks “breaking the buck.”16 Interestingly, floating\nNAV funds are used in Europe.\nIn sum, a move to a floating NAV would more accurately reflect the fundamental\nnature of the product actually offered, rather than making implicit promises to investors\nthat cannot always be kept during stressful times.\nAnother alternative would be to require money market funds to hold capital, and\nto impose a cost on redemptions. An appropriate redemption policy could substantially\nreduce the incentives to run. With appropriately calibrated capital and redemption\npolicies, the incentive to run (and thus the inability to fully pay investors) would be\ngreatly reduced.\nTo digress for a moment, it is important to distinguish between solvency issues\nand liquidity problems. Slowing down redemptions would assist in situations where\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthere is underlying value but a drying up of liquidity may lead to losses from “fire sale”\nprices.\nThese remedies also raise potential concerns and have costs. In general any\nreforms that, in the language of economists, would “internalize the costs” associated with\nsystemic risk would to some degree make money market funds less attractive for\ninvestors.\nRaising capital in a low interest rate environment would be challenging and,\ndepending on how it is raised, would impact returns to sponsors or investors. A change\nin redemption practices would pose a potential risk to investors that would make the\nmoney market fund less attractive relative to other products. But despite these concerns,\nappropriately calibrated capital and redemption policies would reduce the risk that\ninvestors would not be able to get full value on their redemptions or that runs would\noccur.\nBeyond the two alternatives I have discussed, there may be additional ways to\naddress these issues. There may be opportunities for SEC policymaking and monitoring\nto inhibit funds from taking on excessive credit risk. As I have shown today, the extent\nof credit risk taken by some money market funds is shown by the number of times\nsponsors have needed to provide support and by the makeup of underlying assets in\ncertain funds. The SEC limitations placed on credit risk are currently too broad to avoid\nsignificant credit risk exposure and there may be ways to use market information17 to\ndetermine if assets in the funds are inconsistent with the intent to limit significant credit\nrisk exposures at money market funds.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I believe the approaches I have mentioned today\ncould significantly mitigate financial stability concerns around money market funds. Of\ncourse, none of the proposals eliminate the risk entirely, and none are costless. Neither\nare they mutually exclusive – elements could be adopted in some combination.\nEveryone knows the SEC is working very hard on this, and could have a proposal\nfor reforms out in the coming months. I strongly commend their efforts to arrive at\nreforms that reduce the risks surrounding money market funds.\nThe bottom line, in my view, is that the status quo is not acceptable. As I have\nshown today, a number of money market funds took significant credit risk that ultimately\nled to them needing sponsor support in the period from 2007 to 2010. Substantial\ngovernment support was required after the Reserve Primary Fund experienced losses.\nMoreover, a significant number of money market funds continued to take substantial\ncredit risk during the recent European financial problems. So, I must conclude that\nreforms enacted to date do not seem to sufficiently limit money market funds’ ability to\nassume excessive credit risks.\nA money market fund with a fixed net asset value set by an intermediary with no\ncapital that takes on credit risk will, eventually, result in the failure to meet obligations in\nthe absence of outside support by either a sponsor or government. Funds need to be\nstructured so that neither sponsor support nor government support is likely or necessary,\neven during times of stress.\nI realize the industry is opposed to measures that would decrease the\nattractiveness of funds but in the end a stronger industry could result, beyond the\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfinancial stability improvements that are my main focus. But all in all I believe the risks\nto the stability of the financial system that underpins the economy are too great not to\ntake the actions that will make the industry, and our financial system, more stable.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit made up 24 percent and 25 percent of prime\nmoney market fund portfolios, respectively, at the end of February. Repurchase agreements were\n19 percent. And finally, Treasury and Agency securities were 9 percent and 10 percent,\nrespectively.\n2\n\nSponsors are the asset management firms and their parents and affiliates.\n\n3\n\nOf course, a fund prospectus typically makes clear that the NAV can drop below the fixed\nvalue.\n\n4\n\nFor more information on this aspect of the financial crisis, see a forthcoming article in The\nJournal of Finance entitled “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity\nFacilities? Evidence from the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility” – by Burcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick M. Parkinson, Eric S. Rosengren, Gustavo\nA. Suarez, and Paul S. Willen; and the related working paper of the same title and authorship,\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/bankinfo/qau/wp/2010/qau1003.pdf.\n\n5\n\nThe SEC quote uses the term “parent companies” rather than sponsors. Remarks at the Society\nof American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW) Annual Convention; Indianapolis, Indiana;\nMarch 15, 2012.\n\n6\n\nAlthough most of the covered securities defaulted in 2007 and 2008, many times these securities\nremained in money market fund portfolios with a guarantee from the parent for an extended\nperiod of time before a direct support event.\n\n7\n\nWe used the highest level of assets under management (AUM) over the reporting period\ncovered by the applicable financial statement to compute the ratio of support to AUM for each\nfund. Using the highest AUM over the period provides a conservatively biased estimate of\nsupport.\n\n8\n\nInterestingly, evidence from the financial crisis would suggest that investors are aware of this\noption on the part of sponsors. My colleague at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors,\nPatrick McCabe, finds in his paper The Cross Section of Money Market Fund Risks and Financial\nCrises that \"outflows were larger for MMFs that had paid higher gross yields in the previous year\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand thus were likely carrying greater portfolio risks, for funds with larger pre-crisis flow volatility\nthat signified greater investor risk, and for funds that had sponsors with wider credit default swap\n(CDS) spreads and hence greater sponsor risk.\"\n[See http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201051/201051pap.pdf]\n9\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, holdings with an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS spread\nof 200 basis points or more accounted for 37 percent of the value of prime holdings as of\nSeptember 30, 2011. The remaining 63 percent of the value of prime holdings included holdings\nwith an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS spread of less than 200 basis points and\nthose for which no CDS quotes were available.\n\n10\n\nMoney market funds are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and\nthe rules adopted under that Act, particularly Rule 2a-7 under the Act. See\nhttp://www.sec.gov/answers/mfmmkt.htm\n\n11\n\nLikewise in Figure 4, holdings with an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS spread\nof 200 basis points or more accounted for 48 percent and 45 percent of the value of Fund 1 and\nFund 2 holdings, respectively. The remaining 52 percent and 55 percent of the value of Fund 1\nand Fund 2 holdings included holdings with an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS\nspread of less than 200 basis points and those for which no CDS quotes were available.\n\n12\n\nAlso, you can see that the January 2012 figure shows a reversal of the downward trend.\n\n13\n\nUp from 34 percent in December.\n\n14\n\nThe Dexia holdings and CDS spreads are those of Dexia Credit Local, the Dexia Group’s\nFrench subsidiary. At the close of 2010, Dexia Credit Local held assets of 361 billion euros\n($484 billion) representing 64 percent of the assets of the Dexia Group.\n\n15\n\nFor example June 2011 had the largest outflows from prime funds of any month since the 2008\ncrisis.\n\n16\n\nWith a floating NAV, investors are not able to redeem shares at $1 when they are clearly worth\nless, so the floating NAV would mitigate somewhat the ability of redeeming investors to leave\nlosses behind.\n\n17\n\nSuch as, potentially, market pricing information on credit default swaps for certain securities.\n\n13\n\n\fMoney Market Mutual Funds\nand Financial Stability\nEric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Worcester Regional Research Bureau’s\n27th Annual Meeting\nWorcester, Massachusetts\nMay 30, 2012\n\nI would like to thank Ralph Crowley, both for his kind introduction and for his\nservice as chair of the Boston Fed’s New England Advisory Council – a group that plays\na valued role, providing us with perspectives on business conditions facing small and\nmedium-sized companies around New England. Advisory councils like the one Ralph\nchairs provide information and perspectives that help us at the Fed interpret trends in the\neconomic data.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI have been in your city a number of times in recent years, but the last time I gave\na speech in Worcester specifically on the economic outlook, like today, it was at the\nWorcester Economic Club in May of 2009. The nation was really still in the midst of the\nfinancial crisis then, so it is wonderful to be speaking with you at a somewhat more\nfavorable time.\nWe have had 11 consecutive quarters of positive growth in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) since the economic recovery began, and the unemployment rate nationally\nhas declined from a peak of 10 percent to 8.1 percent in April. However, the economic\nrecovery and the improvement in the unemployment rate continue to be frustratingly\nslow. My outlook, unfortunately, is for growth right around its “potential” rate of\nbetween two and two-and-a-half percent – which implies no significant improvement in\nlabor markets over the course of this year. Of course I would add that all the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAnd even this modest pace of growth is contingent on some fairly significant\nassumptions – that Europe will be able to muddle through its current problems, and that\nin the United States the government will be able to reach agreements to avoid a so-called\n“fiscal cliff” looming at the end of this year. Under current law, at the end of 2012\ncertain factors – including the expiration of unemployment benefits and the payroll tax\ncut, revisions to the Alternative Minimum Tax, the expiration of the so-called “Bush tax\ncuts,” and sequestration (automatic spending cuts) associated with the Budget Control\nAct of 2011 – would together restrain growth by a significant fraction of GDP.1\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecent Economic Data\nI would note that there has been some positive news contained in recent economic\ndata. Figure 1 shows the improvements in two components of real GDP that are linked\nto households. Consumption grew 2.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, a rate that\nis faster than the previous three quarters and faster than the 2.2 percent growth of the\noverall economy. Similarly, residential investment grew 19.1 percent in the first quarter\nof this year, faster than the previous three quarters – and obviously well above the rate of\ngrowth in the overall economy.2\nThinking optimistically, the improvement in residential investment may finally be\nsignaling that the housing sector will not continue to be a source of significant restraint\non economic growth. However, my enthusiasm for a housing recovery is still moderated\n– by the evidence of challenges in obtaining housing finance, by the number of borrowers\nwho owe more than their house is worth, and by the still very elevated level of home\nforeclosures.\nIndeed, as Figure 2 shows, housing prices across the country are moving\ntogether, and are likely being restrained by similar headwinds, rather than principally\nreflecting regional trends. I would expect that as the housing sector improves along with\nthe national economy, regional differences would become prevalent and we would see a\nweaker correlation of housing prices across different regions of the country than we see\nto the far right in Figure 2.\nAnd while some sectors of the economy are improving, some significant\nheadwinds remain. Figure 3 shows two of them. Government spending has been\ndeclining,3 which regardless of your political views means, in the short term, less\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\naggregate demand and less growth in the economy. And without further action by\nCongress to avoid the “fiscal cliff” that I mentioned earlier, national fiscal policy has the\npotential to be a much bigger headwind to faster growth in the coming year.\nBusiness investment has also been slowing. While business investment was a\nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, companies have slowed investment\nspending more recently. To the extent that concerns over a possible worsening of future\nEuropean economic problems and a possible U.S. fiscal contraction make U.S. businesses\nmore tentative, these worries about the future can impede a more rapid recovery now.\nThis is a particularly difficult time to forecast the economy, given that significant\npolitical decisions can influence economic actions. To highlight why we should be\nhumble about our forecasting abilities, we need only look at the size of revisions to the\nGDP numbers shown in Figure 4. The chart highlights the significant uncertainty\nassociated with measures of recent economic growth. The blue dashed line plots the\nadvance estimates of real GDP growth. The data are revised in subsequent months as\nmore information becomes available, for example additional data on foreign trade and\ninventories. However, even those estimates can be significantly revised – see the red,\ngreen, and blue marks on the chart – once tax data and other information become\navailable to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. As the chart shows, it is not\nuncommon for the revised data to differ from the preliminary estimates of GDP by as\nmuch as a percentage point.\nGiven the difficulty in measuring even the recent past, it should not be too\nsurprising that estimates of the future are even more problematic. For example,\neconomic forecasters need to make assumptions about the fiscal measures likely to be\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntaken by European countries, some of which are facing elections with quite stark policy\nchoices represented by the candidates on the ballot. And forecasters need to make\nassumptions about fiscal policy in the United States, even though it goes without saying\nthat political choices made up and down the ballot by the U.S. electorate in the fall could\nlead to quite different policies.\nSince economists have no particular expertise in forecasting political results, they\nmake estimates based on modeling likely outcomes – which often assume only modest\ndivergence from the recent past. Despite the uncertainty inherent in them, these\neconomic forecasts are an important aspect of how monetary policy is set.\nAt the Fed, we are now producing and publicly disclosing the estimates of real\nGDP growth, unemployment, and PCE4 inflation rates produced by the FOMC\nparticipants5 in a Summary of Economic Projections. The central tendency6 of the\nFOMC participants’ estimated forecasts, and my own current forecast, are provided in\nFigure 5.\nYou can see that my own forecasts are a little more pessimistic than the central\ntendency of the participants at the April FOMC meeting. I am expecting growth of only\n2.3 percent for the full year, I’m sorry to say; and unfortunately no improvement in the\ncurrent U.S. unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. As you can see, I also expect both total\nPCE inflation and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent for 2012. My forecast of\nrelative weakness in the economy reflects concern that the uncertainty about both Europe\nand the U.S. federal “fiscal cliff” will restrain spending by households and businesses –\nbut it also assumes that Europe and our own fiscal situation achieve a “muddling\nthrough.”\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI would, however, highlight the uncertainty and downside risks to my forecast.\nOne downside risk is that European problems could become a much greater restraint on\ngrowth this year. Another downside risk is that Middle East problems could cause an oil\nsupply shock that negatively affects economic growth. And another is that much greater\nfiscal austerity could result from a potential failure to reach budget agreements.\nGiven my expectations of only modest growth, no improvement in the\nunemployment rate, an inflation forecast below 2 percent, and significant downside risks\nto the forecast, I believe monetary policy should remain accommodative at this time and\nindeed that we should be looking for ways that monetary policy can foster more rapid\ngrowth, to bring down the unemployment rate more quickly. I believe further monetary\npolicy accommodation is both appropriate and necessary. The U.S., like many other\ncountries, needs to facilitate a more rapid recovery, and monetary policy is one important\ntool with the potential still for encouraging faster growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nNow I’d like to focus in on labor markets. I remain especially concerned about\nthe ongoing weakness there. While most observers are concerned about labor market\nconditions, views differ on why unemployment remains so persistently and painfully\nhigh. Some believe there are structural reasons like shortages of specific skills, or labor\nshortages in specific geographic regions. If this argument were true, then the more\nstimulative monetary policy I am proposing might not be wise.\nBut I will present some analysis today that argues that most of the problem is in a\nlack of aggregate demand – in the parlance of economists, it is cyclical more than\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nstructural. This is not to dismiss entirely some structural components of the current high\nunemployment rate. Certainly there are situations where the skills of people who had lost\njobs were not well aligned with the skill sets needed in some sectors that are hiring, such\nas advanced manufacturing and health care. But I believe the evidence shows the bulk of\nthe problem is cyclical. Furthermore, my desire to stimulate more growth now is partly\nto prevent the structural problem from becoming more severe because the economy did\nnot re-employ workers more quickly.\nFigure 6 highlights that all census regions experienced a significant decline in\nemployment during the recent recession, and also that there is surprisingly little regional\nvariation during this modest recovery. The lines move together at the extreme right of\nthe chart, versus the earlier periods depicted on the rest of the chart. While recessions\ntend to impact all regions of the country simultaneously, recoveries are normally more\nvaried across regions. Differences in industrial composition and idiosyncratic variation\ncause regions to diverge as the recovery progresses.\nOne reason for the current similarity across regions is that two weak sectors, state\nand local government spending and residential investment, remain much weaker than is\nusual for this stage of a recovery, and have been impacting all regions of the country.\nThe similarity across regions also highlights that inadequate demand – rather than\nregional employment shortages in faster growing areas – is driving employment patterns.\nFigure 7 further illustrates this point. Nationally, the unemployment rate is 8.1\npercent, well above the unemployment rate in December 2007 before the onset of the\nrecession. In fact, all census regions have much higher unemployment rates than they did\nbefore the onset of the recession, and no region today has an unemployment rate that I\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwould see as consistent with full employment. Again, the state of affairs we see today is\nnot consistent with serious bottlenecks created by rapid growth in certain regions\npreventing further progress in labor markets.\nFigure 8 illustrates in rather stark terms how unusual this recovery has been. In\nthe previous three recoveries the previous peak in employment was reached within two\nyears of the start of the recovery. In the current recovery, which has already exceeded\ntwo years in length, employment still remains more than 3 percent lower than the peak\nprior to the recession. This is partly because the recovery has been slow, and partly\nbecause the employment decline was so large.\nFigure 9 shows the current recovery and also shows employment when the\nconstruction and government sectors are excluded (the dashed lines). These two sectors\nhave been unusually weak in this recovery – but even when these sectors are excluded,\nemployment is nowhere close to its previous peak. This highlights that employment\nweakness is not tied just to problems in specific sectors of the economy.\nFigure 10 shows employment growth across industries. This recession was\nunusual in how pervasive the decline was across industries, reflecting a very sharp drop\nin overall demand as businesses significantly retrenched, given the severity of the\ndownturn. Moreover, during the recovery the pattern has been similar across industries –\nwith a modest pickup in employment across industries but no industry standing out as\nhaving comparably rapid growth. Again this seems more reflective of inadequate\ndemand rather than structural impediments to growth, such as major industries being\nunable to find sufficient workers.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAnd if firms were having difficulty hiring, one would expect to see wages and\nsalaries rising in their industries. Figure 11 highlights that wages and salaries have been\ngrowing only slowly, and in most industries it is below two percent – consistent with\nweak labor demand in general. The tight bunching of wage and salary growth at low\nlevels in the recent period shown to the right of the chart does not give evidence that\ncertain industries are bidding up wages and salaries because of difficulty finding workers.\nThese employment and wage patterns are consistent with a very modest recovery\nin most industries and most regions of the country. Growth has been only modest\nnationally, and I believe we need substantially more growth if we want to achieve full\nemployment within a reasonable period of time.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe economy continues to recover, albeit at only a modest pace. I do not expect\ngrowth to pick up significantly, and therein do not expect marked improvement in the\nvery weak labor markets.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with what is known as our “dual\nmandate” – using monetary policy to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable\nemployment over a reasonable horizon. The unemployment rate is well above what I\nexpect it to be over the long run, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably high for\nwhat I consider far too long. And PCE inflation is likely to be below 2 percent this year\nand for some time to come.\nGiven the poor current conditions and my forecast for continued weakness – and\nthe evidence that suggests the problem is one of aggregate demand rather than structural\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment – I believe monetary policy needs to be more stimulative if we hope to\nmeet both elements of the dual mandate in a reasonable time frame. And should some of\nthe downside risks that I have emphasized materialize, such as a significant disruption\nfrom abroad, more aggressive actions would certainly be warranted.\nI thank you again for inviting me to discuss the economy, and policy, with you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on May 22 released a study on the “Economic Effects of\nReducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Occur in 2013.” The CBO noted “Under those fiscal\nconditions, which will occur under current law, growth in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in calendar year\n2013 will be just 0.5 percent, CBO expects—with the economy projected to contract at an annual rate of\n1.3 percent in the first half of the year and expand at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second half. Given\nthe pattern of past recessions as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research, such a\ncontraction in output in the first half of 2013 would probably be judged to be a recession.” [see\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/publication/43262]\n2\n\nSome suggest temporary factors like an unusually mild winter may have boosted Q1 residential\ninvestment to that degree.\n3\n\nOn a real basis.\n\n4\n\nPCE stands for “personal consumption expenditures.” PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the\npercentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures and the\nprice index for PCE excluding food and energy.\n5\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC is the committee that sets monetary policy for the U.S.\nFOMC participants include Federal Reserve Board members and regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents.\nAlthough Reserve Bank presidents vote on the FOMC on a rotating basis, the projections include all\npresidents’ input, not just those of current voting members.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAt the Institute of International Finance\nSpring Membership Meeting\nJune 7, 2012\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nI have been asked to briefly discuss the risks to the economic and financial outlook.1 In\nsome sense, this is much easier than the jobs assigned to other panelists tasked with forecasting the\noutlook for either financial markets or the real economy. At a time when some of the risk scenarios\nare increasingly seeping into relevance, forecasting the most likely outcome can be quite difficult.\nRisks that one year ago were viewed as so-called “tail-risk events” are increasingly being\nintegrated into many peoples’ base forecasts. This shift highlights that risks are once again on the\nrise, and that uncertainty about some of the challenges facing the global economy is already\nimpacting the economic behavior of households and businesses.\n\n1\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\nSuch uncertainty is leading to a degree of risk aversion that becomes apparent when we look\nat 10-year government bond rates in the U.S., U.K., and Germany (Figure 1). In all three countries,\n10-year government bond rates are well below the inflation targets of their respective central banks.\nThe fact that 10-year government bonds are trading at well below 2 percent indicates that perceived\nrisks are leaving investors willing to purchase an asset that would provide a negative real return for\n10 years (assuming that central banks are successful in hitting their inflation targets). For investors\nto view this pricing as reasonable implies that rising inflation is not a prime concern of financial\nmarket participants. It seems investors believe that central banks are more likely to undershoot their\ninflation targets than overshoot them, and that policymakers need to be particularly attentive to the\ndownside risks of their economic and financial outlooks – and examine how best to mitigate these\nrisks.\nSome analysts have focused on direct exposures of financial institutions to a particular\ngeographic location as a measure of current risk exposures. I would say that such measures do not\ncapture the true risks. For example, in 2008 signs of potential disruption in financial intermediation\nactivity and liquidity were a much better gauge of the financial and economic risks building up in\nthe system than were measures of direct exposure to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. While it took many\nmonths for sub-prime credit losses to materialize, sources of short-term funding dried up well in\nadvance, providing a timelier indicator of underlying stresses than measures of credit exposure.\nThis episode highlights the risk that remains today to any institution that relies heavily on shortterm funding to finance its business, and suggests that monitoring stresses in short-term funding\nmarkets may provide better early indications of troubles to come.\nIn 2008, many financial institutions learned that strategies of capital arbitrage, often in the\nform of holding assets off-balance sheet to avoid capital charges, were profitable during good times\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\nbut were recipes for disaster during times of financial stress. Those structures quickly lost the\nconfidence of counterparties who had been funding them, and thus became a significant problem to\nfinancial institutions. Fortunately, some of the most egregious structures, like certain structured\ninvestment vehicles (SIVs), have been wound down.\nFurthermore, many financial institutions have taken measures over the past several years to\nbolster capital and liquidity. However, we – banks and regulators – need to understand better how\nfunding models and investment structures are likely to behave under severe stress. Our best way to\nlearn more about that is through ongoing stress tests. Such tests should focus on undercapitalized\nstructures, or structures that are sufficiently opaque or risky that they are likely to require significant\ncapital or liquidity at a time when they are particularly expensive.\nFinancial institutions and their regulators must make continued progress in reducing the\ninstitutions’ sensitivity to rapid changes in risk preferences, and the consequences of such shifts for\nfunding the assets of many institutions. In recent years and recent weeks, such shifts have pulled\nfunders out of many risky investments and into the lowest-risk financial vehicles – most often the\nsovereign debt of the safest countries. This dynamic lies behind the recent surge in demand for\nU.S., U.K., and German bonds. The financial system remains quite vulnerable to this rapid\nshrinkage of funding sources.\nA second significant risk is that a failure to decisively resolve banking problems could cause\ncollateral damage to the global economy. Historically, Japan is probably the leading example of\nhow the failure to aggressively address banking problems can yield serious collateral damage. A\nprotracted period of deleveraging of bank balance sheets, coupled with a persistent pattern of\nallocating capital to defer the realization of unavoidable losses, can cause an extended period of\nsignificantly misallocated resources. Such misallocation hoards scarce funds in inefficient\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\ninvestments and siphons them away from profitable and productive new investment opportunities.\nThe combination of a banking system in denial, with business and households that are constrained\nby deleveraging and risk-avoidance, helps explain why recessions that are accompanied by financial\ncrises are often deeper and slower to recover.\nThe global economy remains at risk. The longer the risks I have highlighted remain\nunaddressed, the more that investors, financial institutions, households, and businesses will shift\nwhat they considered tail risks into their expected outcomes. In this way, concerns about the\npossibility of future problems cause a substantial reduction in current economic growth.\nPolicymakers and financial institutions need to continue to improve the robustness of the financial\nsystem in order to minimize the impact of this uncertainty.\nThank you for inviting me to join this panel today.\n\nFigure 1\nTen-Year Government Bond Yields\nApril 24, 2012 - June 4, 2012\n\nPercent\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nGermany\n\n1.0\n24-Apr-2012\n\n01-May-2012\n\n08-May-2012\n\n15-May-2012\n\n22-May-2012\n\n29-May-2012\n\nSource: U.S. Treasury, Financial Times / Haver Analytics\n\n4\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nof research topics. I am happy for the opportunity to discuss how problems in financial markets and\nat financial intermediaries can spill over into the real economy, especially at a central bank that has\nhad a longstanding interest in these issues.\nAs always, I should note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(the FOMC).\nSince the severe financial stresses of 2008, a variety of actions have been taken to strengthen\nthe financial infrastructure and make banks more resilient in the face of adverse shocks. While many\nbanks have improved their capital and liquidity positions since 2008, we still see in the headlines of\nnewspapers around the world that financial stability remains very much an issue.\nIn some ways, central bankers must approach the issue of financial stability much like a\nstructural engineer. Where are the potential stresses in the system? Under what circumstances could\nthose stresses be particularly problematic? Most importantly, what remedial actions could reduce the\npossibility of an unstable outcome?\nToday I want to highlight an area where remedial action is still required. My goal is to focus\nmore attention on financial structures that by design or reality1 reduce or avoid capital charges – what\nis often called engaging in “capital arbitrage.” Such structures are vulnerable to stresses that can have\ndestabilizing effects on financial markets and the broader economy. After some introductory\ncomments about financial structures with inadequate capital, I will touch on two specific areas that\nmerit consideration – money market mutual funds sponsored by banking organizations, and brokerdealer financing.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThe Social Costs of Financial Structures with Inadequate Capital\nHolding little or no capital for risky activities can, during good times, generate significant\nprofits; even in relatively low-margin businesses. However, during times of stress, the power of\nleverage works in reverse, amplifying the negative impact of risky activities and necessitating\nsubstantial capital and liquidity at a time when both are in short supply.\nThese problems become compounded in episodes when the inadequacy of capital becomes\napparent in the marketplace. Investors who normally fund these structures, very often via short-term\nlending, flee – and they also flee financial institutions that are perceived to stand behind these\nstructures (sponsoring institutions, which I will discuss in a moment). In this way, the capital\narbitrage that motivated the risky structures could contribute to a liquidity strain on what has come to\nbe known as the shadow banking system, and could stress the financial institutions that were integral\nto its creation. The reason we care about this is that such an episode often produces instability in\nimportant channels for funding real economic activity – so these Wall Street concerns can have Main\nStreet impacts.2\nStructured investment vehicles or “SIVs” illustrated this dynamic very well. Financial\ninstitutions created SIVs as off-balance-sheet structures that were financed with short-term liabilities\nbut frequently invested in longer-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities.3 The associated\ncredit and interest-rate risk became apparent, as losses from these assets rose. Investors were no\nlonger willing to purchase the short-term paper issued by these structures. Consequently, many\nfinancial institutions, as a result of implicit or explicit guarantees, were forced to bring these assets\nonto their balance sheet – where they were often subject to more significant capital requirements.\nThis led to substantial losses, balance sheet expansion, and a shortage of capital – all of which\nhindered the meeting of funding needs in the real economy.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nFortunately, the riskiest and most opaque structures of this sort have largely disappeared from\nthe marketplace. But problematic structures still remain.\nRuns on complex securitizations, prime money market mutual funds, and investment banks all\ncontributed to the severity of the 2008 crisis. Compounding the problem, the investment bank\nstructures were built on an assumption that runs were unlikely as long as lenders held collateral\nagainst their loans. In the depths of the crisis, however, lenders realized that relying on collateral\ncould leave them with securities that they did not wish to hold – or in some cases that they were not\neven legally allowed to hold.4 When large losses on subprime mortgage assets and complex products\namplified uncertainty about the value of collateral, investors ran – even though they held\ncollateralized positions.\nDespite the lessons provided by the crisis, there remain a variety of financial structures that are\n“capital efficient” from the perspective of market participants, but in my view continue to be\nsusceptible to strains on short-term funding during times of financial market stress or crisis.\nI will argue today that one way to address these structures is to make them the focus of stress\ntests that result in meaningful decisions about capital adequacy. Continuing the structural engineer\nanalogy, the stress tests can be helpful much in the way that structural engineers test the resilience of\ndifferent designs against modeled events like earthquakes and storms. Banking organizations that\nsponsor so-called capital-efficient structures should conduct stress tests that include a focus on\nwhether these structures will require support during periods of severe market or idiosyncratic stress,\nand what the impact would be on the organization at that time. This might lead financial institutions\nto be more attentive to these undercapitalized structures, consistent with institutions focusing on the\namount of capital required to survive stressed conditions – rather than the capital needed strictly to\nsatisfy regulatory requirements.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBy using stress tests to identify the possible capital and liquidity demands from these\nstructures during a crisis, the institution’s management, board of directors, and regulators can better\ndetermine the appropriateness of the structures and the associated capital and liquidity – and whether\nthese structures are likely to be beneficial to the organization at all times, or only during good times.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Funds Sponsored by Banking Organizations\n\nAs an example, I want to highlight money market mutual fund sponsors in the United States.\nSpecifically, I will discuss the possibility of using stress tests to illuminate the impact of various\nscenarios on fund sponsors, many of which are banks or financial institutions.\nMy primary focus will be on prime money market mutual funds, with approximately $1.41\ntrillion in total assets as of May 31.5 Prime funds invest in a variety of securities that carry more\ncredit risk than traditional U.S. Treasury securities.6 Money market mutual funds allow investors to\npotentially earn a higher return on short-term investments in part because – unlike banks – money\nmarket mutual funds are not required to hold capital. As a result, they often pay a competitive rate\nrelative to bank deposits, and they provide investors many features similar to traditional bank deposits\n– for example, immediate availability of funds as well as a fixed net asset value that does not fluctuate\nwhen the value of assets held by the money fund changes.\nSo money market mutual funds provide investors with an investment vehicle with features like\nbank deposits – but the funds do not hold capital. The problem is that a financial intermediary –\nwhich has no capital, but takes credit risk, and provides under normal circumstances7 immediately\navailable funds at a fixed net asset value – may be inviting trouble. Such a fund can be susceptible if\nthe credit risk of the assets it invests in were to rise, causing investors to become concerned about the\nfund’s ability to sell its assets, meet redemption demands, and maintain a stable net asset value.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nConsequently, the implicit expectation of a bank-deposit-like investment can unravel, and the\nincentives to redeem could be strong.\nAs Figure 1 shows, when the Reserve Primary Fund could no longer provide a fixed net asset\nvalue to investors in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure, investors ran not only from the Reserve\nPrimary Fund, but also from prime money market mutual funds in general. The top panel shows the\noutflows in the form of the daily changes in prime fund assets. It is particularly easy for investors to\nexit prime money market mutual funds, especially when they can easily redeem shares8 from a prime\nfund and invest the proceeds in a government-securities-only fund, even within the same fund family.\nAs is clear in Figure 1, the large outflow of funds from prime money market mutual funds was\naccompanied to a notable degree by an inflow of funds to government-only money market mutual\nfunds. This is shown in the bottom panel on the figure.\nWhile the funds may remain in the same fund family with this shift, investors who do not exit\nfrom the prime money market mutual fund could be financially impacted,9 and the prime fund might\nneed to engage in a fire sale of assets to meet investor demands. Furthermore, firms counting on\nmoney market mutual funds to provide funding (for example by buying their debt – their commercial\npaper) can suddenly find that the primary purchasers of their paper are no longer active in the\nmarket.10\nFacing all this in 2008, as well as the damage to credit flows and eventually economic activity\nin general, the U.S. Treasury responded to the run on prime money market mutual funds by providing\ninsurance, and the Federal Reserve created a lending facility designed to provide liquidity to money\nmarket mutual funds.11 Questions remain as to whether support could or would be possible today,\ngiven changes ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOur concerns should be amplified by the fact that many prime funds are sponsored by\ndepository institutions or their affiliates. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of prime money market\nmutual funds (by percent of assets and by number of funds) by category of sponsor. Just under half\nthe assets are held in funds sponsored by an asset manager not affiliated with a depository institution.\nBut domestic (U.S.) bank holding companies, foreign bank holding companies, and savings and loan\nholding companies (in other words companies affiliated with depository institutions) combined serve\nas the sponsoring organizations for a bit more than half the prime fund assets, and more than half of\nthe number of funds.\nWhile SEC regulations restrict the credit risk and maturity risk of prime money market mutual\nfund investments, these funds nonetheless can and do invest in risky assets. An example is provided\nby the number and value of Dexia obligations held by money market mutual funds at the end of 2010,\nless than one year before the Belgian and French governments needed to bail out the bank.\nAs Figure 3 shows, a large number of money market mutual funds with various types of\nsponsors held Dexia paper at the beginning of the year in which Dexia failed. However, funds\nsponsored by banks or bank affiliates were over-weighted relative to funds sponsored by asset\nmanagement firms not affiliated with a bank, both in the number of funds invested in Dexia and the\nvalue of Dexia assets.\nParticularly notable is the number of foreign-bank-sponsored money market mutual funds with\nexposure to Dexia. While money funds unloaded their Dexia holdings before the government bailout,\nthere was a noteworthy willingness to hold the obligations of a troubled large financial intermediary\nthat had widely known problems – perhaps because many expected it to receive government support\nin the event of distress. This is similar to what happened with the Lehman failure – when such\nexpectations turned out to be quite wrong.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nAs recent studies have highlighted, it is quite common for money market mutual funds that\nhave impaired assets to obtain support from their sponsors.12 Whether this is a cash infusion or a\npurchase at face value of an impaired asset,13 this support can represent draws on capital14 at times\nwhen the sponsoring organization is facing other capital pressures.\nFigure 4 shows support-related losses by fund sponsors, using data provided by Moody’s and\nbroken down by sponsor type. Moody’s data capture losses attributed to money market mutual funds\nthat are disclosed on the sponsoring company’s financial statements.15 Note that depository\ninstitution sponsors had significant losses during 2008, a time when many depository institutions were\nalready facing significant capital and liquidity pressures.\nWhile most of the losses were during stressful times, even during non-stressful times there are\nsome losses. Figure 5 sums the losses recognized over the five-year period of 2007 to 2011. The\ndegree of sponsor support is substantial. Support has been quite large and particularly prevalent for\nprime money market mutual funds which have depository institution or depository institution\naffiliated sponsors. Over this period, Moody’s reports almost $9 billion in losses associated with\nmoney market mutual funds by depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors.\nThe SEC has been working on reform proposals that would provide several measures to\nreduce the risk of stresses during times of financial market crisis and provide some capital support.16\nI am very supportive of the current push within the SEC for additional reforms, which have the\npotential of mitigating many of the concerns I am sharing today. As the primary regulator of money\nfunds, the SEC is in a position to adopt rules that would address the vulnerabilities of those funds\nmore comprehensively, effectively, and efficiently than other approaches. However, at this time it is\nunclear what the final proposal will be, or whether the SEC’s final proposal will be adopted.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nIn the absence of such reforms for all money market mutual funds, an alternative for funds\nwith depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors would be to include likely\nmoney market mutual fund support in the sponsor’s stress tests. Based on the historical experience of\ntheir money market funds, the historical experience of similar funds, and their money market funds’\nexposures, sponsors could calculate the likely capital support needed from the organization in a stress\nscenario.\nAgain, this is an admittedly partial approach, in the absence of more comprehensive reforms\nthat I hope will occur. But this approach would at least make more banking organizations more\nresilient (it would not be just money market mutual fund structures that would need capital – any\nfinancial structure that broke down during stress would need more capital) but it would also make\nclearer to money market mutual fund investors that banks had capital that could support funds during\nstressful periods. It would thus make clear that money market mutual funds with well capitalized\nsponsors are likely to be less risky than those that do not have well capitalized sponsors.\nSimilarly, other financial products that circumvent standard capital requirements – such as non\n2a-7 “money market like” funds, stable value wrap products, and asset-backed commercial paper –\ncould lead investors to expect that the sponsor holds capital for the support that these products could\nneed in times of stress. While some firms are likely to argue they would not provide support for socalled capital efficient products, the high frequency of support of money market mutual funds and\nother off-balance-sheet items during the crisis makes such claims dubious.\nIn fact, this support might be encouraged by regulators during a crisis, in order to avoid\nbroader problems of financial instability. U.S. banking regulators have17 tacitly acknowledged that\nbank holding companies may provide such support, subject to limitations identified in Figure 6.18\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBroker-Dealer Financing\nAllow me now to turn to a second area for consideration. What we call broker-dealer\nfinancing became particularly problematic during the financial crisis. With the failure of Bear Stearns\nand Lehman, it became apparent that broker-dealers, like traditional depository institutions, could be\nvulnerable to stresses during times of crisis.\nFor depository institutions, of course, concerns over the potential for runs have led to\nsignificant regulations to reduce their likelihood. During the Great Depression, runs on banks created\nbanking panics that resulted in large losses for depositors and a significant reduction in credit – and\nthose difficult episodes led to a variety of regulations to make runs on banks less likely. The creation\nof deposit insurance reduced the incentive for insured depositors to run during periods of financial\nstress, and mitigated the sharp reduction in credit availability that accompanies large deposit outflows\nfrom banks. In addition, in the U.S. (and some other countries) depository institutions have access to\nthe central bank’s “lender of last resort” credit facilities, which are intended to provide liquidity but\nnot protection from insolvency. Deposit insurance and the lender of last resort function assist banks in\nproviding one of their fundamental services – transforming short-term deposits into longer-term\nassets, since the risk of a sudden need to liquidate assets to meet unexpected outflows of deposits is\ngreatly diminished.\nBroker-dealers in the United States have not had the benefit of similar regulatory protections.\nThey do not typically have access to central bank lending, and they do not have insurance that reduces\nthe risk of unexpected outflows. Instead, broker-dealers rely on collateralized arrangements that\nallow them to be market makers, under the assumption that wholesale creditors will be comfortable\nproviding funds as long as there is sufficient collateral backing them. In addition, banks that are part\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nof larger bank holding companies are subject to Section 23 A and B restrictions designed to protect\nthe deposit insurance fund from providing support to non-bank affiliates, including broker-dealers.\nFigure 7 details the direct access that broker-dealers have to central bank credit in various\njurisdictions as well as constraints to indirect access through affiliated banks. It shows the differences\nacross countries in providing liquidity to broker-dealers from the central bank or from bank affiliates.\nIn both Switzerland and Japan, broker-dealers do have access to liquidity facilities at the central bank.\nHowever, it is not unusual to place limitations on the ability of bank affiliates to provide liquidity to\ntheir broker dealer affiliates as countries seek to avoid or limit having deposit insurance funds\nexposed to non-bank affiliate activities.\nFigure 8 summarizes the average composition of the balance sheets of large bank holding\ncompanies with high and low concentrations of broker-dealer activities. The figure highlights the\nvery different asset-liability mix, on average, of bank holding companies that have sizeable brokerdealer operations compared to those that do not. A traditional depository institution has loans as the\nprimary asset class, and core deposits as the primary liability category. The loans and certain\nsecurities held can serve as collateral for potential discount window borrowings, and deposit\ninsurance limits the incentive for insured depositors to run.\nIn contrast, bank holding companies with a relatively high concentration of broker-dealer\nactivity tend to hold more assets that are liquid and invest in highly marketable securities that can be\nrefinanced through repurchase agreements – since broker-dealer operations cannot be funded by\ninsured deposits. In short, you see greater use of short-term, non-deposit funding sources at the bank\nholding companies with high concentrations of broker-dealer activity.\nDuring the financial crisis in 2008, the difficulty in maintaining collateralized funding\nprompted the introduction of a primary dealer credit facility at the Federal Reserve. This facility\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nprovided a way for broker-dealers to obtain short-term funding for their marketable securities because\nthey otherwise did not have direct access to the Fed’s discount window.\nGiven the potential liquidity challenges to broker-dealer financing during periods of great\nstress, many broker-dealers have bolstered their regulatory capital and adjusted the composition of\ntheir balance sheet. Figure 9 shows that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer affiliates\nhave been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital ratios and holding more Tier 1 common\nequity capital than bank holding companies with less of a concentration in broker-dealer activities\n(although they have also been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital). Figure 10 shows that\nthe improvement in capital is less dramatic when using a leverage ratio measure of capital that does\nnot reflect a shift to lower risk-weighted assets.\nMarkets are sensitive to the differences in these risk profiles. Figure 11 shows how stock\nprices of bank holding companies were impacted during three elevated stress periods – the fall of\n2008, the fall of 2011, and the first part of this year. The chart shows that during stress periods, bank\nholding companies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price response\nto the stress periods than institutions with greater concentrations in broker-dealer activities.\nOne way to assess the increased market sensitivity of bank holding companies might be to\nmodel in stress tests how a sudden shortage of liquidity might impact broker-dealer operations, and\ndetermine the capital implications. Potentially, broker-dealers could be structured in such a way that\nliquidity facilities would not be necessary for broker-dealers during times of financial stress.\nHowever, if a stress test highlights the benefits to those firms of having additional capital or\nmore liquid assets, it should also take into account the costs involved. Firms might be less willing to\nmake markets in less liquid assets or might shrink their balance sheets to meet higher capital\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nrequirements, and thus reduce market-making activities in potentially important sectors of financial\nmarkets.\nAn alternative would be to develop a framework where, under certain conditions, liquidity\nfacilities would be regularly made available for broker-dealers during periods of high stress. This\narrangement would recognize that, like more traditional depositories, broker-dealers are subject to\nilliquidity in markets, and their reaction to that illiquidity can exacerbate the problem.\nFrom a public policy perspective, the rationale for promoting market functioning during times\nof stress is that liquidity strains and other stresses at market makers, like the matter of runs on\ndepositories, can have a broader impact on the overall economy. However, more analytical work\nneeds to be done to better understand broker-dealer activities during times of stress, as well as the\npotential costs and benefits of alternatives for addressing the potential for stresses at broker-dealers.19\nAt a minimum, stress tests that focus on the behavior of broker-dealers and their counterparties during\ntimes of stress should be undertaken and their implications well understood.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would note that a major innovation that resulted from the financial crisis was\nincreased attention to stress tests. The stress tests provide an opportunity for banking organization\nmanagement teams, boards of directors, investors, and regulators to better understand the impact of\nstressful financial conditions. Increasing the focus of stress tests beyond safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions to more systemic concerns and implications — such as how markets and\ninstitutions behave during periods of stress — is an under-researched area that deserves more\nattention. These are the relatively early stages of understanding how best to conduct stress tests, and\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nwhat the implications of those tests should be for financial institutions. This is, and will continue to\nbe, an iterative process.\nI have highlighted two areas where more work needs to be done. The first is to provide more\nfocus on financial structures that were designed to be “capital efficient.” Such structures can be major\nstress points in the financial infrastructure. Using stress tests to better understand the implications of\nundercapitalized financial structures will take time, but needs to be better integrated into frameworks\nfor managing and supervising institutions. Money market mutual funds with bank or bank affiliated\nsponsors provide one example, especially because there has been a pattern of support for money\nmarket mutual funds without an explicit recognition that such funds can be a capital drain during\ntimes of stress.\nA second area that deserves more attention is the behavior and resilience of broker-dealer\narrangements during times of financial stress. While the role of depositories and their susceptibility to\nruns has received much attention, I believe more work needs to be done on the implications of\npotential crisis-related stresses at broker-dealers that do not have access to liquidity facilities.\nUtilizing stress tests to better understand vulnerabilities should help inform us about ways to enhance\nfinancial stability.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I look forward to our continued\nprogress on these important issues of financial stability – which, as we have learned, can impact the\nreal economy and all its participants.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nIn the case of money market mutual funds, the initial motivation of the design was to provide investors a way\nto avoid Regulation Q restrictions. In practice, the money market mutual fund structure also has what some\nwould see as a competitive benefit – holding no capital while banks did need to hold capital. Thus, even after\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nRegulation Q restrictions no longer applied, money market mutual funds remained an alternative to deposits in\nbanks.\n2\n\n3\n\nFor more information see prior speeches including the following:\n•\n\n“Remarks for a Panel Discussion of the Global Outlook and Risks” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/060712/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Money Market Mutual Funds and Financial Stability” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/041112/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Avoiding Complacency: The U.S. Economic Outlook, and Financial Stability” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/032712/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Global Financial Intermediaries: Lessons and Continuing Challenges” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/101911/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Towards Greater Financial Stability in Short-Term Credit Markets” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/092911/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Defining Financial Stability, and Some Policy Implications of Applying the Definition” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm\n\nIn other words, engaged in credit intermediation and maturity transformation.\n\n4\n\nSee the recent speech by Federal Reserve Board Governor Daniel Tarullo, who noted that “In addition, the\npresumed stabilizing function of collateral was weakened, since a default by a dealer or clearing bank could\nleave lenders with securities posted as collateral that they had no desire, operational capacity, or even, in some\ncases, legal authority to hold, or at least liquidate in an orderly way.” See “Shadow Banking After the\nFinancial Crisis” available on the Board’s website at the following link:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20120612a.htm.\n\n5\n\nSource: iMoneyNet data\n\n6\n\nFor example, prime money market funds have a significant exposure to short-term debt instruments of\nEuropean banks.\n\n7\n\nIt should be noted that the money market fund industry discloses that investments may lose value and are not\ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n8\n\nMMMF investors are shareholders, not depositors.\n\n9\n\nFor example, heavy redemption pressures may force fire sales of assets that depress net asset values or\nconcentrate losses over a shrinking number of shares.\n\n10\n\nThe Investment Company Institute notes that “money market funds hold more than one-third of corporate\ncommercial paper.” A paper by Sergey Chernenko and Adi Sunderam describes this impact on borrowers of\nmoney market funds in 2011.

In addition, a forthcoming white\npaper detailing our analysis of sponsor support is expected to be published this summer by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston.\n13\n\nThe purchase could be actual or promised. The Boston Fed used actual purchases in its analysis, to be\nconservative. Other studies (such as Moody’s) have also noted promised purchases or guarantees.\n\n14\n\nEven guarantees, which may require no initial cash outlay, result in a recorded liability on the books of the\nsponsor and an associated reduction in sponsor capital.\n\n15\n\nSource: Moody's.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nAt the Sasin Bangkok Forum\non “Asia in Transformation”\n\nJuly 9, 2012\nBangkok, Thailand\n\nIt is a great pleasure to have been invited to participate in this session on financial crises and\nthe future of global and Asian banking. I am particularly honored to be sharing the podium with\nProfessor Takatoshi Ito, whose research interests have paralleled my own in studying the impact of\nbanking problems in Japan; and Dr. Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand and\nthus a colleague in central banking.\nAs always, I should note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nThe important role that financial institutions play in macroeconomic stability – or instability –\nhas been reaffirmed in recent years. Large global banks amplified economic problems in 2007 and\n2008, and contributed to the pervasiveness and severity of the recession experienced around the\nworld. Since that time, many banks have taken the opportunity to improve their capital ratios and\nreduce their risk, and regulators have been focused on achieving a more stable financial system, not\njust on supervision of individual institutions.1\nIndeed, global banks can provide some significant benefits because they are less susceptible to\nlocal economic problems, can introduce state-of-the-art technology and risk management tools, and\nprovide highly competitive rates for firms to finance global trade. Despite enhanced risk-management\nstrategies and the attention many global banks have given to improving their financial resilience,\nthese banks still have the potential to adversely impact2 global financial stability and economic\noutcomes – through their capacity to rapidly amplify and transmit significant financial shocks across\nsovereign and continental borders. So the banks are certainly worthy of the additional study and\nattention they are now receiving.\nToday I plan to briefly cover three related topics. First, I would like to discuss the economic\noutlook, with particular attention to recent economic trends in the United States. Second, I will\nexamine the interconnectedness of global financial institutions. Third, I will briefly review how\nintertwined banking markets showed themselves to be in 2007-2008 – with an eye to what we might\nexpect should we experience a significant financial shock emanating, for example, from Europe.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nBefore talking about these banking issues, I think it is important to provide some economic\ncontext to our discussion. In the U.S., the 2007-2009 recession led to significant excess capacity,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nparticularly in the labor market. Although the unemployment rate has declined since it reached its\npeak in October of 2009, significant excess capacity remains.\nRecent data from both the United States and China are consistent with a slowdown in\neconomic growth, and it looks like Europe is in a recession – with some European countries\nexperiencing sharply negative growth. Based on recent incoming data, many economists have been\ndowngrading their forecasts for the United States. Consistent with this trend, members of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee – which sets monetary policy in the United States – recently released (in\nJune) forecasts for the U.S. economy which show deterioration from the April economic forecast.\nThe projections shown in Figure 1 represent the central tendency of the forecasts provided by\nthe Fed Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The three highest and three lowest\nforecasts are dropped to provide the central tendency. As the figure indicates, the central tendency\nhas shifted, and now reflects an expectation that economic growth will be positive but quite weak.\nConsistent with that forecast, the FOMC participants now expect little improvement over the\nremainder of the year in the unemployment rate from its current level of 8.2 percent. In terms of\ninflation, the expectation is that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will be well below\nour target of 2 percent – with lower oil and commodity prices, a stronger dollar, and very subdued\nlabor costs all contributing to the lower inflation estimate.\nDespite this rather gloomy collective forecast, I actually have been more pessimistic than my\ncolleagues. My forecast for GDP is below the central tendency, my forecast for unemployment is\nabove the central tendency, and my forecast for inflation is at the bottom of the range of the central\ntendency. My pessimism is rooted in an expectation of weakness in investment, net exports, and\ngovernment spending. That weakness is driven in part by concerns about economic and financial\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nconditions in Europe, combined with restrained state and federal government spending as the U.S.\n(like many other countries) grapples with large budget deficits.\nIn particular, my discussions with bankers, exporters, and business managers indicate more\nrestraint by firms in investing in capital, and in hiring employees, as the firms wait for some of the\neconomic uncertainty to be resolved. However, a quick resolution for European sovereign debt\nconcerns and banking problems may remain elusive,3 and the same for the large deficit problems in\nmany countries. This suggests that slow growth is likely to continue for quite some time.\nFigure 2 shows business fixed investment in the United States during the most recent four\nquarters. As you can see, with concerns over Europe heating up in the last two quarters, business\nfixed investment has slowed. Firms have become more tentative, which I expect will, unfortunately,\ncontinue. One reason for my pessimism is the recent weakness in orders for capital goods, for\nexample aircraft.\nIndicating just how weak employment has been, Figure 3 compares the monthly change in\nU.S. employment during the most recent and past three recoveries. As you can see, compared to the\naverage of the last three recoveries, employment data have come in quite weak. Employment growth\nis slower now – in the third year of recovery – than it has been at the same point in any of the\nprevious three recoveries. In fact, just in the past three months employment growth in the U.S. has\nslowed fairly noticeably. Admittedly, the rate of growth is just one facet of the employment situation\n– employment-level comparisons are important, and currently sobering. I will turn to that a bit later,\nbut for now will just observe that these growth rate indicators are not a positive sign. Apparently,\nfirms have become more tentative in the face of growing global economic uncertainties. The\nslowdown in employment growth not only hinders our ability to get to full employment, but also\nweakens the consumer side of the economy even more, going forward. This suggests a self-fulfilling\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\ndynamic at work as concern over a potentially significant slowdown in the future reduces current\ngrowth, as firms invest less capital and hire fewer workers than they would in the absence of these\nuncertainties.\n\nBanking Interconnectedness\nGiven my concerns that economic growth will disappoint, what are the implications for global\nbanking? I would highlight first the high degree of interconnectedness between and among global\nbanks, particularly among U.S. and European banks. In New England, where I reside, three of the\nfive largest banks active in the region are foreign – from the U.K., Canada, and Spain. This is not just\na New England feature, as foreign and in particular European banks are very active in both retail and\nwholesale markets throughout the United States.\nFigure 4 lists the ten largest foreign banking organizations in the United States by total U.S.\nassets. Five are European banks, three are Canadian, and two are Japanese. Several of the largest\nbanking organizations have subsidiaries that have substantial retail franchises in the United States. In\naddition, the total assets of branches and agencies of three of the banks exceed $100 billion, likely\nindicating very significant “wholesale” operations, since most branches and agencies have virtually\nno retail deposit accounts in the United States because they cannot be FDIC insured.\nWhile several Japanese banks have had a significant presence in the United States, their role\nhas diminished over the past 15 years. And no other Asian banks are among the largest banks\noperating in the U.S.\nFigure 5 presents the assets of the ten largest U.S. broker-dealers owned by foreign banking\norganizations. The chart shows that European firms have a very significant presence in the United\nStates. The six largest foreign-owned broker-dealers are all European, and all have assets over $100\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nbillion. These foreign-owned broker-dealers provide a variety of market-making and underwriting\nactivity. This means that many European banks are highly interconnected with the U.S. financial\nsystem. Again, with the exception of one Japanese bank, the Asian bank presence in the U.S. is not\nnearly as significant as the European presence.\nFigure 6 plots some broad stock indices for the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan. The indices\nfor the U.S. and Europe move very closely together throughout the crisis period – and while they\ncontinue to move closely together, more recently the European index has drifted lower. In contrast,\nwhile all the stock indices experienced sharp declines in the fall of 2008, over time the Asian indices\nare generally not as tightly connected with those of the U.S. and Europe.\nFigure 7 plots the 26-week trailing correlation of U.S. and European stock index returns over\nthe last six years. The chart shows a very high and consistent correlation between the stock indices,\nindicating a very close link between U.S. and European markets. Figure 8 plots the 26-week trailing\ncorrelation of the returns of U.S. and European bank stocks. They too show a high degree of\ncorrelation, which has remained relatively stable. Given the close trade and financial ties between the\nU.S. and Europe, this may not be surprising.\nEuropean stocks were badly impacted by the financial shock from the U.S. during the last\nfinancial crisis. Were there to be a serious financial shock from Europe, these correlations suggest it\nis quite likely that it would have a large impact on financial stocks and the broader stock market in the\nUnited States. Such stock price declines could impact households and businesses on both sides of the\nAtlantic, and problems in Europe could potentially cause a more significant retrenchment by\nEuropean financial institutions operating in the United States.4\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nWhat about Asia?\nAs I mentioned earlier, historically Asian banks have not been as integrated with the United\nStates as European banks. While Asian banks have certainly been impacted by the global slowdown\nand reduction in international trade, their lesser degree of interconnectedness compared to European\nbanks means one might not expect to see as tight a link to financial problems emanating from the\nUnited States for Asian banks.\nFigures 9 and 10 show the correlations between U.S. large (global) bank stock returns and\nthose of Japan and China. During the early stages of the financial crisis in 2007, there was a very low\ncorrelation between bank stock returns in the United States and Asia. However, that correlation has\nrisen over time, although it still remains below the correlation between U.S. and European global\nbanks.\nFigures 11 and 12 show the correlations between European bank stock returns and those of\nglobal banks in Japan and China. They also have been rising over time. These rising stock return\ncorrelations may in part reflect a rising degree of interconnectedness between Asian financial\ninstitutions and their U.S. and European counterparts over the last six years.\nThe Bank for International Settlements provides data that highlight why the correlations may\nbe increasing. Figure 13 shows that U.S. and U.K. banks have been increasing their presence in Asia\nand that other European banks have significant exposures as well.5,6\nTurning to exposures to Europe, Figure 14 shows that U.S. banks have increased their claims7\nin Europe. This raises the possibility that the correlation between returns in the U.S. and Europe\ncould be nearly as tight in the event of a European disruption as they proved to be during the U.S.\nfinancial crisis. Only Japan and Taiwan currently provide data on foreign claims in Europe, but they\nalso are at relatively high levels. It should be noted that both in this graph and the previous, the\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nconversion of two investment banks into bank holding companies causes a significant break in the\nU.S. series in the first quarter of 2009 – most noticeable on Figure 14 where there is a sharp increase\nin that period. Nonetheless, even after accounting for that break, the trend is the same, and the level\nof exposure is quite high.\nIn sum, while Asian banks did not have a high correlation with U.S. and European bank stock\nreturns during 2007 and early 2008, Asian banks are likely to be more impacted now should a\nsignificant shock occur in Europe. European bank presence in Asia has been rising, and Japan and\nTaiwan have relatively large claims in Europe.8 In short, I would say that as interconnectedness\nincreases globally, it will be difficult for any one region to insulate itself from financial strains or\ncrises elsewhere in the world.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that recent data have been consistent with a\nslowdown in economic activity in many parts of the world. This likely reflects a widespread concern\nthat global trade may be disrupted if there is an international financial shock, and that businesses are\npostponing hiring and investment decisions until the global outlook is more certain.\nWhile a large financial shock would impact the global economy, global banks have the\npotential to amplify that shock. While Asian global banks’ stock returns were not highly correlated\nwith those of U.S. and European global banks in the last crisis, the correlation has been on the rise\nover the past six years. Beyond the obvious trade impact if problems were to get worse in Europe, the\nconcern is increased due to financial markets and global banks becoming more interconnected.\nFigure 15 compares employment from its pre-recession peak in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\nWhile U.S. employment has been gradually increasing during the recovery, it remains well below the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\npre-recession peak. While the declines in Europe and Japan were not as dramatic, there has been little\nimprovement overall in the employment situation during the recovery. Given global employment and\nfiscal challenges, the global economy remains quite vulnerable to financial shocks. This vulnerability\nhighlights why it is particularly important at this time to reduce the probability, and mitigate the\nseverity, of any potential financial shock.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThat is, macroprudential in addition to just microprudential supervision.\n\n2\n\nAnd, of course, be impacted by.\n\n3\n\nEncouraging signs did emerge in the last ten days. As The New York Times reported, “This week’s economic summit\namong European leaders has exceeded expectations. New ground has been broken in an agreement that would allow\nEurope’s joint rescue funds to be used to recapitalize struggling banks in European Union member states and that would\nestablish a single bank supervisory mechanism under the European Central Bank.” June 29, 2012:\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html?_r=1&ref=world\n4\n\nOf course, the patterns of exposure in European versus U.S. banks would have an impact on how such a retrenchment\nplayed out. European banks clearly held mortgage-related assets and other assets that were sensitive to U.S. disruption.\nThe degree and manner in which U.S. banks hold assets that would be sensitive to European disruption could differ.\nHowever, later in this talk I discuss correlation and with Figure 14 I note that U.S. claims on European assets have risen.\n5\n\nIt also highlights that European banks have larger overall claims in Asia than U.S. banks.\n\n6\n\nAmong European countries, the U.K. has been increasing its presence in Asia, while other European countries have\nreduced their presence. Among European countries, the U.K. presence is slightly higher than that of the rest of Europe\ncombined.\n7\n\nClaims include loans, securities holdings, and equity holdings, and reflect the bank’s foreign exposure to that country.\nClaims include exposures held in the home country bank, as well as those held in branches or subsidiaries in the host\ncountry.\n8\n\nOne major transmission mechanism for a European financial shock would be through contagion associated with the\nassessment of risk in general. A significant rise in the risk spreads in the U.S. need not be a bank phenomenon (it could\njust be rising common exposures – everyone at risk is increasingly at risk from a global downturn), but it could have large\nreal effects.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSouth Shore Chamber of Commerce\nQuincy, Massachusetts\nSeptember 20, 2012\n\nGood morning and thank you for the opportunity to be with you at the South\nShore Chamber of Commerce.\nAs always, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nI know it’s still early morning, but allow me to start with an observation about\neconomists, historians, and the word “Great.” Historians tend to use “Great” to reflect\nsuccess, particularly military success that results in territorial expansion – think\nAlexander the Great or Peter the Great. In economics, “Great” is used quite differently.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIt’s usually applied to difficult episodes with serious economic consequences – think of\nthe Great Depression or the so-called Great Recession. Often such an episode involves\neconomic policymaking – fiscal, monetary, or otherwise – that contributes to the situation\nor fails to alleviate it.\nI have titled this talk \"Acting to Avoid a Great Stagnation” and let me be clear, I\ndo believe the Federal Reserve is taking appropriate and forceful action to help the U.S.\navoid a prolonged economic stagnation.\nLet me explain the terms. In my view a Great Stagnation – in current times or any\nother – would be a long episode that generally includes a willingness among\npolicymakers to accept as inevitable, and decline to resist, far-less-than-optimal\noutcomes. Such outcomes could include higher unemployment, with the potential result\nthat high unemployment could become entrenched as a more permanent feature of the\neconomic landscape. 1\nWhat I am highlighting is the importance and appropriateness of taking the policy\nactions that are necessary to improve economic conditions much more quickly – so the\nperiod of very slow recovery that we have been experiencing of late does not persist and\nbecome a Great Stagnation or in fact a “Great” anything.\nUnfortunately, the global economy is experiencing a slowdown, and that\nslowdown is one of the significant impediments to faster growth in the domestic\neconomy. Failure to react to this slowdown would risk a situation where difficult\nconditions prevail for long enough to become “Great” in the economist’s sense. This\ncould occur if policymakers of all sorts – monetary, fiscal, economic, and financial –\nwere to adopt a stance of only reacting to large negative shocks, while accepting (and\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndeclining to act against) a status quo of substantial underutilization of resources, for an\nextended period of time.\nThis sort of scenario would be particularly tragic in the job market, and I would\nnote that over the course of this year there has been no meaningful improvement in the\nunacceptably high level of the U.S. unemployment rate. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke\nhas called this a “grave concern” and I fully agree with him.\nLast week the group charged with monetary policymaking in the U.S., the\nFOMC, took additional monetary policy actions to promote faster economic growth. I\nfully support the policy actions. Let me say a bit about them. First, the FOMC noted that\nit anticipates that low short-term rates are likely to be warranted at least through mid2015. This guidance makes clear that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a\nconsiderable time, likely even after labor markets improve from their current subdued\nstate, in order to promote a robust and sustainable recovery.\nSecond, given the desire to increase policy accommodation even while the\ntraditional policy instrument (the federal funds rate) is at the zero lower bound, the\nFOMC announced plans to buy $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities a month\n– until such time as there is substantial ongoing improvement in labor markets. The more\nopen-ended nature of the action – intending to continue such purchases until labor\nmarkets have improved – is an important change. Of course, the Fed will do so in the\ncontext of price stability (which is the other half of the Fed’s “dual mandate,” along with\nmaximum sustainable employment) – and hand in hand with a careful ongoing\nassessment of the program’s costs and efficacy.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOf course policy actions such as these are unconventional, and do entail risks.\nHowever, in my view the risks involved in pursuing these policies are considerably\nsmaller and more manageable than the risk of allowing the economy to stagnate for\nanother year or more.\nThe U.S. has seen a series of “false starts” during this recovery. After earlier\nperiods of policy accommodation the economy has improved, but that improvement has\nnot been sustained. These false starts have been interrupted by both natural and manmade disasters, here and abroad. As a consequence of these interruptions, the recovery\nhas been painfully slow by historical standards – resulting in our current highly-elevated\nunemployment rate and an inflation rate below our objective.\nAbsent further policy action, most economists expect several more years of weak\nlabor markets and low inflation. As a consequence, it was time for the Fed to announce\nstimulus that will continue until the U.S. achieves both faster economic growth and lower\nunemployment, no matter the unanticipated interruptions.\nToday I would like to walk through my analysis of the economic situation in more\ndetail. In doing so I hope it will become clear why I have strongly supported the kind of\nforceful action that the FOMC took last week. In my view, these policies are essential to\nachieving a strong sustainable recovery that is resilient, despite the inevitable disruptions.\nLet me add that I am only discussing monetary policy, not fiscal policy, since fiscal\npolicy, though powerful, is not in the Fed’s jurisdiction.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAvoiding a Stagnation\nFigure 1 provides a powerful real-world example of the potential for a Great\nStagnation – the experience of Japan after their financial crisis, which began in 1990.\nWhile this period is sometimes called the “Lost Decade,” that is actually a misnomer –\nsince the period of stagnant growth has lasted over two decades.\nThere are many factors contributing to a Great Stagnation in Japan, including a\nvery slow realization of the need to recapitalize banks, and a population whose average\nage is rapidly rising (which changes the composition of economic activity in a country),\nand a substantial slowdown in population growth. Still, it is striking that there was a\ndramatic change in the growth of real GDP in Japan coinciding with the start of their\nfinancial crisis. 2 The muted policy response to the slower growth that began during the\nfinancial crisis is partly responsible for the fact that Japanese growth never returned to its\npre-crisis rate, or to where output would have been had the crisis not occurred (the path\nillustrated by the trend line, based on growth over the 1980-1990 period).\nFigure 2 shows the level of U.S. GDP since 1980. Note that we too have a\nnoticeable break in the growth rate of GDP at the advent of the recent financial crisis.\nHowever, unlike the Japanese, it appears that we have resumed the pre-crisis growth rate.\nBut we have not returned the economy back to its original growth path, the only time we\nhave failed to do so in all ten of our other post-war recessions – including the severe\nrecession in 1982.\nFailing to return quickly to the original trend line is much more serious than a\ngraph can convey. It implies a significant cumulative loss in goods and services that\nshould have been produced (measured as the sum of the difference between those two\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlines), which in turn implies a significant shortfall in employment relative to full\nemployment.\nAs a result, the goal of monetary and fiscal policy should be to return the\neconomy back to the original trend line. This means getting faster than normal growth\nuntil resources are once again fully utilized. A risk in not doing so is that we\npermanently reduce our trend growth rate, which is what appears to have happened in\nJapan.\n\nCauses of Slow Growth in the United States\nExploring in detail the many possible causes of slow growth in the current\neconomy is beyond the scope of this talk. But let me just highlight some important\nfactors. Figure 3 shows, and compares, the growth rates of real GDP and real GDP\nexcluding residential investment (housing) and government spending. As the chart\nshows, there is a notable difference in the growth rates. While real GDP has grown only\nby 2.21 percent, real GDP excluding housing and government spending grew by 2.45\npercent. Had the economy not had the headwinds from government and housing\ndragging growth lower – had it grown just by that higher rate of 2.45 percent over the\nthree years of the recovery – outcomes would be somewhat better. However, normally a\nsector like housing would be expected to grow much more quickly than other sectors of\nthe economy in the early stages of a recovery – given housing's interest-rate sensitivity –\nand thus we would expect it to provide more impetus to overall economic growth.\nTo consider the role of housing a bit more, Figure 4 shows housing starts from\n2000 onward. The decline in housing starts is striking, and unlike in most other\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecoveries the housing sector did not participate in the initial stages of the current\nrecovery – although there has been some improvement recently.\nHowever, I think there are some reasons to believe the recent nascent signs of a\nhousing recovery might be durable. Since the onset of the housing bust the population\nhas grown and per capita income has grown, while interest rates are very low and prices\nare more affordable. These are all positives when it comes to having potential buyers\nready to purchase homes.\nThese circumstances make it an important time for policymakers to consider\nadditional stimulus to the housing market to finally induce progress. Consider the market\npsychology: if home buyers feel that house prices are on the rise (as many indicators\nsuggest), and that mortgage rates will only remain this low temporarily, we could see new\nhome buyers come off the sidelines and commit to purchase new homes before rates rise\nand before house prices rise further than they have.\nAlso, Figure 5 shows growth in state and local government spending since 2000\nand highlights that it has been unusually weak in this recovery. This is, in large part, a\nresult of state and local governments pulling back in response to greatly diminished\nrevenues – a direct consequence of the depth of the recession and the weakness of the\nrecovery. Many states were prepared for a revenue shortfall, having accumulated “rainy\nday” funds, but the long downturn sapped those funds. Since nationally, the sum of state\nand local government spending is larger than federal spending 3, the net impact has been\nthat government-sector spending has been a significant drag on growth during the\nrecovery.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 6 highlights another force dragging on the U.S. recovery, the global\neconomic slowdown. Many advanced economies experienced a deeper recession (as\nmeasured by output) than did the United States, and countries such as the U.K., France,\nand Japan have real GDP levels indexed below where they were at the end of 2007, an\neven weaker rebound than in the United States. Furthermore, in the last several quarters\nseveral of the advanced economies in Europe have actually been in decline as they have\nslashed their government spending.\n\nCosts of a Slow Recovery\nA slow recovery can have significant costs. Allow me to show you some charts\nthat are compelling – acknowledging, of course, that charts cannot convey the human toll\nof the situation they depict.\nFigure 7 shows the ratio of employment to population, which has remained very\nflat during the recovery. This is consistent with the growth in GDP being only about 2\npercent – which is enough to keep up with the growth in productivity and the labor force\nbut not leading to the employment of a larger percent of the population. By the way,\nwhile there have been some demographic shifts within the workforce that might explain\nsome decline in the employment-to-population ratio, they do not explain the trend in\nFigure 7; indeed, a very similar pattern emerges when looking at the employment-topopulation ratio for particular age groups.\nFigure 8 shows one of the painful and unusual features of this recession and\nrecovery, the very elevated percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for\nmore than six months. Unlike the deep recession in 1982, in which there was a quick\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecovery and as a result a relatively small and short-lived increase in long-duration\nunemployment, the last recession and long, weak recovery have resulted in substantially\nmore people suffering long spells of unemployment. Long periods of unemployment\nfrequently deplete the savings of the unemployed, make re-employment harder (as\nemployers may be tentative about hiring those who have been unemployed for long\nperiods of time), and may lead to skills becoming less than current. These problems\nhighlight why it is important to generate faster growth to avoid what some call labor\nmarket “scarring” – where long-duration unemployment becomes ingrained into our labor\nmarket.\n\nWhat Should Monetary Policymakers Do?\nThe Great Stagnation in Japan did lead to a monetary policy response from the\nJapanese central bank. The Bank of Japan eased rates until they hit the zero lower bound,\nand then as Figure 9 shows, began to gradually expand the assets of the central bank.\nHowever, there were key differences from the policy actions we have taken at the\nFederal Reserve. The Bank of Japan only gradually expanded the assets on its balance\nsheet, and only after a delay of a number of years. Many of its purchases were of shortterm securities, which had little impact on already-low short-term rates. This is in\ncontrast to the impact that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s purchases of longer-duration assets\nhave had on longer-term rates, which remain well above zero and thus have room to\ndecline.\nFinally, the Japanese central bank may in my view have prematurely stopped the\ngrowth in their balance sheet, considering the weakness in the Japanese economy at the\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntime. As a result, the Japanese economy has remained stagnant and despite having an\nexpanded balance sheet for an extended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a\ndeflation problem rather than an inflation problem, as the bottom chart on Figure 9\nshows.\nTurning to the U.S., the differences in policy are quite striking. There was a rapid\nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet (see Figure 10), as well as a fiscal stimulus. This\nmay be why we have not experienced a significant decline in the trend growth rate in the\neconomy, seen in an earlier chart. There has also been a focus on bringing long-term\ninterest rates down, and more recently on utilizing monetary policy communication\nstrategies to convey that rates will likely remain low until the recovery and labor markets\nshow a more sustained improvement.\nTo reiterate, a key difference is that we didn’t hesitate (by years) to take\nsignificant actions in the U.S. And when we took actions, they were forceful. And going\nforward, we also don’t want to make the mistake of retreating at the first, early signs of\nimprovement. Japan’s experience suggests one must continue until improvement is\nsustainable and will persist.\nHowever, despite these differences there is an important similarity between our\nsituation and Japan’s, as well. Just as Japan has not experienced inflation despite a rapid\nexpansion of their balance sheet, our measure of inflation (the personal consumption\nexpenditure deflator) is currently only 1.3 percent through July despite our balance sheet\nexpanding significantly four years ago (see the bottom chart on Figure 10).\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRecent Actions\nLast Thursday the FOMC announced several new policies, summarized in the\nnext two slides. The Fed announced a number of important policy changes.\nFirst, in addition to exchanging (as previously announced) $45 billion of shortterm Treasury securities for an equal amount of long-term Treasury bonds through the\nmaturity extension program running through December, the Fed will purchase $40 billion\na month in agency mortgage backed securities (MBS). These purchases of MBS should\nplace downward pressure on U.S. mortgage rates, which should support the housing\nmarket by lowering borrowing costs and providing additional support for house-prices to\nappreciate from depressed levels. The housing market should be stronger than if these\nactions were not taken.\nSecond, the purchases of agency MBS will likely affect the yields on other,\nsimilar long-term assets, such as Treasury bonds and corporate bonds. Bonds of similar\nmaturity, duration and risk characteristics are viewed as substitutes for MBS by many\ninvestors. Removing some of the MBS from private circulation will create a scarcity of\nlong-maturity, lower-risk securities. This shortage will lower both MBS and other longterm interest rates in the marketplace, with effects that are qualitatively similar to the\neffects we have when we lower the federal funds rate (something we cannot do now, as it\nis at the zero lower bound). As a consequence, our policy will have effects on a broad\narray of economic activity beyond the direct effects on residential investment.\nThird, I would note that the plan to purchase MBS securities is open-ended. As\nthe FOMC indicated in its statement last week, the MBS purchases and potentially the\nuse of other tools will continue until there has been improvement in labor markets. This\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmeans the policy actions are being conditioned on an economic outcome rather than a set\ntimeframe. This should provide market participants confidence that the Federal Reserve\nwill do what it takes to improve economic outcomes.\nFourth, highly accommodative policy will continue for a considerable time after\nthe economic recovery strengthens. This means that we will ensure the economy is truly\nstrengthening before raising interest rates. Highly accommodative policy is currently\nlikely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\n\nThe Initial Impact of Policy Actions\nThe table shown in Figure 11 provides some estimates of the financial impacts of\nthe Fed’s recent policy announcement. Such impacts are difficult to measure with any\nprecision, given anticipation about our possible actions built into markets, and the reality\nthat other events can occur coincident with the action.\nStill, for reference the first column provides the financial market response when\nthe FOMC announcement was made. The second column extends the period to Thursday\nand Friday as financial market participants had more time to analyze the policy change\nand Chairman Bernanke’s press conference explaining the announcement. The third\ncolumn begins the financial response at the Chairman’s August speech at the Jackson\nHole conference, which was widely viewed as increasing the likelihood of a more\nforceful easing, though the specifics were not known. The final column dates the event\nfrom the prior FOMC meeting, when most observers interpreted the statement as making\nfurther forceful action more likely.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile this table shows a range of impacts, I would say in sum that regardless of\nthe event window chosen, stock prices are up substantially, mortgage rates are lower, and\nexchange rates are lower. On the latter I would point out that our efforts to lower long\nrates are focused on stimulating domestic demand, but at the same time lower long-term\nrates affect demand for U.S. assets, resulting in a modest change in the exchange rate –\nand this is likely to provide some support for export-oriented industries.\nAll of these impacts are very consistent with what we would expect of the\nmonetary transmission “channels” of purchasing mortgage backed securities and\nproviding additional forward guidance on policy. In fact, they are also quite consistent\nwith the transmission channel that we expect when conducting “normal” – i.e. federal\nfunds rate – monetary policy when we are not constrained by the zero lower bound.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve last week provide significant\nadditional support to the economic recovery. They should result in stronger economic\ngrowth, and return us to full employment more quickly than would be the case absent the\npolicies.\nHowever, monetary policy is not a panacea. Appropriate fiscal policies\ndomestically, and improvement in the global economy could both provide significant\npositive effects, and shorten the time needed for unconventional monetary policy actions\nlike those we have announced. In addition, it is important to note that significant fiscal\npolicy mistakes, such as an unlikely failure to address the looming “fiscal cliff” in the\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nU.S., would have effects on economic growth that would be difficult to fully offset with\nmonetary policy.\nIt is my firm belief that the monetary policy actions taken last week should\ncontribute to a faster economic recovery and a more rapid improvement in labor markets\nthan we would have seen in their absence. However, I want to be careful not to appear to\npromise too much, as there are limits to the effects of monetary policy. Even with these\nactions, and assuming no additional negative shocks domestically or internationally, it\nwill still be several years before we are likely to return to full employment.\nWhile that is not an especially upbeat sentiment on which to end my remarks, I\nthink it underlines the importance of our taking action. A very challenging economic\nclimate confronts us all, but I am very pleased that monetary policymakers in the U.S. are\nproving willing to take difficult actions like these rather than accept the possibility of a\nlong, slow recovery turning into a stagnation that someday earns the dubious title of\n“Great.” Japan’s experience is a sobering real-world reminder of why forceful and timely\naction is appropriate.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nRecent examples of a Great Stagnation include Japan, as I will discuss in this talk, and the dynamic in\nsome European countries that experience high rates of unemployment and lagging job creation even during\nperiods of growth – a dynamic that some associate with unaffordable social benefit policies and that in\nsome corners is given the moniker “Eurosclerosis.”\n2\n\nI would note that demographic changes occurring in Japan include a gradually shrinking domestic\nworkforce. But I see this as a gradual change that would not explain the abrupt change in the growth-path\nline shown in the chart around the time of Japan’s financial crisis.\n3\n\nState and local government accounted for 63 percent of government spending on average over the period\n2000-2011.\n\n14\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Community Development Advisory Council’s 2012\nRegional Convening\nLawrence, Massachusetts\nSeptember 24, 2012\n\nGood morning and thank you for being part of this conference focused on New\nEngland’s mid-sized cities. The issues and opportunities facing these cities have\nprobably not received enough attention from the full spectrum of policymakers. Today’s\nconference highlights some topics on which the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans to\nfocus over the next several years.\nToday I would like to summarize just why it is so important that there be\nincreased attention to mid-sized cities. Allow me to give you a short preview and then\ncover these points in a bit more detail, and with a close look at some key data.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAs always, I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nI first want to describe the importance of these cities. New England’s mid-sized\ncities – with populations between 75,000 and 200,000 people – taken together have a\npopulation roughly similar to that of Greater Boston, 1 which represents New England’s\nlargest and most economically vibrant urban area.\nHowever, the mid-sized cities differ in important ways from Boston. They have\nnot seen the same degree of economic vibrancy as residents in Greater Boston, but they\ndo encompass an important source of future growth, in a couple of ways. One, they\nfrequently serve as an entry point for new immigrants, and two, they have on average a\nyounger population than the rest of New England.\nSecond, I want to highlight today the recent economic trends in these cities.\nCertainly these cities have struggled over the past several decades. Their manufacturing\nbase has shrunk, and many have yet to replace lost jobs with new and innovative sectors.\nAs more middle-class families have moved away, these cities face greater challenges in\nhelping their residents acquire the skills and job market opportunities they need to escape\nfrom poverty. While all of these mid-sized cities have struggled and continue to struggle\nto overcome serious obstacles, the economic data indicate that some have done better\nthan others in turning around their economies. It is this revitalization – relative\nresurgence (using indicators such as median family income, poverty rates, and population\ngrowth) – that we all want to see replicated in those cities that are having difficulties\nreengineering themselves.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinally I want to emphasize that I think these cities can indeed become resurgent\ncities. The Boston Federal Reserve Bank staff has done some thoughtful research in this\narea, and has been actively engaged with people like you, in this room, to consider how\nto generate more revitalization in cities in New England. This conference and our future\nwork in this area will, we hope, be of assistance. At the Bank we will continue to look at\nways that we can help – through quantitative and qualitative research, outreach,\ninformation gathering and dissemination, and our ability to convene stakeholders. I hope\nthat together with people like you, gathered here today, we can see more concentrated\nfocus on New England’s mid-sized cities, and more achievement.\n\nThe Importance of Mid-Sized Cities\nLet me say a bit more about the importance of mid-sized cities. Figure 1 tells us\nabout the aggregate population of the New England’s mid-sized cities compared to the\nregion as a whole and to Greater Boston. The cities between 75,000 and 200,000 people 2\nhave, taken together, an aggregate population of 2.2 million people – just a little smaller\nthan the 2.3 million people living in the greater Boston area. So, taken together, roughly\na third of all New Englanders (about 4.5 million people) live in either the Greater Boston\nmetropolitan area or in one of New England’s mid-sized cities.\nIn Massachusetts, legislation defined “gateway cities” as those between 35,000\nand 250,000 people that also fall below the statewide average for income and education. 3\nThese 24 cities as a group account for 1.7 million people. Together, the population in the\nGreater Boston metropolitan area plus the gateway cities account for almost two-thirds of\nthe population of Massachusetts.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 2 shows that for New England and Massachusetts, the mid-sized cities are\na major entry point for foreign-born residents. While only about 13 percent of the U.S.\npopulation is foreign-born, New England as a whole has an even lower share of foreignborn residents (only about 12 percent). However, when looking at New England midsized cities and the Massachusetts gateway cities, much greater shares of residents are\nforeign-born – about 21 percent, or more than one in five residents. In a region of the\ncountry experiencing relatively slow population growth, immigrants are an important\npotential source of growth in the supply of labor.\nFigure 3 shows that these cities have populations that are on net younger than the\nstate and region. The figure shows the shares of the population below 15 years of age\nand 65 years of age and older. For Massachusetts and New England around 18 percent of\nthe population is below 15 years of age, but New England’s mid-sized cities and\nMassachusetts gateway cities have a bit larger share of their population under 15 years of\nage. The mid-sized cities also have a somewhat lower percentage of their population\nover 65 years of age relative to New England as a whole, and the same is true for the\ngateway cities relative to Massachusetts.\nThe younger overall population and the influx of foreign-born residents into our\nregion’s mid-sized cities can be an important source of potential economic growth.\nHowever, there are some significant impediments to these resources being fully utilized,\nand that will impact whether these mid-sized cities prosper and become sources of\nstrength in the regional economy.\nFor example, Figure 4 shows differences in poverty rates. New England’s midsized cities have a much higher percentage of the population in poverty compared to New\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nEngland more generally. The picture is similar in Massachusetts: the gateway cities have\nmuch higher rates of poverty than the state as a whole. These higher poverty rates are a\nserious impediment if they reflect, or perpetuate, residents of mid-sized cities being less\nlikely to obtain the skills necessary to be gainfully employed in today’s economy.\nTo that end, Figure 5 shows that educational attainment varies greatly across the\nregion. While New England and Massachusetts have much higher educational attainment\nthan the rest of the country, that educational attainment is uneven across the region.\nWhile 46 percent of the population in Greater Boston 4 has a bachelor’s degree or above,\nthe mid-sized cities in New England have a much lower 24.5 percent of their population\nwith a bachelor’s degree or above. The figure is even lower for the Massachusetts\ngateway cities, which have only 22.7 percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree\nor above – less than half the rate of the Greater Boston area.\nIf mid-sized cities are to serve as a potential source of growth for New England’s\neconomy, it is important that the work force be able to acquire the skills and opportunities\nnecessary to succeed. Work force development efforts, and initiatives that provide strong\neducational opportunities for all residents of our mid-sized cities – including new\nimmigrants and their children – are likely to be a key necessity if these cities are to\nflourish.\n\nResurgent cities\nIn recent research covering not only New England, but also the mid-Atlantic,\nMidwest, and upper South, my Boston Fed colleagues Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana\nPatricia Muñoz have worked to identify key factors that set cities apart – in particular,\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nwhat factors make some cities relatively resurgent while other cities do not make similar\nimprovements.\nTheir research shows that even the relatively resurgent cities (those cities that\noutperformed their peers) have had difficulty improving at the same rate as the country as\na whole. Figure 6 reflects median family income in the resurgent cities and in other\ncities, 5 as a share of U.S. median family income, over the last 50 years or so. While the\nmedian family income in cities that were not considered resurgent was only a little above\n60 percent of the median family income of the nation – and declining – the median family\nincome in the relatively resurgent cities was a little above 80 percent of the median\nfamily income of the nation, and still declining although at a lower rate. This highlights\nsome of the challenges facing even the cities that are making progress.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment does seem to be a key factor.\nEducational attainment was significantly better in the resurgent cities than in those cities\nthat were not considered resurgent. 6\nSeparately, I would note that many of New England’s mid-sized cities are along\ncoasts. This provides certain opportunities to the extent that they have port facilities, but\nalso provides opportunities to attract tourists and new residents. Both Providence and\nNew Haven show stronger growth in median household income relative to the U.S. than\nother mid-sized cities since 2000, as Figure 8 shows.\nProvidence, New Haven, and Worcester were the three New England cities\nclassified as resurgent by Kodrzycki and Muñoz. These three cities all have a strong\nacademic presence in their cities, as well as serving as major medical centers.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIndeed, I would note that many of these mid-sized cities, including many that are\nnot yet resurgent, are at the crossroads of transportation hubs, or have become regional\nmedical centers, or have educational institutions as “anchor tenants” in their cities. Many\nmid-sized cities have not yet fully leveraged these potential attributes to attract industries\nand promote growth. Increasingly, medical centers and universities have been shown to\nbe potential development hubs. Worcester has benefited from its focus on the life\nsciences. Cities with colleges and universities that find ways to use those resources to\nfoster development are likely to be among the cities that better succeed over time.\n\nThe “Softer Side” of Development\nOne of the interesting findings in the work of I mentioned by Yolanda Kodrzycki\nand Ana Patricia Muñoz is that one of the main characteristics of the resurgent cities is\nthe presence of collaborative civic leadership. Whether catalyzed by leaders in the\nprivate sector, public sector, or non-profit sector, it seems that the resurgent cities have\ndeveloped a vision for progress that has the shared support of the entire community and a\nvariety of leaders.\nFrequently the cities that have lost important sectors of employment – for\nexample the loss of manufacturing jobs in many New England cities – also lose some of\nthe cohesion in their communities. Charitable and civic organizations benefit from\ncompanies contributing to leadership in the community, so the loss of major firms when a\nsector declines is anything but positive. Civic cohesion and collaboration across political\nlines can also be impacted. And changing demographics in cities can make it more\nchallenging – but no less important – to achieve effective collaboration.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nClearly, a collaborative vision for a community cannot be imposed from the\noutside. It requires residents to engage and find ways to leverage the city’s positive\nattributes for the benefit of all citizens.\nWe hope that this conference serves as a basis for more positive work in this area.\nLet me bring up Figure 9, which lists the cities I have been speaking about this morning.\nWe expect that the mid-sized city issues I’ve touched on will be a focus of our\ncommunity outreach over the next several years, with a particular attention on\ncollaborative civic leadership. I look forward to hearing the ideas of participants, and the\nsuggestions you have on how the Boston Fed can help.\nTogether and with a lot of thoughtful, persistent work I am certain we can build\non the strengths and resources in our region’s mid-sized cities, to see their more rapid\ndevelopment.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nGreater Boston is defined as the group of 75 cities and towns identified by the University of\nMassachusetts’ Donahue Institute along and inside the I-495 corridor and cited as the “Greater Boston\nKnowledge Core” in the MassInc/Brookings Institute study “Reconnecting Massachusetts Gateway Cities:\nLessons Learned and an Agenda for Renewal.” To calculate the population shares, six cities categorized\namong the 24 Gateway cities as defined by the Massachusetts State Legislature (Chelsea, Everett, Lynn,\nMalden, Quincy and Revere), were excluded from the group.\n\n2\n\nDifferent parties use different definitions for smaller cities, gateway cities, and mid-sized cities. We\ndefine mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000,\nexcluding “suburb cities” of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New\nHaven, CT; Norwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA;\nLowell, MA; Lynn, MA; New Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worcester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua,\nNH; Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and Warwick, RI.\n3\n\nThe 24 gateway cities include Barnstable, Brockton, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg,\nHaverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Leominster, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Methuen, New Bedford, Pittsfield,\nQuincy, Revere, Salem, Springfield, Taunton, Westfield, and Worcester. Median income measures and\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\neducational attainment below the statewide average are also part of the definition of the Massachusetts\nGateway Cities. Specifically a gateway municipality is defined as “a municipality with a population\ngreater than 35,000 and less than 250,000, a median household income below the Commonwealth’s\naverage and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or above that is below the\nCommonwealth’s average.”\n4\n\nThis calculation is based on data for Greater Boston cities and towns with population of 20,000 or more as\nthree-year American Community Survey estimates are only available for cities and towns with population\nof 20,000 or more.\n\n5\n\nThe resurgent cities include Evansville, IN; Fort Wayne, IN; Grand Rapids, MI; Greensboro, NC; Jersey\nCity, NJ; New Haven, CT; Peoria, IL; Providence, RI; Winston-Salem, NC; and Worcester, MA. The other\ncities include Akron, OH; Allentown, PA; Bridgeport, CT; Dayton, OH; Erie, PA; Flint, MI; Gary, IN;\nHartford, CT; Paterson, NJ; Rochester, NY; Rockford, IL; South Bend, IN; Springfield, MA; Syracuse,\nNY; Waterbury, CT; and Youngstown, OH.\n\n6\n\nWhile some of the college attainment may have to do with attracting new college educated residents, the\nhigh school attainment figure in particular demonstrates consistent local improvement in education.\n\n9\n\n\f",

        "content": "* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“The Economic Outlook and\nUnconventional Monetary Policy”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBabson College’s\nStephen D. Cutler Center\nfor Investments and Finance\nWellesley, Massachusetts\nNovember 1, 2012\n\nI’m very pleased to be with you today at Babson, a school known for doing a\ngreat job of preparing graduates to face the challenges of the economic landscape.\nRegardless of your area of concentration at Babson, the outlook for the economy is\nrelevant to your studies and, of course, your pursuit of future employment.\nThis year and last, we all experienced real-life frights around Halloween, thanks\nto severe and unusual storms. I’m happy that Hurricane Sandy did not prevent us from\ngetting together today at Babson, but I know our thoughts are with those in our region\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand down the Eastern Seaboard who were so significantly affected by the storm – and\nwho continue the clean-up and recovery process.\nToday I plan to highlight three main points about the economic outlook. I always\nlike to emphasize that my remarks represent my views, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Board of Governors.\nA first point is this: while it is still early to gauge the full impact of the Federal\nReserve’s September monetary policy committee decision to begin an open-ended\nmortgage-backed security purchase program,1 the program has so far worked as expected.\nThe initial response in financial markets was larger than many expected. Given that our\nconventional monetary tool, the fed funds rate, has hit its lower bound of zero, we have\nturned to unconventional monetary policy. By that I mean policy that attempts to affect\nlong-term interest rates directly, via asset purchases,2 rather than indirectly by setting the\nshort-term interest rate, as in conventional policy.\nUnconventional policy has affected financial markets much like movements of\nconventional policy would have. Our use of unconventional policy tools has led to lower\nlonger-term interest rates; higher equity prices; and, in a peripheral by-product of lower\nU.S. rates, exchange-rate effects.\nBy further easing financial conditions, the Fed’s actions appear to be providing\nadditional stimulus to the household sector – as witnessed recently by higher consumer\nconfidence, and increases in purchases of interest-sensitive items such as new homes and\ncars. Certainly, concerns about such issues as the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S. and\nslow growth in many developed countries do appear to be depressing business spending.\nStill, our actions are likely to spur faster economic growth than we would have had\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwithout this additional stimulus – and, as you know, economic growth has been painfully\nslow.\nMy second point is that the increased quantity of bank reserves that resulted from\nthese unconventional monetary policy actions have not resulted in inflation above our 2\npercent target. If you look over a longer period such as from 2000 to the present, total\nPCE3 inflation has averaged 2.2 percent and core PCE inflation4 has averaged 1.9 percent\n– in either case very close to the 2 percent target announced at the beginning of this year.\nThe fact that we continue to undershoot our inflation target while unemployment remains\nhigh is, in my view, a very strong rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative\nstance for monetary policy.\nMy third point is that in addition to stable prices, the Federal Reserve is charged\nwith attaining maximum sustainable employment – what we call our dual mandate, and\nthis has implications for asset-purchase policies (and when to stop them). The statement\nissued after our last policy meeting highlighted that we expect to continue the asset\npurchase program until the economy experiences significant improvement in labor\nmarket conditions. How forcefully and how long to pursue asset purchases is\ncomplicated – by the uncertainty surrounding the effects of unconventional policies; by\nthe usual difficulty in assessing progress toward our dual mandate (given the sometimes\nnoisy signals of both inflationary pressure and labor market conditions); and by the\nreality that the amount of stimulus provided by our asset purchases depends in part on\nmarket participants’ assessment of the likely size of the asset purchase program.5\nThe last complication is the result of the open-ended asset purchase program,\nsince it does not entail a fixed amount or duration of purchases; in this respect it is more\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlike conventional policy in the past. In fact, the decision of when to stop easing during a\nrecovery is a complicated matter even in more normal times, when pursuing conventional\nmonetary policy through changes in the federal funds rate. Importantly, the economic\nconditions associated with the last easing action during a recovery are highly dependent\non the extent of inflationary pressures at the time.\nGiven that the current inflation rate is quite low and is expected to stay low for\nseveral years, we have the flexibility to push for more improvement in labor markets than\nif inflation were not so subdued. My own personal assessment is that as long as inflation\nand inflation expectations are expected to remain well-behaved in the medium term, we\nshould continue to forcefully pursue asset purchases at least until the national\nunemployment rate falls below 7.25 percent and then assess the situation.\nI think of this number as a threshold, not as a trigger – and the distinction is\nimportant. I think of a trigger as a set of conditions that necessarily imply a change in\npolicy. A threshold, unlike a trigger, does not necessarily precipitate a change in policy.\nInstead, I think of my proposed threshold as follows. Once the unemployment rate\ndeclines to this level, we would undertake a full assessment of labor market conditions\nand inflationary pressures to determine whether further asset purchases are consistent\nwith the desired trajectory for reaching our inflation and unemployment mandates in the\nmedium term. Thus, a threshold precipitates a discussion and a more thorough\nassessment of appropriate policy, versus a trigger which starts a change in policy. As an\nexample, suppose we reach one’s threshold unemployment rate but at that time the\neconomy is slowing, and no further improvement in the unemployment rate is expected in\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe short to medium term. This hypothetical situation would not necessarily imply a\nchange in policy stance, especially if inflation was projected to remain below target.\nLet me say also that an unemployment rate of 7.25 sounds high, but achieving an\nunemployment rate of 7.25 percent would require real GDP growth of roughly 3 percent\nfor a year. That would be growth that is a full percentage point faster than the economy’s\nso-called “potential” rate of growth, making this a challenge to achieve.\nAnd as I noted, this is a threshold, not a trigger – at the 7.25 percent threshold the\nassessment of continued asset purchases would commence. It is worth noting that a\nvariety of factors outside the realm of monetary policy (for example demographics) affect\nhow low unemployment can get without igniting inflationary pressures.6 But my own\npersonal view is that if inflationary pressures remain muted, then labor market conditions\nwould need to be more like 6.5 percent unemployment to warrant the federal funds rate\nbeing lifted off the zero bound.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me say a bit about the economic context and outlook. We\nare in the third year of the recovery, and the economy has averaged close to 2 percent\ngrowth over that time, which is faster than many other advanced economies but too slow\nto return the nation to anything like full employment anytime soon.\nTo promote faster growth, with the hope of speeding up improvement in labor\nmarkets, the Federal Reserve announced additional monetary accommodation at our\nSeptember 2012 policy meeting.7 Three key aspects of the announcement were the\ncontinuation of our approach to exchanging short-term securities for long-term securities\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthrough December (the maturity extension program), the plan to purchase $40 billion in\nmortgage-backed securities each month until significant improvement in labor markets is\nachieved, and the indication that short-term rates are expected to remain exceptionally\nlow through mid-2015.\nNow I would like to say a bit more about each of my three main points – the\neffect of unconventional policy, the inflation outlook, and the dual mandate and its\nimplications for asset purchase policies.\n\nPoint #1: The Effect of Unconventional Policy\nGiven both the July statement of the policy committee, and Chairman Bernanke’s\nAugust speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, there was a good deal\nof anticipation in financial markets that more forceful policy action would be taken.8\nBoth were interpreted as indicating a likelihood of further action.\nAs Figure 1 shows, many financial markets began moving well before the\nSeptember announcement – and by the time of the actual announcement stock prices had\nrisen, mortgage rates had fallen, corporate bond rates had fallen, and exchange rates had\ndeclined modestly (a peripheral by-product of lower U.S. rates). Such movements in\nfinancial markets are quite consistent with the normal reaction to conventional monetary\npolicy announcements.\nThe effect of policy on longer-term rates seems in turn to be having a positive\nimpact on the economy. To affect growth in the economy, financial market movements\nneed to encourage firms and households to adjust their behavior. Of course, while it\nremains too early to fully assess the effect of our September action, households appear to\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbe reacting to the easing in financial conditions. Figure 2 shows the four-week moving\naverage of mortgage loan applications. One line reflects the refinance index, which has\nclearly been trending up recently. Even more encouraging has been the increase in the\npurchase index. The drop in mortgage rates at this time has the potential to be\nparticularly effective given that housing prices in some regions of the country are\nbeginning to rise. That, coupled with the risk that rates will rise once the purchase\nprogram is over, provides incentives not to defer purchase decisions.\nFigure 3 shows that this increased activity is beginning to generate new home\nconstruction, as housing starts have been trending up recently. This is consistent with the\nmore qualitative anecdotes I hear from bankers around New England – that they are\nseeing, and are willing to lend to, strong construction firms that are selling new homes\nonce they are built.\nThere are, of course, other channels that transmit the Fed’s action to the economy.\nUnconventional monetary policy actions have produced strength in several interest-ratesensitive sectors since they began in earnest – building on the earlier moves to quickly\nmake policy accommodative as the financial crisis and recession unfolded, and to keep\npolicy accommodative in light of a very tepid recovery. Figure 4 shows that auto loan\nrates at commercial banks also have been declining. The low cost of financing cars,\nalong with positive wealth effects from increases in housing prices and stock prices, have\nhelped to stimulate more robust auto sales – as you can see in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows that consumer durables have been stronger in this recovery than\nduring the previous two recoveries. This is despite a very weak housing market which\npresumably limited many durable goods purchases commonly associated with home\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbuying. Despite this significant “headwind,” I think we can say that the accommodative\nstance of monetary policy and indeed the use of unconventional monetary policy have\nhelped make interest-sensitive consumer durable purchases more affordable.\nWhile the household sector has been responding to monetary policy actions, the\nresponse by businesses has been more muted. Firms appear to be deferring decisions\nuntil they have better clarity on the U.S. fiscal situation and on the likely path of\ninternational economic conditions. However, a continued household sector rebound is\nlikely to improve demand and business conditions, encouraging more business\ninvestment – particularly once some of these downside risks and uncertainties are\nresolved.\n\nPoint #2: The Inflation Outlook\nOne of the concerns voiced about unconventional monetary policy is that\nexpanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet – injecting large quantities of reserves into\nthe banking system – could be inflationary. Let’s look to the data to assess this concern.\nFigure 7 provides a measure of inflation – changes in the total personal\nconsumption expenditure price index for the period since 2000. The average of yearover-year changes in the PCE price index has been 2.2 percent, quite close to our 2\npercent target. However, it has been quite variable over the period, with PCE inflation\nsignificantly exceeding 3 percent during some periods and actually turning negative in\nthe midst of the Great Recession. This volatility is partly attributed to periods of food\nand energy shocks, where price movements have tended to be sharp but temporary.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 provides the changes in the personal consumption expenditure price\nindex removing these volatile food and energy components. To be sure, the Fed is\nconcerned about inflation including these components, as food and energy constitute an\nimportant share of essential household expenditures for people. But temporary\nmovements in these components can obscure the underlying trend in overall inflation, so\nit can be useful to look at the inflation rate taking out food and energy. Over this period,\nthe core PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.9 percent, which is slightly below our 2\npercent target for total PCE inflation. And you can see that the core inflation measure\nhas been far less volatile, remaining in a range between 1 and 3 percent.\nFigure 9 shows both PCE and Core PCE inflation expressed as quarterly changes\nat annual rates. Over the past 12 years there have been a large number of quarters in\nwhich inflation has exceeded 2 percent – thus 2 percent has never been a “ceiling” for\ninflation. The distribution of quarterly core PCE inflation shows many fewer extreme\nobservations, but nonetheless has exhibited a fairly broad range of outcomes. So while\nrecent history has seen an underlying rate of inflation that is relatively stable around our\ntarget, I would suggest that attempting to hold actual inflation in lockstep with our 2\npercent target over short timeframes is probably not realistic.\nBeyond the U.S. situation, I would also point to Japan’s experience as instructive.\nAs I have pointed out many times, despite having an expanded balance sheet for an\nextended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a deflation problem rather than an\ninflation problem. 9\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nPoint #3: The Implications for Asset Purchase Policies\nThe Fed’s recently announced, unconventional asset purchase policies do seem to\nbe having the desired effects, and the inflation rate remains below our 2 percent target.\nHowever, this policy action included the announcement that asset purchases will continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. In other words, the policy\naction is open-ended versus time-bound. Should the economy experience another shock\n– say from a U.S. “fiscal cliff” situation or a shock from abroad, then we could lengthen\nthe period of purchases or increase the amounts (or both). Similarly, favorable shocks\nwould mean that we would purchase fewer securities.\nThe open-ended approach is particularly useful to convey that monetary policy\nwill serve as an “automatic stabilizer” should shocks occur – one hopes at least mitigating\npossible shocks that could buffet the economy. I say “mitigating” because monetary\npolicy would not necessarily be able to fully and immediately offset large shocks.\nAs with conventional monetary policy, decisions about the ideal timing for ending\nunconventional monetary stimulus require balancing a variety of considerations. Figure\n10 shows the economic conditions at the end of the easing cycle for the last three\nrecessions. The end of the easing cycle in 1992 started despite weak labor markets, in\npart because of the high inflation rate at the time. The end of the easing cycle in 2001\noccurred when the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.1 percent, in part because inflation\nwas only 1.9 percent at the time.\nThe figure highlights that ending a cycle of easing during a recovery is highly\ndependent on a variety of economic factors. With lower inflation rates, it is possible to\nmaintain the easing until the labor market shows more significant improvement. This\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwould be consistent with a balanced approach to both elements of the Fed’s dual\nmandate.\nThe variables actually considered by policymakers are much broader than the\nvariables reflected in Figure 10. No single variable perfectly captures the underlying rate\nof inflation, as the sharp differences between core and total PCE indicate. Similarly, no\nsingle variable perfectly captures conditions in the labor market – for example,\nunemployment rates can fall because workers become discouraged and leave the labor\nforce, or because of a rapid expansion in hiring.\nEven if there were single variables that fully captured labor market conditions and\ninflationary pressures, the future path of those variables would depend on a wide range of\nfactors. Most importantly, and consistent with the definition of a threshold discussed\nearlier, an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent when growth is expected to be below 2\npercent is very different from the same rate when growth is expected to be 4 percent or\nhigher. In the first case, one might expect labor market conditions to deteriorate in future\nquarters. In the second, one would normally expect to see further significant\nimprovement in labor market conditions.\nFurthermore, because we are far from our normal policies, we must acknowledge\nthe uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of these policies, as well as our ability to execute\na graceful exit from unconventional policy (that is, to return to conventional federal funds\nrate policy, and to reduce our large balance sheet to a size more consistent with a\nnormally-functioning economy). Given the lack of historical experience in exiting such a\nlarge balance sheet, the possibility of unintended consequences should not be dismissed.\nWe are very attuned to these concerns and are working to address them.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nDespite the challenge to communicating in simple terms the likely exit strategy, I\nwill say that my own preference would be to continue asset purchases until we had at\nleast reached an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent, given the low rates of inflation we\nhave been experiencing and are likely to be experiencing over the medium term –\nhowever, I will say again that this is a threshold, not a trigger. Assuming that inflation\nand inflation expectations remain well-behaved, at that point the discussion should center\non whether overall labor market conditions are consistent with “substantial\nimprovement” – for example, whether the lower unemployment rate reflects job creation\nrather than reductions in the labor force as discouraged workers stop seeking jobs;\nwhether we are seeing sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we\nenvision continued substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come.\nUnder those conditions, I would stop asset purchases.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, let me reiterate that household spending patterns are\nconsistent with some improvement in the economy, and appear to be responding (as\ndesired) to monetary policy accommodation. Nonetheless, abrupt fiscal austerity or\nadverse shocks from abroad could still overwhelm the nascent positives. Hurricane\nSandy’s effects could exact a toll on the fourth-quarter performance of the economy. In\ngeneral, potential downside risks make an open-ended monetary policy particularly\nattractive, because policy can recalibrate in response to such shocks without starting up\nnew programs.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCertainly I hope that these risks will subside, and we will quickly see more\nimprovement in the economy – leading to a substantial improvement in labor markets and\nan early end to our asset purchase program.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you at Babson, and I would be\nhappy to field a few questions from the students and faculty here today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the overview by Chairman Ben Bernanke in the Question 1 section of “Five Questions about the\nFederal Reserve and Monetary Policy” – remarks at the Economic Club of Indiana available on the Board\nof Governors web site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121001a.htm\n\n2\n\nAlso see remarks by Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy C.

Moreover, the sustainable rate of unemployment typically evolves over time as its fundamental\ndeterminants change.” See “Monetary Policy Objectives and Tools in a Low-Inflation Environment” –\nremarks at the Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment Conference, Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, October 15, 2010,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20101015a.htm\n\n7\n\nThe announcement is available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\n8\n\n“Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis”, available at the following link on the Board of Governors\nwebsite: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm\n9\n\nSee “Acting to Avoid a “Great Stagnation” available at\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/092012/index.htm - and in particular Figure 9.\n\n13\n\n\f",

Much progress has been made, though there certainly remains much to\nbe done for homeowners and businesses in affected areas.\nThis conference is focused on the spread between longer-term interest rates\nprevailing in the marketplace and the rates consumers pay on mortgages. This is an\nimportant topic, given that one of the more important monetary policy initiatives since\nshort-term interest rates reached the zero lower bound has been the purchase of longerterm assets, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These policies seem to be\nhaving the desired effect as the Federal Reserve’s two announcements of asset-purchase\nprograms focused on MBS immediately generated significant declines in the yields on\nsuch securities (on MBS).\nOf course I want to begin as I do all my talks with the reminder that the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nJust how these asset purchase programs actually influence the rates paid by\nhomeowners is complicated by a variety of institutional factors. These include the\nmarket structure of mortgage lenders, the cyclical nature of refinance activity, changes in\nthe credit profile of borrowers, changes in the role of government-sponsored enterprises\n(GSEs) in the mortgage market, and expectations of future interest rate changes that\nimpact the likelihood of refinancing activity. The pass-through of Federal Reserve assetpurchase programs can be influenced by changes in any of these factors, and at times\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nchanges in these factors can provide headwinds or tailwinds impacting the efficacy of the\npolicies.\nAs a result, this is a particularly fruitful time for research in this area, with an eye\nto policy – as research presented today suggests.1 And I hope the development of further\nresearch agendas around these issues will be one result of this conference.\nStill, while we have much to learn about mortgage market developments, and how\nlarge-scale central bank asset purchases pass through to mortgage lending, I want to state\nvery plainly that I believe the monetary policies designed to lower mortgage rates and\nstimulate more activity in interest-sensitive sectors have been effective, and are an\nimportant reason why the U.S. economy has performed better than many of our\ndeveloped-country peers. Work being done at both the Boston and New York Reserve\nbanks has shown that the pass-through of these Fed actions to consumers, appropriately\nmeasured, has been quite large. This type of empirical work is important as both an\nacademic inquiry and a policy-relevant finding.\nConsider that many businesses have reported putting their plans on hold given\nuncertainties around fiscal policy here and in Europe, yet household spending has\ncontinued and housing-related activity has picked up – despite the uncertain environment.\nGiven the tepid economic recovery, high unemployment, and subdued inflation –\nand the uncertainty around fiscal policy – I believe an accommodative monetary policy is\nquite appropriate. We want to see continued improvement in labor markets in the near\nterm, and monetary policy should encourage faster economic growth to achieve that\nobjective.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nSo in my view, a strong case can be made for the Federal Reserve continuing to\npurchase the current $85 billion in longer-term securities a month – even after our socalled “Operation Twist” maturity-extension program2 (a portion of those purchases) is\ncompleted at the end of 2012. This is a topic we will be discussing at the next FOMC\nmeeting.3\n\nChanges in the Composition of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nAs a result of reaching the zero lower bound for short-term interest rates during\nthe financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has engaged in more forward guidance for\nmonetary policy, as well as undertaking large-scale asset purchases. Both are designed to\nflatten the yield curve, with the intention of encouraging additional longer-term\nborrowing – and indeed auto loan rates and mortgage rates are well below their averages\nthrough the business cycle. Today I will discuss the large-scale asset-purchase program.\nMany have focused on the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but it is\nequally important to consider the changes in the composition of the balance sheet.\nParticularly notable is the movement to longer-duration Treasury securities and to\nmortgage-backed securities. Keep in mind, however, that this change in the composition\nof assets has not increased the credit risk taken by the Federal Reserve, as open market\noperations are limited to assets with government guarantees.\nFigure 1 shows the assets held by the Federal Reserve in December 2007 and\nthen at the end of November 2012. The balance sheet changed from under $1 trillion at\nthe end of 2007 to close to $3 trillion in 2012. Equally striking has been the change in\nthe composition of Federal Reserve assets. At the end of 2007, nearly two-thirds of the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nassets were shorter-term (maturing in 5 years or less) Treasury securities and almost onehalf of the securities had a maturity of less than one year. By 2012, the composition had\nchanged. As a result of Operation Twist, the balance sheet has become more heavily\nweighted toward long-duration Treasury securities. In addition, the balance sheet now\nalso includes approximately $880 billion in mortgage-backed securities maturing in more\nthan 10 years.\nFigure 2 provides the same information, but shows how the asset mix has\nchanged over time. The initial expansion of the balance sheet was the result of our\ncrisis-related emergency lending programs. As those emergency programs were wound\ndown, asset purchases resulted in a significant expansion of long-duration Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities. More recently, Operation Twist has resulted in our selling\nthe shorter-term Treasury securities so that most of the securities on the balance sheet are\nmortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities with more than five years to maturity.\n\nConsidering a Reserves-Focused Monetary Policy\nSome observers have advocated for maintaining a short-duration Treasury\nportfolio – arguing that monetary policy would be sufficiently expansionary by adding\nbank reserves, and thus there was no need to extend the duration of assets. In this view,\nsince policy primarily works through bank reserves, purchasing assets that minimized\nrisks – including interest-rate risk – to the Federal Reserve would be preferred. Shortterm Treasury securities have no credit risk and also would carry minimal interest rate\nrisk. Furthermore, in this view another benefit is that the balance sheet could quickly\nshrink by not replacing the short-term securities as they mature.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nBut in my view a reserves-focused monetary policy poses several problems. First,\nthere is little impact on market interest rates, since exchanging Treasury bills that carry a\nlow interest rate for bank reserves that carry a low interest rate will have little in the way\nof interest rate effects. Furthermore, the banking sector would be forced to hold more\nlow-interest reserves at a time when capital is scarce and many banks are seeking to\nshrink rather than expand their own balance sheet. Thus, when interest rates are already\nat the zero lower bound, a short-maturity reserves-focused policy will not have much\nimpact on inflation or employment.\nIn fact, Figure 3 shows that a rapid increase in excess reserves in both the United\nStates and Japan appears to have had little effect on inflation in both countries. While\ninflation in the United States has been close to 2 percent, Japan has continued to have a\nproblem with deflation, despite significant increases in excess reserves.\nFurthermore, the increase in bank reserves has not caused a large increase in bank\nlending, as shown in Figure 4. In Japan, real bank loans are still below where they were\ntwo decades ago. In the United States, despite some growth recently, real bank lending\nremains below levels attained prior to the recession. It is noteworthy that in Japan, policy\nhas generally leaned toward a significant amount of shorter-duration securities – although\nmore recently there have been greater purchases of longer-duration assets.\n\nSpread-Focused Monetary Policy\nIn contrast to reserves-focused monetary policy, spread-focused monetary policy\nseeks to lower the cost of funds to households and firms by purchasing longer-duration\nassets. This policy, like the purchase of short-term Treasury securities, increases\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreserves. However, the transmission mechanism is not primarily through excess reserves,\nbut rather focuses on altering the cost of longer-term borrowing.\nCentral bank purchases of long-term Treasury securities flatten the yield curve\nand cause other medium- and long-term rates, including those on autos and houses, to\ndecline. Similarly, the purchase of mortgage-backed securities causes rates to decline for\nMBS but also for other longer-duration assets. By reducing the borrowing cost of these\npurchases, demand for cars and houses should be stimulated. By altering interest rates\nfaced by firms and households, as well as expanding the amount of reserves, the\ntransmission of monetary policy is likely to be much more effective given that the\neconomy has already reached the lower bound for short-term interest rates.\nAdmittedly, spread-focused monetary policy carries some risk for a country’s\nmonetary authority. Because the duration of assets is much longer, the balance sheet will\nnot automatically shrink as rapidly when purchases are discontinued. Furthermore, if the\nplan is fully effective and quickly restores the economy to more normal financial\nconditions – including higher market interest rates – then the market value of the central\nbank’s portfolio of low-yielding securities will inevitably decrease.\n\nPotential Advantages of Large-Scale MBS Purchases\nBoth long-term Treasury securities and mortgage rates have continued to fall as\nthe Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term securities,4 as Figure 5 highlights.\nA common way of describing the mechanism through which the central bank’s\npurchase of longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities affects\ninterest rates is that such purchases “remove duration” from the marketplace – driving up\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprices for assets with longer duration and thus pushing down yields, and resulting in a\nreduction in longer-term rates generally. This view takes MBS and Treasuries to be\nfairly close substitutes, and assumes that duration is the most important attribute that\ninvestors seek in choosing among investment alternatives. Since the mortgage-backed\nsecurities purchased have government guarantees, both Treasury securities and mortgagebacked securities do not have default risk.\nDespite these similarities, however, there may be several reasons for a central\nbank to prefer large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Some of these\nreasons involve loosening the assumption that assets are close substitutes and that\nduration is the key channel through which central bank purchases have effects.\nFirst, mortgage rates may be more responsive to a purchase of MBS than\npurchases of similar amounts of Treasury securities if mortgages are less-than-perfect\nsubstitutes for Treasuries, in part because investors have quite specific preferences for\nmortgage securities – what financial economists call “market segmentation.” Under\nmarket segmentation – which is consistent with the fact that the spread between Treasury\nand MBS securities varies over time rather than remaining constant – purchases of MBS\nmay have a larger impact on mortgage rates than purchases of Treasury securities.\nParticularly at a time when housing prices are beginning to rise in many markets, making\nmortgage rates attractive may encourage potential home buyers to not delay their\npurchase decision.\nSecond, the ability to refinance mortgages with no prepayment penalty makes the\nsecurities quite different from Treasury securities in several respects – perhaps one of the\nkey reasons that investors see them as imperfect substitutes. From the perspective of a\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncentral bank purchasing the securities, many mortgages will be repaid early (before\nmaturity) even if interest rates rise. Individuals move for a variety of reasons including\nchanges in employment, a need to purchase a larger home, or a desire to downsize once\nchildren leave the home. As a result, while many people may take on a 30-year\nmortgage, most people will retire the mortgage well before its 30-year maturity.\nTo that end, Figure 6 provides the percent of homeowners that have been in their\nhomes for at least 10 or 20 years, in 2000 and in 2010. Over both horizons, roughly half\nthe homeowners had been in their homes for at least 10 years, and roughly one-quarter\nhad been in their homes for at least 20 years. Thus, even if rates were to rise, a\nsignificant percentage of mortgages would likely retire, providing a much shorter\nduration than for longer-term Treasury securities of a similar maturity.5, 6\nHowever, the downside of being able to retire the mortgage without prepayment\npenalty is that the pass-through of lower mortgage costs from the investor to the\nhomeowner can be less than one-for-one. Changes in the propensity to retire mortgages\nwill influence the price of mortgages, and the extent to which a lower wholesale\nmortgage rate will be passed through to borrowers. This may be particularly true for\nhigh-rate mortgages that reflect the desire to avoid paying points or closing costs, or that\nreflect the credit worthiness of the borrower – since both may reflect a higher propensity\nto retire the mortgage should circumstances change.\nThird, Treasury markets are highly liquid, so that the liquidity premium is still\nrelatively small for seasoned issues. As a result, Treasury securities are often preferred\nduring times of crises because investors can easily exit their positions should they need to\nraise funds. The mortgage-backed securities market is less liquid, particularly for\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nseasoned issues. Thus during times of stress, the functioning of the mortgage market\nmay be impaired, providing an opportunity for a central bank purchase program to\nimprove market functioning as well as change the relative price of securities by\nintroducing a new large-scale buyer. The crisis events of 2008 provide an example.\nFinally, there may be capacity constraints in only buying MBS securities or only\nbuying Treasury securities. Because of potential capacity constraints and the fact that the\ndegree of substitutability may be situational, a strong case can be made for purchasing\nboth MBS and Treasury securities – with the proportions depending on the\ncircumstances.\nThus if the purpose is to improve market functioning, or to provide focused\nstimulus to an interest-sensitive sector in order to stimulate aggregate demand, it may be\nthat MBS purchases are preferable to Treasury security purchases.7\nAlso, even though the impact on mortgage markets may be particularly favorable\nat certain times, MBS purchases are likely to have an impact beyond the mortgage\nmarket. Figure 7 shows that mortgage rates have fallen during large asset purchase\nprograms, but Figure 8 shows that corporate rates also have declined, and Figure 9\nshows that prices on assets such as stocks have generally risen during this time period,\ndespite significant economic uncertainty.\nHence, given the effectiveness of this policy and the relatively high\nunemployment rate and inflation8 that is running below our 2 percent target, I fully\nsupport the policy decisions to provide stimulus through asset purchases – and I believe\nthat including MBS purchases in the first and third asset-purchase programs have\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncontributed to a stronger economic outcome than we would have seen in the absence of\nthese approaches.\nWhile asset prices do seem to have been affected by the purchase programs, the\nultimate goal is to stimulate further economic growth. Thus it is heartening that despite\nthe economic uncertainties, households seem more confident in the economic future and\nare again purchasing long-term assets such as houses. As Figure 10 shows, housing\nstarts have been increasing, as have housing prices in many markets. Accommodative\nmonetary policy has provided an important support to an economy still suffering from the\nimpact of the financial crisis and the continued fiscal uncertainty here and abroad.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that many factors influence the passthrough of monetary policy to interest rates and output. This conference is highlighting\nmany of the challenges to obtaining a full pass through to the mortgage rates faced by\nhouseholds. Nonetheless, long-term rates – including mortgage rates – do appear to have\nreacted to actions undertaken by the Fed.\nI hope that as a result of the work of those at this conference, we can achieve an\neven better appreciation for additional steps that could be taken so that more households\ncan benefit from stimulative monetary policy designed to encourage faster economic\ngrowth.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M.

In the absence of those\npurchases, the amount of long-duration securities that the Fed would be buying each month would decline\nto $40 billion.\n\n4\n\nOf course, some of this decline is because the economy continued to disappoint.\n\n5\n\nIn addition, the mortgages backing an MBS amortize, shortening the duration of MBS’s relative to same\nmaturity Treasuries. So MBS’s should be expected to roll off the Fed's balance sheet faster than Treasuries,\nboth due to amortization and due to prepayments. Still, prepayments from refinancing activity would\ndecline in a rising interest rate environment, thus increasing the MBS's duration other things equal. Such\nan effect partially offsets the benefits of holding MBS’s deriving from amortization and from prepayments\nnot related to refinancing activity.\n6\n\nHomeowners with low interest rates can rent out their homes if they are forced to move by a job change or\nother life event. Obviously, only a small fraction of owners are likely to do this, because of the challenges\nof managing a property after a move to a new area. But there are companies that will manage properties for\nabsentee owners, and rising interest rates may dissuade some owners from moving in the first place.\n7\n\nA counterargument some may make is that Treasury purchases may have broader impacts on many\nsomewhat similar securities — including mortgages.\n8\n\nPersonal Consumption Expenditure or PCE.\n\n12\n\n\f",
