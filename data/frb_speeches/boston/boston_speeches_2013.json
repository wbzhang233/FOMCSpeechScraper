Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGreater Providence Chamber of\nCommerce Policy Forum\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nJanuary 15, 2013\n\nI appreciate having been invited to speak again to the Providence Chamber of Commerce.\nAs all of you know, Rhode Island was one of the states most severely impacted by the recession,\nand it remains one of the hardest-hit states even at this point in the economic recovery. Rhode\nIsland is one of only two states that as of November continued to have a state unemployment rate\nin excess of 10 percent.\nPersistently high unemployment rates have enormous personal and societal costs. So in\nmy view it is critical that public policy continues to actively support the economy’s return to full\nemployment.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nToday I would like to highlight that the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy\nhas played an important role in the recovery we have seen to date. And I would like to explain\nwhy I consider it imperative that monetary policy continue to actively support the economy at\npresent – since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same\ntime, inflation is undershooting the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target.1\nAs always, I would note that my remarks encompass my own views, not necessarily those\nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\n\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy has grown at an average 2.2 percent annual rate since the recovery\nofficially began in June of 2009. Data suggest that growth was likely a bit below that rate for the\nmost recent quarter, and the employment report for December showed that the national economy\ncontinues to only gradually improve. Given that many businesses and households were deferring\ndecisions until there was more clarity on the fiscal outlook, the emerging picture of the fourth\nquarter (stemming from sources such as the employment report) is encouraging. The national\nfiscal uncertainty cast a shadow on the economy, but it seems there have been some signs of\nunderlying strength.\nI consider it particularly encouraging that some interest-sensitive sectors, which are likely\nto be especially responsive to monetary stimulus, are clearly showing themselves to be “on the\nmend.” Both the housing sector and purchases of consumer durables have been recovering, in\npart as a response to the accommodative monetary policy the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nUnfortunately, recent economic improvements have been partially offset by the deferral\nof spending decisions by households and firms. In all likelihood, these deferrals result in part\nfrom uncertainty over national fiscal policy, as well as from the impact of fiscal austerity that has\nalready taken place – particularly at the state and local government levels. If some of the\n“headwinds” from fiscal austerity discussions here and in Europe abate, we should begin to see\ngrowth come in at a pace that is above the economy’s long-run potential growth rate. Such\ngrowth would bring about both economic expansion and improvements in labor markets.\n\nInterest sensitive sectors are responding to monetary policy\nThe sectors of the economy that are showing the most improvement recently are those\nthat economists generally consider to be the most responsive to monetary policy and interest\nrates. Particularly notable is the improvement in the outlook for the housing market. Figure 1\nshows growth in real residential investment compared to growth in real GDP. Over the past year\nreal GDP growth has averaged 2.6 percent. In contrast, growth in residential investment\noccurred at much higher rates, and I expect this positive momentum to continue through 2013.\nFigure 2 provides the rationale for my optimism about residential investment. Housing\nprices in many parts of the country have begun to rise, and although it is not broken out on the\nchart, this includes prices in some of the areas that were hardest hit by declines in housing prices.\nIn addition, mortgage rates remain near their cyclical lows and well below the average mortgage\nrate experienced over the past 25 years. With prices edging up and interest rates at historic\nlows, there is now something of an incentive for a potential home buyer to actively pursue\nbuying a home. This is the case because both mortgage rates and house prices could be higher if\npotential buyers delay their purchase decisions.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThis current dynamic substantially improves the outlook for housing in my view, together\nwith the fact that houses have become more affordable. The ratio of house prices to rents – a\nsummary measure of the cost of owning versus renting – has fallen back to traditional levels after\nrising to significant heights during the housing bubble. Finally, in the wake of the financial crisis\nand recession, many people postponed creating new households as they sought to improve their\nfinancial position. But there has been an improvement in household formation recently and\nmany of these new households will be potential home buyers.\nFigure 3 shows that consumer-durable purchases have also increased, in part as a result\nof the very low interest rate environment. Consumer-durable purchases have been a source of\nstrength over the past year, and have grown much more quickly than real GDP. I expect\nconsumer-durable purchases to continue to be a source of strength over 2013.\nOne particular area of rapid growth has been new car purchases (Figure 4). Recent\npurchases may have something to do with the fact that the average age of cars on the road is now\n11.1 years.2 Some potential car buyers surely postponed decisions until the economic outlook\nwas clearer. So we are seeing a need to replace some aging cars, along with particularly\nattractive terms available because of the low interest rate environment. The result was purchases\nof cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of well over 15 million in November\nand December. However, a potential concern is that the payroll tax increases that were part of\nthe recent tax agreement will impact the real disposable income of potential buyers. Partially\noffsetting this had been the lower average gas prices in the fourth quarter, although they have\nrisen somewhat, recently.\nSo overall, I see monetary policy having an impact, in encouraging the purchase of\ninterest-sensitive assets like homes, cars, and consumer durables. The most interest-sensitive\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsectors have been responding to the monetary stimulus from the Fed, and this stimulus has\nprovided a major source of strength for the economy last year. And it is likely to be a source of\nsupport in 2013.\nUnfortunately, the strength in interest-sensitive sectors is partially offset by weakness in\nother areas of the economy. In particular, while the country certainly needs to get to a\nsustainable long-term fiscal path, the direct and indirect impacts of recent fiscal austerity\ndeliberations have in my view been one reason that the economy has not snapped back more\nquickly.\n\nFiscal policy, policy uncertainty, and Europe remain potential constraints\nIndeed, a major source of economic weakness during the recovery has been the need for\nstate and local governments to cut budgets.3 Whatever your views on the political economy of\ngovernment spending, in the short term fiscal austerity removes spending from the economy. In\nmany cases this drop in public spending increases unemployment as teachers, police, and other\nworkers are laid off.\nIn part due to the weakness in housing that strained state and local government finances,\nstate and local government spending has been a large drag on the economy. This spending\naccounts for close to 12 percent of the goods and services purchased in the economy.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, while state and local government spending remained a drag in\nlate 2011 and the first half of last year, there was actually a slight increase in real state and local\ngovernment spending in the third quarter of last year. Many expect that state and local spending\nwill increase modestly this year, too. Federal spending has been more volatile, but generally has\nbeen a source of weakness as a component of economic activity as well.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSince federal spending accounts for roughly 8 percent of the goods and services\npurchased in the economy, this is a major source of uncertainty for 2013. Given the large fiscal\ndeficits still being run, the process by which the nation can reach a more sustainable long-term\nfiscal policy remains rather uncertain. What does seem certain is that there will be cuts in\ngovernment spending which, like higher taxes, will by the simple math of the GDP calculation\nslow down overall economic growth.\nThere is substantial uncertainty over the fate of federal government grants to state and\nlocal governments.4 Substantial cutbacks in these grants would have a ripple effect on the\neconomy. Similarly, there is the issue of potential federal tax base broadening in order to reduce\nthe federal budget deficit. This will have implications for business and family budgets.\nWhile the need for long-run sustainable fiscal policy is both clear and uncontroversial, I\nbelieve it is important to achieve sustainability in a way that does not risk the tentative economic\nimprovements we have experienced to date.\nOne area that has probably been impacted by the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy\nhas been business investment, shown in Figure 6. Nationally, business investment had been a\nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, but capital spending by firms weakened\nsignificantly in the third quarter of last year – as many firms sought more clarity on government\ntax and spending decisions before committing to long-term investments. Fiscal uncertainty\ntherefore accounts for at least some share of the recent weakness in business spending, and\nunfortunately this potential cause for weakness in business spending is likely to persist this year.\nA third source of weakness remains the weak outlook for many of our trading partners, as\nshown in Figure 7. Both Japan and Europe have grown more slowly than the United States.\nAdditionally, Japan still struggles with a serious deflation problem, and Europe continues to\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\naddress fiscal imbalances in many of its peripheral countries. Both regions are also experiencing\naging populations, demographically speaking, which brings some difficult fiscal and economic\nchallenges.\nDespite these headwinds at home and abroad, I do expect improvement in U.S. economic\ngrowth this year. While in the first half of 2013 I think the economy is likely to grow at roughly\nits potential level of growth, I expect growth in the second half of the year to be closer to 3\npercent – assuming that headwinds from fiscal imbalances around the world are not resolved in\neconomically disruptive ways.\n\nBoth inflation and unemployment remain far from long-run FOMC estimates\nFigure 8 shows the U.S. inflation experience since 2003. While many critics of\nmonetary policy have been concerned with inflationary pressures, through most of the recovery\ncore PCE inflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Notably, despite\nthe rapid growth of the central bank’s balance sheet in 2008, as well as the balance sheet’s\ncontinued growth more recently, there has been no upward trend in inflation. Total PCE\ninflation is only 1.4 percent over the past year and core PCE inflation is at 1.5 percent.\nSo current inflation is well below the Fed’s target, and expected inflation5 is well below\nlevels that the FOMC has stated would generate a discussion of lifting short-term rates.6 Being\nmore than half a percent below our target for PCE inflation highlights why I believe aggressive\nmonetary policy remains appropriate, given that the 7.8 percent unemployment rate is well above\nwhere the FOMC expects the unemployment rate to settle in the longer run.\nThe national unemployment rate has fallen during the recovery, as shown in Figure 9,\nand in fact payroll employment growth has averaged 151,000 jobs over the past three months.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nNonetheless, the societal costs to elevated unemployment rates that are falling only slowly show\nwhy accommodative monetary policy is both appropriate and needed.\nFigure 10 shows employment in the construction and consumer durable sectors as a\nshare of the U.S. labor force. By our calculation, if construction employment returned to its\n2004 levels and durable goods manufacturing regained half of the jobs lost since 2004, the\nunemployment rate would be 6.5 percent (meaning an additional 2.1 million people would be\nemployed).7\nWhile interest-sensitive sectors are one of the areas of growth, a more rapid return to the\nmore normal employment shares for those sectors would significantly improve job prospects for\nworkers that have been unemployed or underemployed. Construction and durable goods are both\nindustries that have provided employment opportunities for some with less educational\nattainment, an area of particularly elevated unemployment rates (as shown in Figure 11). A\nfaster recovery in construction and durable goods would help re-employ those working in sectors\nof the economy that have suffered greatly during the recession and the painfully slow recovery.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion I would just reiterate my view that continued monetary accommodation is\nabsolutely appropriate and indeed needed as long as we are projected to miss on both elements of\nthe Fed’s dual mandate, inflation and employment. Currently inflation is somewhat below our 2\npercent target, and unemployment is well above a longer-run sustainable rate.\nAs the recent FOMC statement highlighted, monetary policy should be guided by current\nand future economic outcomes, not calendar dates. Interest-sensitive sectors have been\nresponding to accommodative policy, and we should all continue to encourage a quicker\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nrecovery in those sectors. If we were able to see construction and durable-goods production\nreturn to a more normalized share of the workforce, it would have a meaningful impact on\npotential employees in those interest-sensitive sectors and also on the broader national labor\nmarkets.\nAgain I thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. And particularly in light of\nthe challenges Rhode Island has encountered in recent years, I wish you all an improved year in\n2013.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAs measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE.\n\n2\n\nAs of July 2011.\n\n3\n\nA new report from the Rockefeller Institute presents information on \"unprecedented\" cuts in state-local\ngovernment employment [http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/government_finance/2013-01-09-StateLocal_Government_Employment.pdf]. The report notes that reductions in state and local government employment\nbetween August 2008 and November 2012 in Rhode Island were second largest of all the states in percentage terms\n(see Table 4 of the report). Connecticut and Vermont were also in the top 10 in this regard.\n\n4\n\nThe Pew Center on the States calculates that the federal grants subject to sequestration amount to about 6.5 percent\nof state government revenues nationwide.\n5\n\nThe statement refers to a situation where “…inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more\nthan a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations continue to be well anchored.”\n\n6\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm\n\n7\n\nThis considers that there is a secular decline in durable-goods manufacturing. If durable goods employment\nreturned to its 2004 levels as well, the unemployment rate would fall further, to 6.0 percent.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nComments on the Paper\n“Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role\nof Monetary Policy”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 22, 2013\n\nThe paper “Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role of Monetary Policy” by\nGreenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin provides both a theoretical and empirical look\nat the fiscal challenges facing many advanced economies. The first part of the paper\nfocuses on the sustainability of current trends, given the number of countries with high\nlevels of fiscal debt to GDP and serious trade imbalances.\nThe paper makes some observations with which I concur:\n1. That unsustainable fiscal policies need to be made sustainable.\n2. That the “tipping point” for fiscal policies in many developed countries should\nbe an area of concern and continued attention.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n3. That the tipping point can be difficult to precisely determine for individual\ncountries, but the range of debt-to-GDP levels in many advanced economies\nshould make policymakers attentive to imbalances.\nI would like to split my discussion of the paper into two parts. First, I will discuss\nthe authors’ empirical work on tipping points. In that discussion I will emphasize that the\nempirical work is a good first step in analyzing the potential of reaching a tipping point,\nbut that the empirical work would probably benefit from a more extensive examination of\nother factors that influence tipping points.\nIn the second part of my comments today I will discuss the costs and benefits of\nthe large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program as an instrument of monetary policy.\nWhile remittances – which the authors focus on – are one potential factor worth\nconsidering when estimating the costs of this program, I will suggest that a fuller set of\nbenefits and costs of the program for the economy are needed.\nAs always, I would note that the views I express here today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\nEmpirical work on tipping points\nThe paper provides an empirical model of long-term government bond rates. The\nbasic model estimates the government bond rate as a function of debt to GDP (both net\nand gross), the current account deficit, and time and country dummy variables. This\nmodel is in the spirit of much literature that looks at the probability of a sovereign default\nor tries to empirically estimate sovereign debt default premiums. While much of the\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nearlier literature was focused on problems with sovereign default for less developed\ncountries, this study focuses on the potential for sovereign default premiums to rise in a\nset of advanced economies.\nFrom this rather parsimonious model the authors draw a number of conclusions.\nIn particular, that at the level of current account deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios currently\nexperienced in many advanced economies, the risk of rising sovereign default premiums\nis quite high. Furthermore, if unaddressed, these premiums could reach a tipping point\nthat becomes unsustainable.\nWhile this degree of parsimoniousness in a model can be a virtue, I would suggest\nthat if there are important omitted variables from the empirical work then the coefficient\nestimates can be biased, and the effects attributed to the variables in the model can be a\nproxy for effects that are really driven by movements in the omitted variables. Because\nthe model includes both dummy variables for countries and time, the omitted variables\nwould need to be variables that could drive long-term rates that vary over time and by\ncountry. How likely is that to be the case with this simple regression?\nConsider the example of Ireland. Figure 1 shows that in 2006 Ireland had a very\nlow debt-to-GDP ratio. In fact, debt to GDP was substantially lower than that of the\nU.S., U.K., and France. The current account deficit was better than that of the United\nStates, similar to that of the U.K., and somewhat worse than that of France. Despite this\nrelatively sanguine situation in 2006, Ireland was close to the tipping point. Debt to GDP\nwas about to rise quickly, as seen in Figure 2, and Ireland was about to lose the ability to\nissue long-term debt.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe problem in Ireland was that while fiscal debt was well controlled, the country\nwas facing a serious financial stability problem. So, what type of financial stability\nvariables might capture the impending tipping point in a way that is not captured by the\nsimple empirical model?\nOne example of a potentially important omitted variable is the financial strength\nof the banking sector. For example, non-performing assets of the banking sector relative\nto GDP would capture the impact of building banking pressures. In Ireland, banking\nproblems rather than fiscal problems were an important driver in hitting the tipping point.\nAnother variable that varies over time and by country would be the percentage change in\nreal estate prices or possibly the difference between the return on owning and the return\non renting. These types of variables would try to capture the growing risk of bubbles in\nIreland and Spain.\nA second set of potential omitted variables relates to the political determinants of\nrisk premiums. One frequently sees that credit default rates spike around elections, and\nthat countries that are politically destabilized have difficulty generating the political will\nto address problems – particularly if public opinion is as fragmented as the political\nprocess. This might be captured by how frequently national elections were held over the\npast four years, or by other political variables capturing the difficulty in obtaining a stable\nmajority political party in some countries at some times.\nAnother political variable that might be relevant is a variable that captures\nwhether there is stable fiscal federalism in a country. For example in Spain, debt and\nbanking problems have been exacerbated by the reality of regions that were autonomous\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbut not necessarily fiscally responsible. A variable that might capture this impact is state\nand local government debt to GDP.\nA third set of potential omitted variables would reflect labor market conditions.\nWith a currency union, persistent differences in competitiveness can push countries to the\ntipping point. Measures of labor market productivity might capture this impact, which\nmay vary over countries and over time. Another potential important variable would be\ndifferences in unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP. Countries with growing\nunfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP may need to eventually raise government\ndebt to fund these liabilities, pushing a country to the tipping point.\nA variety of other potential omitted variables could be explored. Credit default\nswap rates tend to move as countries approach high rollover periods. A debt\nmanagement variable might capture this rollover risk by looking at short-term debt\nrelative to GDP. And demographic variables may also be relevant. Countries with fastgrowing, well-educated populations may be less at risk of tipping points than countries\nwith declining populations that are not well educated.\nWhile this is not an exhaustive list of omitted variables, it does highlight that such\na pared-down model may ignore important drivers of tipping points. In addition, one\ncannot be sure that the coefficients used in simulations might not change significantly\nwith a more richly specified model.\nWhile this paper provides a good discussion of tipping points, the coefficients and\nsimulations should be viewed as indicative of a more general point – that policymakers\nshould consider how a variety of public policies, including fiscal policies, can influence\ntipping points.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nBenefits and Costs of LSAPS\nThe final section of the paper discusses the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet. It highlights a potential problem – that if monetary policy is successful in\nreturning us quickly to full employment, or if interest rates rise for other reasons such as\nreaching a tipping point, remittances to the Treasury would be impacted. The baseline\nscenario the authors provide reflects gains overall for the LSAP, but under the authors’\nmost pessimistic scenarios significant losses are generated.\nUnfortunately, this discussion does not do justice to the policy trade-offs, in my\nopinion. To take them into account, ideally one would do a more complete comparison\nof how the economy and fiscal policy would evolve with and without large-scale asset\npurchase (LSAP) programs in place.\nThe purpose of the LSAP is to reduce long-term interest rates to stimulate the\neconomy. Analysis of the LSAP program requires looking at more than remittances.\nIdeally one would start with how well policy – with and without LSAPs – fulfills the\nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate, provided by Congress. Even if one wanted to focus on\nthe more narrow fiscal impact, I believe one would need a much fuller analysis.\nAnd to capture the benefits of the LSAP you need a fuller model. One of the\nmodels currently used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston provides a relatively\nconservative estimate of the economic benefits of a hypothetical additional $750 billion\nLSAP. Based on historical experience, the model implies that such a purchase would\nlower long-term rates by 20 to 25 basis points, relative to not making the additional\npurchases. The impact of this large a reduction in long-term rates is a cumulative gain in\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreal GDP, relative to the base, of 1.6 percent or $260 billion. In our model such a\npurchase also results in a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.25 percent or 400,000\njobs. Some of the models we run provide a larger impact to such purchases.\nNonetheless, such estimation provides a baseline for considering the economic\nbenefits of additional purchases. These estimates are subject to a considerable degree of\nuncertainty, and the impact could easily be higher or lower than that implied by our\nmodel. However, based on our statistical work using historical data, we believe these are\nreasonable estimates of the benefits.\nEven if one wanted to focus on the fiscal impact of the LSAP program, I would\nsuggest that the impact goes beyond remittances provided to the Treasury. The first\neffect would be to examine the path of interest rates on government debt with and\nwithout the LSAP program. Since the LSAP reduces interest rates, such a simulation\nwould show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced by the lowered cost of financing fiscal\ndeficits as a result of the LSAP program.\nThe second fiscal impact would be from faster economic growth. Faster\neconomic growth produces more tax revenue and, by reducing unemployment, reduces\ngovernment entitlement expenditures on programs such as unemployment insurance.\nThus, LSAPs actually produce a much more positive fiscal impact than the authors\nsuggest.\nMoreover, the evaluation of the program needs to include the contributions of\nLSAPs to achieving the goals of the dual mandate for U.S. monetary policy. We\ncurrently have an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent in the country and PCE inflation of\n1.3 percent. Had we not undertaken LSAP policies, we would be even further away from\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nachieving each element of our dual mandate, with an unemployment rate higher and an\ninflation rate lower than we currently have (assuming we have been successful in\nimproving the economy).\nAs Figure 3 shows, loan rates on mortgages and autos have declined since the\nzero lower bound for the federal funds rate was hit, and home and auto sales have been\nimproving. These interest-sensitive sectors have been among the fastest growing\ncomponents of real GDP over the past year. Some of this improvement is the result of\nour LSAP policies.\nFinally, extended periods of unemployment may have long-run costs that have\nboth fiscal and broader economic impacts. If an extended period of high unemployment\ncauses more workers to drop out of the labor force and places many new workers on a\npermanently lower income growth path – as many studies have shown – then failing to\nundertake LSAPs can have much broader impacts on fiscal and economic policies.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe authors of this paper have provided a useful contribution to the literature by\nhighlighting the impact of not considering fiscal tipping points. As their work highlights,\nhitting fiscal tipping points can have dire consequences for all citizens – and predicting\nwhen such a tipping point will be hit is difficult. As a result, fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers need to be mindful of the potential of their actions to impact tipping points.\nBut I hope my discussion today has highlighted that, with respect to monetary\npolicy, the LSAP program improves the broader fiscal outlook by lowering interest rates\nand providing more economic growth. In addition, it returns the economy to full\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nemployment and an inflation rate at the 2 percent target more quickly than would have\noccurred in the absence of such actions. We do well to also consider these benefits, and\nthe costs of inaction, when evaluating policy.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBank for International Settlements Forum on Key Regulatory and\nSupervisory Issues in a Basel III World\nKeynote Address\nSeoul, Korea\nFebruary 25, 2013\n\nThe impact of the recent financial crisis has significantly changed the supervision and\nregulation of financial organizations.* Countries such as the U.K., Switzerland, and Sweden\nare not only planning on implementing the tougher Basel III capital standards, but are also\nconsidering whether they should require institutions to hold capital significantly above Basel\nIII capital levels.\n\n*\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nIn the United States, the financial crisis has caused reexamination of how we think\nabout bank regulation, bank supervision, and financial stability. Bank regulation before the\nfinancial crisis had become focused on using risk weighting to determine appropriate\nregulatory levels of bank capital. However, the risk weights on certain assets did not perform\nas expected when mortgages with low risk weights became the epicenter of problems, when\nmany securities that had high ratings and low capital charges fell dramatically in price, and\nwhen the originate-to-distribute (versus originate and hold) model1 of lending was exposed as\nnot distributing risk as widely as assumed.\nAssets with high ratings received little supervisory attention, as risk-focused\nsupervision focused on lower-quality assets. And off-balance-sheet exposures received\ninsufficient supervisory scrutiny. Supervisors gained a false sense of comfort from models\nthat aimed to look far out into the so-called tail of banks’ potential loss distributions. But,\nthese models failed to explicitly consider what would occur during times of severe\nmacroeconomic stress.\nIndeed it seems in hindsight that the very concept of financial stability was poorly\nunderstood before the financial crisis. Too little attention was devoted to the consequences\nof large institution failures, as the impact of such failures had not been fully considered in a\nway that adequately reflected a broader understanding of interconnected relationships. While\nliquidity had been receiving more attention at commercial banks, insufficient attention was\ngiven to the potential for runs on other financial institutions (for example broker-dealers) or\nproducts (such as money market mutual funds). Run risk was also badly underestimated in\nstructured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, which\nbecame difficult to finance during the crisis.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nAs a result of these important crisis lessons, dramatic changes have been made. The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the DFA), in\nconjunction with Basel III capital standards, significantly increased the quantity and quality of\ncapital expected to be held by banks. The introduction of stress tests, mandated by the DFA,\nincreased attention on whether capital will be sufficient during stressful situations. While\nrules have not yet been finalized in the U.S., there will be additional capital charges for\nsystemically important financial institutions. In addition, as required by the DFA, the largest\nbanks have already submitted plans describing how they may be resolved should that be\nnecessary.\nGiven the rapid changes occurring in supervision and regulation, some commenters\nhave argued that the regulatory pendulum has already overcompensated, and that capital\nrequirements are increasing too much and too fast. In particular, given the fragile state of the\nrecovery that has occurred in most advanced economies, some argue that new capital\nrequirements are overly conservative relative to historical experience and their imposition\ncould stall the economic recovery.\nToday, I will briefly examine the evidence for these arguments in the United States. I\nwill first examine whether regulatory capital thresholds are too high, based on evidence from\nthe financial crisis which will be more fully described in a forthcoming Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston working paper. The results of that work will highlight that capital depletion during\nthe financial crisis was extensive, and occurred relatively quickly, for many of the largest\nfinancial institutions in the United States – which is why it is critically important to examine\nwhether large financial institutions are holding sufficient capital.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nI will argue that the improvements in capital ratios that have occurred since the crisis\nare quite striking and have placed the U.S. economy in a better position to finance the\nrecovery going forward. If, however, enhanced capital were the only regulatory response to\nthe crisis, then our analysis would suggest that the size of the “SIFI surcharge” could be\ninsufficient. But in conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, regulators have undertaken several\nother significant reforms – including liquidity standards, stress tests and resolution plans. Our\nresults highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach.\nAnd contrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that\neven under the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge\ndoes not appear excessive. Throughout I will argue that as we better understand systemically\nimportant financial institutions, we may want to better integrate lessons from stress testing\nand resolution procedures into capital requirements for the largest banks.\n\nI. Capital Depletion at Systemically Important Institutions During the Financial Crisis\nA paper that will soon be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston uses\na panel of large, systemically important banks to examine the magnitude of capital erosion\nthat occurred during the financial crisis. The panel includes banks that failed, banks that were\nmerged into other institutions, and banks that survived the crisis intact. The analysis uses a\nvariety of adjustments to make the accounting measures of capital consistent across\ninstitutions – including removing sources of direct government capital support, adjusting for\nstructural changes to the firm, and making accounting adjustments for firms that were not\nbank holding companies throughout the period.2\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nThe paper examines how much Tier 1 common equity ratios deteriorated (the “capital\nerosion”) during each institution’s crisis period – defined as the period during the financial\ncrisis when the institution suffered its largest capital erosion.3\nThe results are shown in Figure 1. Not surprisingly, those institutions with the largest\ncapital erosion tended to be institutions that merged or failed during the crisis. These\ninstitutions tended to have a heavy exposure to residential real estate, like Washington Mutual\nand Countrywide, or tended to have a business model particularly susceptible to runs because\nof dependence on wholesale funding – such as the investment banks Lehman Brothers and\nMerrill Lynch. The loss of capital during this period is striking, and underscores how much\ncapital can be depleted during an unusually severe financial crisis.\nFigure 2 shows the erosion of Tier 1 common equity relative to buffers being used in\nthe Basel III framework. During the stress test exercises associated with the Federal\nReserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review (CCAR) program we have\nrequired that bank capital exceed 5 percent Tier 1 common equity over the forecast horizon,\nbased on the premise that such a buffer would be required for financial firms to fully operate\nand maintain investor and counterparty confidence during stressful periods. Basel III sets the\nminimum Tier 1 common equity plus the conservation buffer at 7 percent. Furthermore,\nunder Basel III, systemically important financial institutions are expected to maintain\nadditional buffers of 1 to 2.5 percentage points. This heightened standard provides capital\nbuffers of 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and 450 basis points above the Tier 1 common\nequity benchmark used during the stress tests.\nFor the 26 large banks examined in the Boston Reserve Bank’s study, half had losses\nbelow the 200 basis point buffer. That is, given the losses experienced during the financial\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\ncrisis, which was quite severe, half of the largest banks – if they held at least 7 percent Tier 1\ncommon equity – would have remained above the 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio during their\nperiod of most severe capital erosion during the crisis. On the other hand, this also highlights\nthat for some banks, such a buffer would not have been sufficient.\nTurning to those financial institutions with the largest capital erosion, eight of the 26\nbanks would have had losses that exceeded 450 basis points. Such losses would have\nexceeded the buffers provided by the currently proposed maximum \"SIFI surcharge\" (for\nsystemically important financial institutions)4 and conservation buffer, and would have caused\ncapital to fall below the 5 percent tier 1 common equity floor that has been used in the CCAR\nstress tests unless banks were holding capital above the regulatory required minimum. This\nhighlights that while the capital buffers should provide significantly greater capital than was\nheld prior to the crisis, the capital buffers do not seem excessive given the losses experienced\nduring the financial crisis at some of our largest institutions.\nWhile such results arguably substantiate the need for relatively large SIFI surcharges,\nhigh capital levels alone are not enough. Our results highlight the need for a multi-pronged\napproach that employs newly-developed supervisory tools – including stress tests, liquidity\nstandards, and resolution plans – in conjunction with capital charges.\n\nII. Improvements in the quality and quantity of capital\nFigure 3 shows how dramatic the improvement in capital ratios has been at large U.S.\nfinancial institutions. For example, the Tier 1 common capital ratio aggregated across 15\nlarge U.S. banking organizations fell to close to 5 percent in late 2008. 5 However, during the\neconomic recovery these institutions have significantly improved their Tier 1 common capital\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nratio, to above 10 percent. The broader definitions of capital show similar strong\nimprovement relative to pre-crisis norms.\nIn addition, Figure 4 highlights that the quality of capital has also significantly\nimproved. Tier 1 common capital accounts for a larger share of total risk-based capital, as\nshown in the top chart. Tangible common equity, a narrow definition of capital shown in the\nbottom chart, has improved significantly since the fourth quarter of 2008. While total capital\nhas improved, the particularly large increase in narrowly defined tangible capital highlights a\nsignificant improvement in loss absorption capacity.\nRelative to the 7 percent minimum for Tier 1 common equity plus the capital\nconservation buffer, banks that are reporting pro forma Basel III capital ratios for the end of\n2012 have already reached this minimum standard, as seen in Figure 5.6 Furthermore, many\nof these large banks are now holding more than 8 percent Tier 1 common equity on a pro\nforma basis.\nFigure 6 compares the pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common equity standard relative to\nthe Tier 1 common equity under Basel I. It shows that the Basel III standard results in a much\nlower – and thus more stringent – capital ratio than the Basel I standard, although the\ndifference can vary greatly depending on the business activities of the financial institution and\nthe quality of assets held. Overall, for those banks disclosing pro forma Basel III capital\nratios, the difference between the Basel III pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio and the\nBasel I Tier 1 common equity ratio averages more than 2 percent. It is encouraging that many\nlarge U.S. financial institutions have already reached the minimum Basel III Tier 1 common\nequity standard – which is more restrictive than under Basel I, and is set at higher thresholds.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nIII. Capital and Other Regulatory Tools\nIn the United States the new supervisory tools being employed are far more extensive\nthan just raising minimum capital standards. In conjunction with the SIFI surcharges,\nregulators have undertaken several other significant reforms – including liquidity standards,\nstress tests and resolution plans. Examining capital under stress situations, improved liquidity\nstandards, and resolution plans (the so-called “living wills”) are some of the more important\ninnovations that complement the higher capital standards.\nOur results highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach. None of\nthese tools were used before the crisis, and they are likely to be increasingly important tools\nas regulators and financial institutions gain more experience with them. Thus any historical\nexamination of capital erosion may not fully reflect the many changes that have occurred at\nfinancial institutions and in supervision and regulation in recent years.\nIt is also worthwhile considering how the various new supervisory tools could be\ncombined for enhanced impact. For example, one possibility is to make the trade-off between\nhigher capital and the ability to easily resolve large institutions more explicit. One reason for\nimposing a SIFI surcharge is that large, complicated banks are likely to cause problems that\nspill over throughout the financial system (and by extension the economy) if they need to be\nresolved. Smaller banks are usually resolved over a weekend, with most of the assets and\nliabilities transferred to an acquiring bank. However, such a process is not always feasible for\nlarge institutions – as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers. The failure of Lehman\nBrothers disrupted other financial intermediaries, seriously impaired functioning of a number\nof markets, precipitated runs on other financial intermediaries, and highlighted the need for\nbetter resolution of large institutions.7 To address this risk, difficult-to-resolve large\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\ninstitutions could receive a higher SIFI surcharge than those large institutions that are more\neasily resolvable.8 Such an approach would both encourage large firms to enhance their\nresolvability and would further reduce the probability of failure for remaining difficult-toresolve institutions.\nThus, the cost to society of disruptive failures of systemically important institutions\nwarrants that these institutions hold more capital – and indeed the Basel III accord is already\nimposing capital surcharges for large and difficult-to-resolve institutions. At this point the\nresolution process is new and untried. However, presumably SIFI surcharges should reflect in\npart how successful resolution plans are likely to be.\nContrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that even\nunder the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge does\nnot appear excessive. Given the losses in excess of 450 basis points at a number of large\ninstitutions during the last financial crisis, minimum standards for large institutions may be\ntoo low.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe changes to supervision and regulation since the financial crisis have been\nextensive. Many of those changes are not yet fully implemented, and many of the regulatory\ntools remain untried during times of stress. Nonetheless, U.S. financial institutions are now\nwell placed to finance the economic recovery, as many of the institutions have already\nrecapitalized.\nDespite the dramatic improvement in bank capital positions, examination of capital\nerosion during the financial crisis highlights how large and quick the capital erosion was at\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nsome of the largest financial institutions. While the SIFI surcharges have the potential for\nproviding even more of a capital buffer for the largest institutions, it will be critically\nimportant to determine how other tools such as stress tests, tougher liquidity requirements,\nand resolution plans supplement the higher and more stringent capital standards.\nThe high levels of government support during the financial crisis were problematic.\nGovernment authorities don't want to be in a position of having to provide support again, and\nin fact, might not be able to so. And it is certainly in the industry's best interest not to need\ngovernment support. That makes the enactment of effective capital regimes all the more\nimportant.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nFor a discussion of originate-to-distribute see Board and Santos of the New York Fed at\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/12v18n2/1207bord.pdf\n2\n\nGenerally speaking, the study took starting capital ratio levels which were adjusted to reflect Basel III estimates\nand measured the impact to capital during the financial institution's crisis period resulting from net losses and\nchanges in major regulatory capital accounts, including: goodwill, deferred tax assets, gains/losses resulting from\nown credit risk, and changes in the value of “available for sale” securities.\n3\n\nNote that these crisis periods may differ across institutions given differences in business activities and\naccounting treatment of losses.\n4\n\nFor background see: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104bb.pdf, notably “ iii)\nRequirements for banks determined to be globally systemically important to have additional loss absorption\ncapacity tailored to the impact of their default, rising from 1% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (with an empty\nbucket of 3.5% to discourage further systemicness), to be met with common equity;…”\n5\n\nFour measures of capital are referenced in Figures 3 and 4, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital,\nTier 1 common capital, and tangible common equity:\nTotal risk-based capital includes core capital elements (Tier 1 capital) plus supplementary capital elements\n(Tier 2 capital).\nTier 1 risk-based capital is defined in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies: RiskBased Measures (12 CFR part 225, Appendix A) as the sum of core capital elements less any amounts of\ngoodwill, other intangible assets, interest-only strips receivables, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity\ninvestments, and other items that are required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix.\nTier 1 capital must represent at least 50 percent of qualifying total capital.” The specific elements included in\nTier 1 capital and their various limits, restrictions, and deductions are discussed in detail in 12 CFR part 225,\nAppendix A.\nTier 2 capital includes supplementary items such as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Business and Industry Association of\nNew Hampshire and the New Hampshire\nBankers Association\nSaint Anselm College, Manchester, NH\nMarch 27, 2013\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back in New Hampshire to discuss the economic outlook\nwith you. While economic growth was modest in the latter part of 2012, recent data\nsuggest some improvement in the first part of this year. On balance economic growth has\nbeen a bit better than expected, considering the notable headwinds of fiscal restraint and\nissues in Europe that reflect the still-fragile global recovery. The current expectation of\nmany private-sector forecasters is that the economy will expand slightly more rapidly\nthan its potential rate of growth in the near term.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nStill, the economy remains far from where we want it to be, especially given the\nFed’s dual mandate for maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The\nnational unemployment rate is 7.7 percent, far higher than the 5.25 percent\nunemployment rate to which I think the economy will eventually return. Similarly, the\ninflation rate (measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index or PCE)\nover the twelve months ending in January 2013 averaged only 1.2 percent, far below the\nFederal Reserve’s PCE inflation target of 2 percent.\nToday, I will discuss both the economic outlook and the role that monetary policy\nhas played in the improving economy. Certainly the “no free lunch” doctrine applies\nhere, so along with the benefits there are some potential costs. I will discuss some of the\npotential costs of our current policies, particularly those dealing with financial stability.\nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\nTo preview my conclusions, I will argue that the Federal Reserve’s policy of\nopen-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities –\ncurrently proceeding at a pace of $85 billion a month – has contributed importantly to the\ngradual improvement in labor markets that we have seen, despite the fiscal headwinds. I\nwill also argue that the costs of these policies are outweighed by their benefits, and by the\ncosts likely to result if we did not pursue them.\nIt is clear to me that monetary policy actions have been benefiting the economy.\nSome observers argue that the beneficial effects are offset by the cost of reduced financial\nstability. Certainly, this is an area we need to watch closely. Financial stability is\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nexceptionally important to me personally, as my research and talks underscore. I have\nbeen vocal about significant policy actions that, in my view, should be taken to avoid\nfinancial stability problems in the future. However, I see little evidence that our\nmonetary policies are generating significant financial stability problems at this time.\nPut simply, the benefits of our asset purchases have exceed any reasonable\nestimate of the costs. The asset-purchase program is having the desired impact, and the\nfaster economic growth that is in part the result of monetary policy actions will bring us\nmore quickly to a situation where this degree of additional accommodation is no longer\nnecessary.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nI expect the economy to grow at a rate a bit above 2 percent in the first half of this\nyear, despite the headwinds resulting from more fiscal austerity than many expected. As\nFigure 1 shows, government spending, a GDP component, has declined for the past two\nyears – even before the federal sequester. This is true for federal spending as well as\nstate and local government spending. Fiscal austerity has been offset in part by\nimprovements in housing and also auto sales (part of consumer durables). Housing and\nautos are the most interest-sensitive components of GDP, and their strength partly reflects\nthe positive impact of Federal Reserve policies to push long-term interest rates down with\nour large-scale asset purchase program.\nFigure 2 provides the longer-run economic forecasts of the 19 Reserve Bank\npresidents and Federal Reserve Board governors who participate on the FOMC, taken\nfrom the periodic report known as the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP.1 Once\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\na quarter, each FOMC participant is asked to provide an economic forecast for a variety\nof variables, including the unemployment rate and the PCE inflation rate.\nIn the left panel, the range and midpoint of forecasts for unemployment at the end\nof 2013 and 2014 are provided for the most recent FOMC meeting, in March, and for the\nFOMC meeting last September when we began the open-ended purchases of mortgagebacked securities. Last September the FOMC participants expected the unemployment\nrate at the end of 2013 would range from 7 to 8 percent, with a midpoint of 7.5. At the\nMarch FOMC meeting the range from the SEP was narrower and lower – the range was\nnow from 6.9 to 7.6 percent, and the midpoint had dropped by 25 basis points.\nMy own forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is just above the\nmidpoint of the range. Similarly, the forecast range for unemployment at the end of 2014\nis now lower, and the midpoint fell by 30 basis points to 6.6 percent. For 2014, my\nforecast is again just a bit above the midpoint. In sum, FOMC participants see\nimprovement in the unemployment forecast since last September – for both 2013 and\n2014. And, comparing the midpoints of the unemployment rate forecast for the two years\nshows that the overall level has declined, but the size of the decline expected over 2014 is\nthe same – six tenths.\nTurning to the right-side panel, the midpoint of the PCE inflation forecast for\nFOMC participants fell from 1.8 to 1.65 for 2013 between the September FOMC and the\nMarch FOMC meetings. Furthermore, the midpoint forecast for 2014 fell from 1.9 to\n1.75. My own forecast is below the midpoint of the range for both 2013 and 2014.\nIn sum, the March SEP was quite positive, with declines in the midpoint of the\nforecast ranges for both unemployment and PCE inflation, in 2013 and 2014. However,\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neven at the end of 2014, unemployment is expected to be almost 1.5 percentage points\nabove most estimates of full employment. Given that the midpoint for the inflation\nforecast for both years is below our 2 percent target, I believe we have the flexibility to\npursue a policy that encourages faster economic growth and a more rapid improvement in\nthe unemployment rate. To me, that implies that we should continue our large-scale asset\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities through this year – although the\namount may need to be adjusted up or down, depending on how the economic situation\nevolves.\n\nBenefits and Costs of Large-Scale Asset Purchases\nThe Fed’s purchases of long-term securities are intended to lower longer-term\ninterest rates, like rates on home mortgages and auto loans, in order to promote faster\neconomic growth. These purchases also encourage households and businesses to shift\nsomewhat from riskless low-yielding short-term government securities to investments\nthat bear a sensible degree of risk and have a stronger economic effect, like corporate\nbonds and stocks.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston staff use two different models to estimate the\nimpact of asset purchases on the economy. One explicitly articulates household and\nbusiness behaviors2 and the other is a purely statistical model.3 Reassuringly, both\nmodels give similar results. Our best estimate implies roughly a one-quarter-point\ndecrease in the unemployment rate for a $500 billion asset-purchase program.\nBy this estimate, the benefits of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program\ninclude almost 400,000 additional workers employed for every $500 billion in purchased\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nassets (which earn a return while on the Fed’s books), returning to our inflation target\nsomewhat more quickly, and a somewhat better debt-to-GDP ratio as a result of the lower\ninterest rates and improved GDP and revenue growth. While these estimates are model\ndependent, and are clearly subject to estimation error, they are broadly consistent with\nother studies – and with the growth in asset prices and the expansion of the interestsensitive components of GDP seen since last September.\nOne of the potential costs of LSAPs would be that they could be viewed as\ninflationary. Most of the original critics of LSAPs voiced concerns over the potential\nimpact on inflation and inflation expectations. However, the expansion of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet began in 2008 and five years later we currently have a PCE\ninflation rate of 1.2 percent, well below our 2 percent target. As the years have passed\nand inflation has remained stable, this criticism has become more muted.\nFOMC participants seem to agree with the assessment: looking at the range of\nFOMC participant forecasts from the SEP for March, most FOMC participants expect us\nto undershoot our 2 percent target this year. And in 2014, while the range extends to 2.1,\nmost indicate that inflation would be between 1.5 and 2.0 percent, undershooting or\nachieving the target (an observation based on the published central tendency of 1.5 to 2.0\npercent).\nA second concern expressed about LSAPs is that they might undermine financial\nstability. For example, if one expects the Fed to hold short-term rates at zero for a long\ntime, one could choose to earn higher yields by taking on substantially more credit risk or\ninterest rate risk.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIt is true that the Fed’s low interest rate policies are intended in part to encourage\nadditional, responsible risk-taking of the sort that advances real economic activity and\ngrowth – for example, spurring banks to lend more rather than hold cash or government\nsecurities, and non-financial firms to seek higher-return investment opportunities rather\nthan hold cash or government securities. However, it is possible that the expectation of\nvery low interest rates could encourage too much risk-taking – in the form of excessive\nleverage, or taking credit risks that could not withstand another economic slowdown.\nWhile some households or firms may choose to take excessive risks, even with more\nnormalized interest rates, it is the widespread taking of excessive risk – particularly by\nleveraged institutions – that is likely to generate macroeconomic financial stability\nproblems.\nSome observers have noted that stock prices have risen quite substantially, as\nshown in Figure 3. Of course our policy doesn’t specifically target a particular asset\nmarket, but encouraging investors and firms to take more of the responsible risks that\ncontribute to economic activity and growth would normally mean a shift into assets such\nas stocks and investments with higher expected returns.\nMake no mistake, this would pose a financial stability problem if stock prices had\nsignificantly outstripped likely earnings – particularly if those investing in stocks had\nbecome highly leveraged and were particularly susceptible to a reversal in share prices.\nFigure 4 shows the S&P stock index relative to composite operating earnings over the\npast 20 years. While share prices have risen, so have operating earnings. And while\nthere has been some increase in the ratio, it remains well below the 20-year average.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOther observers have noted that residential real estate prices have risen\nsignificantly in some markets, and that this could pose a financial stability problem.\nSince homes are normally purchased with significant debt, a rapid increase in prices\ncould risk a repeat of the problems of the past decade. Figure 5 looks at the Case-Shiller\nhome price index in a variety of metro areas. While housing prices have risen in many\nmarkets recently, they remain well below their peak prices.4 Furthermore, if one\ncompares an index of house prices to a rent index (shown in Figure 6), assessing whether\nthe values of homes are approximately in line with the services that housing provides, as\nreflected in rental rates, house prices have now fallen enough that this ratio is back to\nwhere it was in 1993, well before the run-up in house prices.\nAnother area of potential concern has been the increase in high-yield bond\nissuance. As Figure 7 shows, high-yield bond rates are now quite low by historical\nstandards. Firms with high-yield bonds are refinancing those bonds, much like many\nhomeowners have refinanced their houses. This refinancing improves the cash flow of\ncompanies and makes them more able to weather shocks. However, if these yields are\nlow because investors are bidding aggressively for such bonds, reaching or over-reaching\nfor higher yields in a low interest rate environment, then one would expect to see highyield bond rates fall more than relatively safe rates, reflecting the strong desire to take on\nmore of this debt at lower yields, despite its higher risk.\nBut Figure 8 shows that while the rates have fallen, the decline has largely been\ndue to the decline in all longer-term interest rates, including safe Treasury rates. The\nspread between high-yield bonds and 10-year Treasury securities is currently a little\nbelow the average spread over nearly two decades.5 That means that high-yield rates\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhave fallen approximately in line with the rates on safe assets, implying stable rather than\nsignificantly diminished compensation for risk. As Figure 9 shows, high-yield bond rates\nhave been declining in a manner quite similar to other rates, such as rates on home\nmortgages and auto loans.\nAnother way of looking at this data is that it highlights that the Fed’s program of\npurchasing long-term securities has affected a wide range of financial markets – from\nsafe Treasuries to mortgages to auto loans, well beyond the specific market where the\npurchases are occurring. Thus, the decline in high-yield bond rates looks broadly in line\nwith other market rates, and the widespread rate declines are contributing to a faster\nrecovery than we would otherwise have seen.\nAnother potential area of concern is banking. Asset price declines have much\ngreater economic impact if the assets are held by highly leveraged financial institutions\nthat may respond to losses by reducing credit availability.\nBut here the news is somewhat encouraging as well. Figure 10 shows the capital\nratios for the largest banks. Since the financial crisis in 2008, banks have restored their\ncapital ratios and have raised capital levels much higher than they were prior to the crisis\nand recession.6 This reflects both the banks’ tightening of their own capital levels, and\nthe impact of our stress tests which reveal whether banks are holding sufficient capital to\nweather an adverse economic, interest rate, or market shocks. The increased scrutiny of\ncapital and liquidity at banks has made banks much better positioned to withstand\npotential future economic shocks.\nEven with more capital and liquidity, however, banks can experience difficulties\nif they have very large positions in asset classes that could experience sharp declines in\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprices. Some observers have noted that farmland prices have experienced significant\nincreases in prices over the past several years. Figure 11 provides the banking industry’s\nexposure to agricultural loans by bank size. The largest banks have relatively small\nexposures to agricultural loans, less than 1 percent for the largest two categories (banks\nexceeding $1 trillion in assets and banks from $100 billion to $1 trillion in assets).\nFurthermore, in some parts of the country, like New England, and in urban based areas,\nbanks’ exposure to agricultural loans is quite modest.\nHowever, in agricultural areas of the country, some smaller banks have a\nsignificant exposure to agricultural loans. Such exposures are unlikely to pose financial\nstability concerns that affect the nation. In such circumstances, raising interest rates on\nall household and business borrowers, as some have suggested might be appropriate in\nresponse to a boom even in such a narrowly-held sector, seems to me a very blunt tool to\naddress this exposure. Instead, this seems a particularly good area for continued,\nenhanced supervisory focus with individual banks – with large agricultural exposures\nbeing challenged by bank supervisors to ensure the banks have sufficient capital to\nsustain a theoretical reversal in farmland prices.\nIn sum, broad-based financial stability concerns do not seem particularly acute at\nthis time. Interest rates in most markets have fallen, and asset prices are rising. This is\nthe expected and intentional result of the Fed’s efforts to promote a more rapid return to\nmore normalized conditions. As the economy continues to improve, and labor markets\nand inflation return to more normalized levels, the recent levels of monetary\naccommodation can be reduced.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThis is not to say we should not be vigilant about potential financial stability\nconcerns. We should remain humble about our ability to detect such imbalances, given\nour failure to do so in the recent crisis. Thus we should closely monitor whether the high\ndegree of monetary accommodation is having unintended consequences. I would now\nlike to briefly discuss some particular financial stability concerns that I believe should be\nwatched carefully.\n\nFinancial Stability Monitoring and the Need for Additional Regulatory Focus\nWhile the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy has been an\nimportant driver of the current economic recovery, and the financial stability costs appear\nrelatively modest at this time, we cannot be Pollyannas. There are areas that we should\nclosely monitor. Some areas that bear watching, in my view, are specific markets where\nunderwriting standards are slipping – or where rapid growth in financial products could\nbecome a more significant concern.\nIn terms of underwriting standards, the covenant quality on new high-yield bond\nissuance should be closely monitored. Bond covenants are intended to protect investors,\nand the issuance of bonds that reduce or eliminate common covenants in their contracts\ncould become an area of concern. In fact, there is some evidence that some new bond\nissuance reduces covenants that protect investors.7\nAlso, financial structures that involve the use of short-term borrowing to finance\nlonger-term assets should be monitored carefully. For example, agency real estate\ninvestment trusts (agency REITS) have grown rapidly, involve leverage, and are\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsusceptible to sharp interest rate movements. Such financing structures need to be\nmonitored to ensure they do not pose broader financial stability concerns.\nFinally, many non-depository financial institutions that were susceptible to runs\nduring the financial crisis still have not resolved that run risk. For example, money\nmarket mutual funds experienced a severe run requiring substantial government\nintervention during the crisis, yet the regulatory reform effort is moving only slowly.\nSimilarly, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo8 and New York Fed President\nWilliam Dudley9 have raised concerns about broker-dealers and wholesale funding\nmarkets. These concerns have substantial merit and deserve attention.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion and in sum, the economy continues to improve, but at a painfully\nslow pace. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve to speed up the pace of the economic\nrecovery seem to be having the desired impact. Interest-sensitive sectors are growing\nmore rapidly, asset markets are returning to pre-crisis levels, and economic forecasters\nare expecting continued improvements over the next several years.\nWhile the benefits of our actions continue to outweigh the costs, we need to\nclosely monitor financial instruments, financial institutions, and financial markets for\npotentially emerging financial stability concerns. There are areas that I have highlighted\ntoday that require close monitoring – including, unfortunately, some problems in\nfinancial market that were significant contributors to the financial crisis but have not yet\nbeen fully remedied.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile the economy is improving, global financial conditions remain fragile, as\nevents in Europe are highlighting. And the economy still has a long way to go before we\nhave full employment and PCE inflation at about 2 percent. Still, I believe the Federal\nReserve will continue to do its part in this process, with a clear focus on improving\neconomic conditions for all Americans.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe complete Summary of Economic Projections is released with the minutes of the FOMC meeting three\nweeks after the date of the policy decision. Table 1 of the SEP, containing the economic projections, is\nreleased in advance, following the FOMC meeting at the time of the Chairman’s press conference. Table 1\ncontains the range and central tendency of the projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, PCE\ninflation, and core inflation.\n\n2\n\nIn other words is more structural in nature.\n\n3\n\nA parsimonious vector autoregression model.\n\n4\n\nAn exception is Denver, which did not experience a substantial decline.\n\n5\n\nMore precisely, over the 17 years from March 1996 to the present – the period for which the data series\nwas available.\n6\n\nQuality of capital has also improved, in addition to quantity. There has also been a significant\nimprovement in the quality of capital as evidenced by the large increase in the more narrowly-defined\ntangible capital. Tangible capital, which is more readily available to absorb losses than some broader\nmeasures of capital, increased from 2.4% of tangible assets at the close of 2008 to 6.9% of tangible assets\nat the close of 2012 for the same group of large U.S. banking organizations used in the Tier 1 common\ncapital ratio pictured in Figure 10.\n\n7\n\nThe covenant quality decline (or the rise of “covenant lite” arrangements) is present in both leveraged\nloans and high yield bonds.\n8\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm\n\n9\n\nSee http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130201.html\n\n13\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nEarly Childhood Summit 2013: Innovation and\nOpportunity\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston,\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 5, 2013\n\nI am pleased to be participating in this early childhood summit. And I would\nparticularly like to thank the Boston Children’s Museum for continuing its tradition of\ninnovative work on behalf of children by co-sponsoring this and other events during this\ntheir centennial year. The Boston Children’s Museum is a close neighbor of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, and my children and I personally benefitted from this proximity\nas we often took advantage of its many exhibits and programs. It was the only museum\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat my children did not respond with, “not another museum” when I told them where we\nwere going that day.\nI became aware of some of the important economic work being done on early\nchildhood programs in a series of discussions I had over the years with fellow Fed\neconomist, Art Rolnick. Art was then the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Minneapolis and made two important observations. First, if you help someone early in\nlife, they reap a lifetime of benefits. And a second close corollary is that programs that\nhelp kids learn have a high return for them as individuals and for society as a whole.\nThese observations have been validated by good empirical research and have served as a\nfoundation for the funding of important programs that apply these observations. Others\non the agenda today are going to discuss such programs in more detail.\nWhile many of the economic studies on the value of good early childhood\nprograms have focused on the average return from these investments, I am going to\ndiscuss how educational attainment can impact the variability of a person’s economic\noutcomes. In particular, during economic downturns, those with poor educational\nattainment are disproportionately likely to become unemployed and that unemployment\ncan have a far-reaching impact on other aspects of life, including expected future\nearnings, wealth and home ownership.\nThe second point I will emphasize today is the importance of helping those\ncommunities that have the fewest resources available to address both economic and social\nproblems. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been doing significant work in midsized cities in New England, and we will be announcing a new mid-sized cities initiative\nin Massachusetts next month in conjunction with a number of partners including the\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, Living Cities, and the Massachusetts Competitive\nPartnership. Today I want to highlight that if you are living in a mid-sized city in\nMassachusetts with a high poverty rate, your chances of educational attainment look\nquite different from what they would be if you lived in a mid-sized city with a low\npoverty rate. While there has been progress in more widespread adoption of early\nchildhood education – especially in reaching communities that have difficulty affording\nsuch programs – it is exactly these communities that potentially generate the highest\nreturns on such investment. This is particularly important because these investments not\nonly influence educational attainment as a youth, but can be an important element in\nemployment opportunities and job retention as an adult, even during difficult economic\ntimes, such as those we continue to experience.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Variability of Economic Outcomes\nFigure 1 displays the unemployment rate by educational attainment. First, notice\nthat the unemployment rate for less educated workers is always significantly higher than\nthe rate for more highly educated workers. Second, while the unemployment rate\napproximately doubled during the Great Recession across all education categories, the\nunemployment rates of people with low educational attainment rose to staggering levels.\nFor those with less than a high school education, the unemployment rate was a bit below\n8 percent prior to the recession and reached a peak of almost 16 percent as a result of the\nrecession. Thus, nearly one in six people with less than a high school education were\nunemployed at one point during the recession. Thankfully, the unemployment rate for\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthose with low educational attainment has come down, despite the only modest overall\nrecovery we have had to date.\nWhile it is well established that spells of unemployment have a significant\nnegative impact on labor income for years, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff recently\nexamined the impact that a long duration of unemployment has on future labor income.1\nTheir research found that 10 years after a spell of unemployment, an individual makes 16\npercent less on average than an individual who did not experience that spell of\nunemployment. The impact is even larger with longer-duration unemployment. After 20\nyears, the earnings of a short-duration unemployed worker are roughly the same as those\nwithout a spell of unemployment, but the individual with a long-duration spell of\nunemployment is still somewhat worse off. Furthermore, there is no “catch up” for the\nyears of lost income. It is important to note that our staff found that longer-duration\nunemployment is negatively correlated with education.\nNot surprisingly, those lost opportunities result in unfavorable collateral effects.\nFor example, spells of unemployment have a significantly negative impact on future\nhomeownership rates, and those who experience a period of long-duration unemployment\nhave a significant permanent loss in wealth.2 Spells of unemployment also entail huge\nnon-pecuniary costs to the individual and the family.\nSuch observations are important in a variety of contexts, but let me mention two.\nIn terms of monetary policy, it implies that spells of unemployment can have a lasting\nimpact long after the economy recovers. If spells of unemployment have a persistent\nimpact on income, wealth and home ownership, then a more aggressive response to\npersistently high unemployment rates is warranted. More rapid economic growth is\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlikely to not only reduce the unemployment rate, but also reduce some of the collateral\ndamage the economy may otherwise face from the spells of long-duration unemployment.\nContinued accommodative policy, such as continuing our asset purchase program\nthrough this year, is an appropriate response to labor market scarring.\nParticularly relevant for today’s discussion is that the failure to help children\nreach their highest potential educational attainment level can have a significant impact on\ntheir likelihood of experiencing significant economic shocks when the economy\nexperiences a downturn. This much greater risk of unemployment as an adult for the\nchild who does not receive a sufficient education impacts a variety of other economic\noutcomes, such as whether an individual can buy a home or accumulate wealth to afford a\nreasonable retirement or educate their children.\nA critical factor in obtaining sufficient education in many disadvantaged areas is\nthe availability of programs that help maximize a child’s potential. Government cuts that\ndo not consider the long-run return on investment from such programs are likely to be\nboth economically inefficient and could potentially cause longer-run harm to the\neconomy.\n\nA Comparison of Massachusetts Cities\nI would like to highlight differences in educational attainment by examining\nMassachusetts mid-sized cities with the highest poverty rates versus those with the lowest\npoverty rates.3 These charts demonstrate that patterns in failure to obtain a high school\neducation actually are fairly persistently present in the data by educational outcome at\nmuch earlier ages.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 2 shows the differences in the share of children under age five living below\nthe poverty level, comparing those cities with the lowest overall poverty rates to those\nwith the highest poverty rates as well as to the statewide average for all cities and towns.\nIn four of the five high poverty mid-sized cities, more than 40 percent of the children\nunder age five are living below the poverty level. In all five cities, the share of children\nunder age five living below the poverty level is more than double the average for\nMassachusetts. Among the cities with the lowest poverty rates, four of the five cities\nhave child poverty rates less than half the Massachusetts average of 16.8 percent.\nFigure 3 shows that differences for children occur as early as three or four years\nof age. In the low poverty mid-sized cities, 67.7% of children age three and four are\nenrolled in a preschool or pre-kindergarten program. In contrast, less than half – 42.6% –\nof children age three and four are enrolled in school in the high poverty mid-sized cities.\nLawrence has the lowest share at 26.8%.\nFigure 4 shows that the patterns of enrollment visible in Figure 3 are quite similar\nto the patterns in third grade Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)\ntest scores. Cities with high poverty rates report much lower scores on both the reading\nand math MCAS tests, sometimes having less than half the proficiency rate of cities with\nlow poverty rates. Though there are many population differences between high and low\npoverty mid-sized cities that can affect test scores, it appears that early school enrollment\nis a critical factor that clearly has an effect on student achievement.4\nFigure 5 shows that these patterns persist with high school graduation rates. In all\nfive low poverty cities, 80 percent or more of students graduate from high school in four\nyears. In all five high poverty cities, less than 70 percent of students graduate from high\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nschool in four years. In four of the five high poverty cities, the high school graduation\nrate is 61 percent or lower. This has implications for future earning power, as those who\ndo not graduate from high school earn much less on average than those with higher\neducational attainment. As I highlighted in the beginning of my talk, this also has\nsignificant implications for the likelihood of experiencing a spell of unemployment with\nthe associated collateral impact. Thus, not only the stream of earnings but also the\nvolatility of earnings may be impacted.\nChildren in high poverty cities face considerable challenges on many levels.\nHowever, access to educational opportunities can have a significant impact on their\neconomic outcomes throughout their lives. Given the discrepancies between childhood\noutcomes related to education, both public and private resources need to be focused on\nproviding more educational and developmental opportunities for children living in cities\nwith fewer resources, resources that have been particularly strained over the past five\nyears.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe work of this conference is important. There is more to be done to make sure\nthat all children have the opportunity to succeed and flourish. Educational opportunity is\nan important element in the likelihood of that happening.\nI do want to end on a positive note. Figure 6 shows that there has been a\nsignificant increase in the number of children with access to full day kindergarten.\nResearch and policy advocacy regarding early childhood education has had an impact,\nand resources from private and public sources are increasingly providing more\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neducational opportunities for children. However, as my charts indicate, more work needs\nto be done, and I hope all of us in this room will do our part to make that happen.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThis research was included in a March 13, 2013 memo by Daniel Cooper, Senior Economist at\n\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, titled “Effects of Employment Duration on Earnings and Other\nOutcomes.”\n2\n\nIt is important to emphasize that one cannot perfectly distinguish between extended\n\nunemployment spells that result from “sorting” in the labor market, such that less-productive workers are\nthe first unemployed and the last to find new jobs, versus bad luck on the part of a productive employee\nwhose firm failed. But one only needs to assume that a modest portion of these long-duration\nunemployment spells reflect the bad luck case to arrive at sizable long-run impacts of extended\nunemployment.\n3\n\nTo select the mid-sized cities in Massachusetts with the highest and lowest poverty rates, cities\n\nwith population of 35,000 – 200,000 were sorted by population poverty rate (the share of all people whose\nincome was below the poverty level), using the three-year estimates for 2009 – 2011 from the American\nCommunity Survey (ACS).\n4\n\nIn addition, reading at grade level in third grade has been correlated with a reduction in later\n\ndropout rates.\n\n8\n\n\f",

        "content": "“Should Full Employment Be\nA Mandate For Central Banks?”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 57th Economic\nConference:\n“Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate – Monetary Policy & The\nLabor Market”\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 12, 2013\nThe data in this speech have been updated to reflect revisions to the data series that occurred\nafter it was delivered. These updates were made because the speech was being prepared for\npublication in an issue of the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking.\n\nIt is a pleasure to welcome everyone attending the Boston Fed’s 57th economic\nconference. The topic of this year’s conference – fulfilling the full employment mandate – is\nparticularly relevant today, when most developed countries have unemployment rates\nsubstantially above their estimates of full employment.\nI see a number of important questions about the full employment mandate that should be\nexplored at this conference and beyond. For example, how should central banks react to high\nunemployment rates in a period of well-anchored inflation expectations? Does the\nunconventional nature of many of the monetary policy tools currently being employed alter how\n\n1\n\n\fcentral banks should think about their mandate? And even more fundamentally, what should be\nthe mandate of central banks – should there be a single inflation goal, as occurs in many\ncountries around the world, or should there be a dual mandate as has evolved in the United\nStates?\nMy answer to this last question is an emphatic yes, by the way – the Fed should have a\ndual mandate. But I expect that conference participants and those reading the papers and\npresentations from afar will gain fresh perspectives on these and other important questions.\nBefore I begin my remarks I would like to note that the views I express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nIn the United States, we currently have an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent and an\ninflation rate of 1.5 percent using the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index.\nFalling short on both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – inflation\nand employment – provides a strong rationale for continuing our highly accommodative\nmonetary policy. With inflation at 1.5 percent, and with my own forecast that inflation will\nremain well below our 2 percent target over the next two years, one could argue that consistently\nmissing our inflation target alone would justify a highly accommodative policy. However,\ncoupled with persistently high unemployment, the justification for continuing highly\naccommodative policy by large-scale asset purchases is clear. This is a time when the dual\nmandate is important and, I would add, particularly useful for communicating policy to the\ngeneral public.\nThe dual mandate is being utilized in recent Federal Reserve policy statements to clearly\ndescribe to the public how monetary policy will be conducted, going forward. In particular,\n\n2\n\n\frecent FOMC policy statements have made explicit reference to the role of employment in\nconsidering changes to our monetary policy stance. With regard to the Fed’s large-scale asset\npurchase program, the March statement said the FOMC will continue purchases “until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”\nThe FOMC statement highlights that maintaining interest rates at exceptionally low\nlevels will be appropriate “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage\npoint above the Committee’s 2 percent long-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations\ncontinue to be well anchored.” Data for both inflation and unemployment measures are readily\navailable, and with the publication four times a year of the Committee’s projections for these\nvariables via the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) 1 the public can observe the FOMC’s\noutlook for these measures as well.\nBoth inflation and unemployment are viewed by the public as important gauges of\neconomic well-being, so tying the trajectory of policy to data and published forecasts for these\neconomic outcomes clarifies things for the public. In fact, this type of central bank\ncommunication has been quite effective. With a clearer understanding of the policy objective,\nyield curves have flattened and forward rates have fallen to reflect policy announcements.\nSuch announcements would likely not be as straightforward in countries with a single\nmandate related only to inflation. In such countries, a modest shortfall in inflation relative to\ntarget would not by itself justify a significant monetary policy response. In circumstances such\nas today’s, invoking a non-mandated “escape clause” to attend to real activity while inflation is\nwell-contained would not do justice to the size of the problems in the real economy. To be sure,\nmany countries have found ways around these difficulties in recent times, but the Federal\n\n3\n\n\fReserve’s dual mandate is especially well suited for times like these, when it is clear that the\nprimary rationale for our aggressive policies derives from the first-order problems in labor\nmarkets, not from a second-order escape clause that “permits” (but does not mandate) monetary\npolicymakers to consider labor markets.\nGiven the communication challenges that are present with a single inflation mandate at a\ntime of a significant slack in resources (high unemployment), it is natural to ask if there are\nsignificant differences in how central banks with a single inflation mandate behave relative to\ncentral banks with a dual mandate. The conclusion I will reach – by looking at the data – is that\nwith a dual mandate in the United States, our inflation outcomes have been at least as good as\nthose in countries with a single mandate, and we have the added benefit of a much clearer and\nmore direct way to communicate with the public.\nI would note that several nations have been considering revisiting their central bank\nmandate. The evidence I will share with you today suggests that there should be a broader\nconsideration of moving to a dual mandate, such as we have in the United States.\nTo give you an overview of my presentation today, I will first explore whether countries\nwith a single mandate, focused solely on inflation, generate different outcomes. Then I will\nexplore the issue of central bank actions when inflation exceeds the target. I will follow with a\ndiscussion of current policy in the United States and the role played by the dual mandate, before\noffering some concluding observations.\n\nDo Countries with a Single Inflation Mandate Generate Better Outcomes?\nThe first matter I would like to explore is the inflation experience of single mandate\nversus dual mandate countries. The data show that many countries over the past 20 years have\n\n4\n\n\fbeen very close to a 2 percent average inflation rate over that period; a result that is surprisingly\nconsistent with price level targeting, where large increases or decreases in inflation are offset in\nfuture periods to maintain the same average inflation rate. Interestingly, by this measure the\nUnited States performs a bit better than countries that use only an inflation mandate.\nFigure 1 shows the inflation experience of the U.S., the Euro area, 2 and Japan over the\npast 20 years. The price level for each is indexed to 100 in January of 1993. The Federal\nReserve now has a 2 percent inflation target tied to the PCE inflation index, and the red line\nindicates the path the price level would take if inflation were exactly 2 percent for the entire 20\nyear period (which would be consistent with either error-less inflation targeting or perfect price\nlevel targeting).\nWhile the 2 percent inflation target was only officially adopted by the FOMC in January\n2012, the figure suggests that the Federal Reserve observed an implicit inflation target of 2\npercent over this 20-year period. The actual path followed by the PCE level is represented by the\ndarker blue line. The fact that the PCE price index always returns to the 2 percent line over the\n20-year period implies, naturally, that the average inflation rate over that period was 2 percent.\nAlso, the proximity of the PCE price index to the 2 percent line indicates that inflation deviated\nvery little from 2 percent during that period. The only period of significant divergence occurred\nwhen oil prices rose significantly in 2008, and that divergence clearly proved temporary.\nOne might think that the unexpectedly severe “Great Recession” forced the inflation rate\nback to the 2 percent path. However, it is interesting to note that even before the Great\nRecession, the average was very close to 2 percent. With inflation generally falling at the\nbeginning of this period, the pattern is consistent with a U.S. monetary policy that may not have\n“forgiven” the period of above-target inflation as “water over the dam,” as a 2 percent inflation\n\n5\n\n\ftargeting central bank would, but instead engineered below-2 percent inflation in the ensuing\nperiod, to achieve a 2 percent average inflation rate – much like a price-level targeting central\nbank would.\nThis in turn implies a central bank that was more restrictive following the period of\nabove-2 percent inflation than a pure inflation-targeter would be, potentially leading to a higher\nunemployment rate than would otherwise have been the case. Of course, it is possible that these\ninflation outcomes simply arose from a pattern of exogenous shocks (such as oil shocks) to\ninflation that produced an average inflation rate of 2 percent, in spite of the central bank’s\nactions. But whether this pattern arose by chance or design, the chart is striking. The chart also\nhighlights that during the most recent period of highly elevated unemployment – when we have\nremained persistently below 2 percent inflation – we could have justified even more\naccommodative policy than was generally enacted.\nThe Euro area’s harmonized price level index is shown on the chart in lighter blue.\nWhile also quite close to the 2 percent line, the inflation rate in Europe has tended to be higher\nthan that of the United States, and at the end of the 20-year period is above the 2 percent line,\nand above the inflation index for the United States. Of course, the ECB took control of monetary\npolicy in January 1999, at the inception of the euro, but the statement is still true if one begins\nthis exercise at that time.\nThe other line provides the index for Japan. While recently the Bank of Japan has\ndiscussed a 2 percent inflation target, that does not appear to have been the target over the last 20\nyears. Reflecting the inflation outcome, it would appear that the Bank of Japan has been\nfollowing essentially a zero percent price level target and that the recently announced intent to\n\n6\n\n\fhit a 2 percent target, if implemented, will be a significant change from the past 20 years in\nJapan.\nGiven the very different inflation target and outcome for Japan during much of the last\ntwo decades, I will today focus on countries that have been following a 2 percent inflation target.\nFigure 2 shows the price level path for the U.S., the U.K., and Sweden. Both the U.K. and\nSweden have 2 percent inflation targets, and both remain fairly close to the 2 percent line.\nHowever, at the end of the 20-year period, the U.K. is above the 2 percent line and above the\ninflation experience of the U.S. while Sweden is below. Clearly the United States has yielded no\nworse outcomes on inflation than other countries with a single mandate. 3\nIn terms of inflation outcomes, all countries have been relatively close to the 2 percent\ninflation line (with the exception of Japan), consistent with a move toward well-anchored\nexpectations in all of these countries. However, it is notable that even with a dual mandate the\nUnited States is the country closest to the 2 percent line at the end of the 20-year period.\nIt is, of course, possible that over two decades inflation could average 2 percent, but that\na country with a dual mandate might allow inflationary pressures to build up more than a country\nwhose sole mandate was inflation, leading to more pronounced swings of inflation (and the price\nlevel) around its target. One way to explore this possibility is to examine the cumulative squared\ndeviation of inflation from the 2 percent target – a measure that places greater weight on large\nmisses from the target. Figure 3 provides the cumulative squared deviations of the annual (year\nover year) inflation rate from a 2 percent inflation target. The analysis 4 is symmetric, meaning it\nplaces an equal weight on large misses above 2 percent and similarly on large deviations below 2\npercent.\n\n7\n\n\fThe most rapid increase in the cumulative squared deviation from the inflation target for\nthe United States was in 2008, when rising oil prices caused a sharp increase in energy prices\nthat persisted for several quarters. However, in the period after 2009 the U.S. line really flattens.\nThe unemployment rate remained quite elevated, and the inflation rate stayed quite close to the 2\npercent target and, in fact, is much flatter than in Sweden and the U.K., which have only an\ninflation mandate. In addition, the misses – the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation\ntarget – over the entire period are smaller for the U.S. than for the U.K. or Sweden, but\nsomewhat higher than for the Euro area.\nHowever, since much of the miss in the United States is the result of the temporary spike\nin oil prices in 2008, it is worth examining whether underlying inflation measured by core\ninflation provides the same picture. Core inflation measures exclude the volatile food and\nenergy segments that are obviously very important but are not controllable by central banks.\nFigure 4 provides the cumulative squared deviations of core inflation from a 2 percent target.\nFor the United States we see that the increases in the cumulative squared deviations from the\ninflation target are quite gradual over the entire period. Perhaps even more notable, using core\ninflation the cumulative squared deviations for the U.S. are lower than those of the U.K.,\nSweden, or the Euro area. Furthermore, when the unemployment rate is the highest in the United\nStates, the increases in the cumulative squared deviations are less than in the other three areas.\nNow I’d like to show a figure, first with the countries not labeled and then with them\nlabeled. This figure, Figure 5, provides a scatter chart depicting core inflation and\nunemployment outcomes over the past 16 years. The key question, I would suggest, is whether\ninflation and unemployment outcomes for the United States, with a dual mandate, look\nsignificantly different than for other countries.\n\n8\n\n\fIn terms of quarterly inflation outcomes, both Sweden and the U.K. have more highinflation observations than the United States. Sweden, the U.K., and the Euro area all have a\nhigher range of quarterly inflation outcomes than the United States. In terms of unemployment,\nthe United States has more density in unemployment rates between 4 and 6 percent relative to the\nother three, but the range of unemployment rates is wider than that of the U.K. and Sweden.\nThat the U.S. has a tighter inflation range and a broader unemployment range than many\nother countries with a single inflation mandate is striking, as is the very high unemployment rate\nin Europe. The results suggest that criticism that a dual mandate country might suffer from more\nfrequent and enduring spells of high inflation is overdone – and if anything the evidence might\nraise the question of whether, with a dual mandate, there should have been more aggressive\nmonetary accommodation during periods of elevated unemployment, particularly in the past five\nyears.\nAnother interesting aspect of the analysis shown in Figure 5 is whether the dual mandate\nresults in the United States having a larger concentration of high-inflation outcomes during\nperiods of high unemployment. But the opposite is true, as most of the high-inflation\nobservations occur during periods of low unemployment. Interestingly, for Sweden and the U.K.\nmore of the high-inflation observations are during periods of high unemployment, which might\npartly be attributable to open economies that may be more exposed to exchange rate and energy\nshocks.\nTo summarize, I would note that the dual mandate in the United States has been criticized\nby some for providing an inflationary bias. However, the data show little such evidence.\nInflation outcomes in the United States over the past 15-20 years appear to compare quite\nfavorably to those of single mandate countries.\n\n9\n\n\fCentral Banks’ Actions When Inflation Exceeds the Target\nOne way of capturing differences that might exist between single and dual mandate\ncountries is to examine whether single-mandate central banks were much more reticent to ease\npolicy if unemployment were high and they were currently somewhat above their inflation target.\nSuch an approach can certainly be justified when bound to a single mandate for inflation, but the\njustification for easing policy in such a circumstance would be that the inflation forecast suggests\nthat inflation will return to 2 percent. Contrast this with a dual mandate country, where rather\nthan relying on an inflation forecast that is expected to fall – possibly because of slack resources\n– the central bank can directly appeal to the elevated unemployment rate as balancing the\nconcerns over a somewhat elevated inflation.\nOver the past five years, short-term interest rates in many countries have been close to, or\nat, the zero lower bound. So it may be instructive to explore just how willing countries have\nbeen to expand their central bank’s balance sheet during periods of above-target inflation.\nFigure 6 shows the core rate of inflation in the U.S. and the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet in recent years. The only observations of core inflation above 2 percent were in 2008.\nHowever, this was the period of the most rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\nWith a dual mandate, a period of fast-rising unemployment rates makes it straightforward to\ncommunicate the need to rapidly expand the balance sheet.\nFigure 7 provides similar information for the Bank of England. Unlike the United States,\nthe core inflation rate in the U.K. has been above 2 percent for much of this period.\nInterestingly, the most rapid expansion of the balance sheet occurred in late 2008 when core\ninflation was above 2 percent, and the balance sheet began to grow further in 2011 when\ninflation was well above the 2 percent target. So, despite the single mandate, the Bank of\n\n10\n\n\fEngland has been willing to expand its balance sheet even with core inflation rates persistently\nhigher than target.\nFigure 8 contains similar information for the Euro area and the European Central Bank.\nThe most rapid increase – but not the largest – in the balance sheet was in 2008 when the core\ninflation rate was above 2 percent. While core inflation remained below 2 percent for the rest of\nthe period, the expansion of the balance sheet resumed in 2011 when the core inflation rate was\nat a local maximum very close to 2 percent.\nFigure 9 provides the same information for Sweden. Sweden, like other countries,\nincreased its balance sheet when core inflation was above 2 percent. What is distinctive about\nSweden is the reduction in the central bank’s balance sheet, and how low their balance sheet has\nremained despite being well below 2 percent core inflation.\nThe good news is that periods of higher inflation do not seem to constrain any of these\ncountries from easing monetary policy when the real economy is in serious distress, even if they\nare above a 2 percent inflation target. But again, I would observe that with a dual mandate, the\ncommunication around these periods and policy actions is likely to be much more\nstraightforward. Perhaps a lesson to draw from these episodes is that, regardless of the formal\nstructure of the central bank, all of us are dual mandate banks “at heart.”\n\nCurrent Policy in the United States and the Dual Mandate\nFigure 10 looks at an estimate of the period-by-period loss function for the U.S. central\nbank, proxied by the squared deviations of inflation from an inflation target (not cumulative) in\nthe top panel, and the squared deviations of unemployment from an estimate of full employment\nutilizing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment of the natural rate for each year\n\n11\n\n\f(not cumulative) in the bottom panel. There is no stated inflation target for the United States\nduring much of the sample period, so that during the earlier periods a filter is utilized that\nprovides a smoothed inflation target that ranges from 2 to 5 percent. 5\nFigure 11 stacks the deviations from the previous two charts. The misses from inflation\nare shown in dark blue and the misses from unemployment are in light blue. In effect this\nreflects a loss function that places an equal weight on inflation misses and unemployment\nmisses. Parenthetically, I would point out that an interesting question to consider is whether the\npossibility of long-term effects of unemployment, as will be discussed during this conference,\nshould alter the relative weights of inflation and unemployment in the loss function.\nMost of the large misses in the 1970s and early 1980s were the result of very high\ninflation rates. After the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced inflation rates under the\nleadership of Chairman Volker, inflation has remained well anchored and has not resulted in\nlarge inflation misses. What is more striking is that now the misses have been associated with\nperiods of high unemployment. The Great Recession resulted in such a large miss in\nunemployment that the squared deviations were higher than in any period in the past 30 years.\nEven now, the squared deviations remain at a high point for the past 20 years. This may indicate\nthat during the period of the 1970s and early 1980s too little weight may have been placed on\ninflation misses but in the more recent past we may have placed too little weight on\nunemployment misses – and if anything, we should have acted more aggressively to reduce the\nunemployment rate.\nWith the unemployment rate at 7.5 percent and both core and total PCE inflation at 1.5\npercent, the communication of accommodative monetary policy is quite straightforward. We are\n\n12\n\n\fwell above our unemployment target and well below our inflation target, so highly\naccommodative policy is both appropriate and necessary.\nFurthermore, the dual mandate, coupled with the FOMC’s January “framework”\nstatement, has made it easier to provide forward guidance. The threshold language has clearly\nstated that unemployment is an important objective of monetary policy and an important\ndeterminant of when we will begin to raise short-term interest rates. Similarly, the FOMC\nstatement makes clear that we are looking for substantial improvement in outlook for the labor\nmarket, in a context of price stability, before stopping large-scale asset purchases. Given how far\nwe are below the 2 percent inflation target, these actions could be motivated by large misses on\ninflation – but the dual mandate provides a much clearer, more transparent, and direct way to\ncommunicate with the public.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe dual mandate in the United States has provided a clear and transparent way to\ncommunicate the need for aggressive monetary policy. Our inflation outcomes have been as\ngood as, if not better than, many countries with a single inflation mandate. Furthermore, many\ncentral banks with only a single inflation mandate have chosen to expand monetary policy\naccommodation despite being at or above a 2 percent inflation target.\nThe general similarity of actions across central banks, despite differing mandates, is\nilluminating. Again I would suggest that the dual mandate may have made the communication\naround our actions easier than in single mandate countries. But the historical record shows that\neven this dual mandate central bank may have been a bit slow to place sufficient emphasis on\nunemployment deviations. If that is the case, then as countries consider or reconsider their\n\n13\n\n\fcentral banks’ mandate, moving to a dual mandate may provide dual benefits: on the\ncommunications front, it will make it easier to provide forward guidance that conditions on both\ninflation and employment outcomes. On the policy action front, a dual mandate may help to\nensure that employment gets an appropriate weighting in the central bank’s assessment of\nappropriate policy, particularly during times when employment ranks first in terms of economic\nwoes.

The U.S. is the classic large\nsemi-open economy, while Sweden is close to a classic small open economy; the U.K. and the larger pre-Euro E.U.\ncountries fall somewhere in between. One would expect monetary expansion in a small open economy to cause a\ntemporary increase in measured inflation due to exchange rate depreciation (as the prices of tradables increase) even\nwhen unemployment is above the natural rate (although the inflation increase would be small if there is limited\nexchange rate pass-through).\n4\n\nA quadratic loss function.\n\n5\n\nThe target inflation series is constructed by running a Hodrick-Prescott filter with smoothing parameter 1,600,000\nover the core PCE inflation rate from 1959 to the present.

Minsky Conference\non the State of the U.S. and World Economies\nThe Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nand the Ford Foundation\nNew York, New York\nApril 17, 2013\n\nI am grateful to the Levy Institute for the invitation to take part in a conference\nthat focuses on such a vital goal – building a financial infrastructure that supports a more\nstable and equitable economy.\nBefore I begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that I join you from a\ncommunity in Boston that on Monday endured a terrible and profoundly cruel tragedy, at\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe Marathon. My thoughts are with the many people who were wounded, with those –\nincluding Boston Fed staff – who were uninjured but at the scene, and most of all with\nthe families and friends of those whose lives were lost.\nSo with heavy hearts we turn to the matter at hand, perhaps finding a small bit of\nencouragement in doing work that intends to make things better for all participants in our\neconomy.\nToday I would like to discuss the risk of financial runs – and the implications for\nthe stability of the financial system, which underlies a well-functioning economy. Of\ncourse, I would like to note that the policy views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath have significantly increased the\nattention policymakers devote to financial stability issues. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) and a variety of new bank\nregulatory initiatives, including the Basel III capital accord, are intended to reduce the\nrisk of similar problems in the future. For commercial banks, the policy changes\nstemming from the crisis have been increases in bank capital, stress tests to ensure capital\nis sufficient to weather serious problems, increased attention to liquidity, and new\nmeasures intended to improve the resolution of large systemically important commercial\nbanks.\nWhile these measures are clear steps toward improved financial stability, I believe\nthe actions taken around other, less traditional financial institutions have not moved\nnearly as markedly or at the same pace as the corrective actions taken for commercial\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbanks. This is despite the fact that less traditional financial institutions were at the\nepicenter of the crisis. My comments today will focus on one area that has received less\nattention in the United States than elsewhere – the need to ensure that large brokerdealers will not need to rely on a government safety net in the future.\nThe financial runs that beset highly leveraged institutions, structures, and products\nwere significant and unfortunate features of the financial crisis. While deposit insurance\nreduces the risk that depositors will flee en masse from commercial banks, the financial\ncrisis highlighted that other types of financial institutions and structures were also highly\nsusceptible to runs. For example, money market mutual funds, which are not required to\nhold capital, experienced credit losses and significant investor flight (i.e., runs) during the\ncrisis. Policymakers put in place temporary backstops – insurance funded by the U.S.\nTreasury and a liquidity facility facilitated by the Federal Reserve – to avoid further\ncollateral damage. Since then, there has been much public discussion of regulatory\nactions that could significantly reduce the financial stability concerns around money\nmarket mutual funds – which are regulated by the SEC – but industry opposition has been\nvocal, and no significant actions have as yet been taken.1 Former SEC Chair Schapiro\nwas right to pursue money market fund reform, and now that her successor is confirmed I\nam hopeful that the SEC will revisit this issue.\nStructured investment vehicles (SIVs), which financed long-term, risky financial\nassets with short-term commercial paper, also encountered trouble during the crisis.\nInvestors who were concerned about the valuation of the SIVs’ long-term assets “ran”\nfrom the short-term commercial paper the SIVs issued to finance their assets, causing\nmany SIVs to fail or be wound down.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAdditionally, broker-dealer firms – which were assumed by most observers to\npresent less risk of a run because their borrowing is often fully collateralized – proved\nvulnerable and also played a prominent role during the crisis. However, widespread\nquestions about the appropriate valuation of collateral during the crisis made it apparent\nthat collateral in and of itself was not sufficient to avoid runs.\nBrokers act as agents for others and are defined by the Securities and Exchange\nAct to include those that “engage in the business of effecting transactions in securities for\nthe account of others.”2 Dealers are “engaged in the business of buying and selling\nsecurities for their own account.” Both are regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) and are subject to a variety of regulations including net capital\nrequirements, restrictions on the use of customer accounts, and various accounting and\nreporting requirements.\nBroker-dealers are a critical component of our financial infrastructure. They act\nas “market-makers” in securities, ensuring that markets remain highly liquid and that\nfinancial transactions can be conducted efficiently and effectively. Still, notwithstanding\ntheir market making strengths and capabilities, these organizations were not immune\nfrom the widespread seizing up of markets – and indeed found themselves at the center of\nevents in the financial crisis.\nTwo prominent broker dealers failed at critical junctures during the crisis. The\nfirst major broker-dealer failure involved Bear Stearns. Arguably the most disruptive\nfailure was Lehman Brothers. Emergency loans were provided to Bear Stearns, and in\nthe wake of its assisted merger a variety of emergency credit facilities to backstop the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nindustry were set up. Additional actions were taken, to forestall more widespread runs\nafter the failure of Lehman Brothers.\nDespite the central role that broker-dealers played in exacerbating the crisis, too\nlittle has changed to avoid a repeat of the problem, I am sorry to say. In short, I firmly\nbelieve that a reexamination of the solvency risks of large broker-dealers is warranted.3\nHence, my remarks today will highlight the need for more regulatory focus on\nbroker-dealers. I will begin by discussing the role of broker-dealers and their experience\nduring the financial crisis. I would then like to detail some of the policy actions taken\nduring the crisis – actions that backstopped broker-dealers and prevented further\ncollateral damage. Then I will examine why being housed within a bank holding\ncompany should not obviate the need for the broker-dealer subsidiary to hold more\ncapital. Then I will provide some concluding observations.\n\nBroker-Dealers and the Financial Crisis\nSome of the largest broker-dealers serve as a counterparty to the Federal Reserve\nwhen the Fed buys and sells securities – performs so-called “open market operations” –\nin the conduct of monetary policy. Traditionally, most of the Fed’s open market\noperations involve the buying and selling of Treasury securities, so broker-dealers that\nare the largest players in this critical market play a significant role in maintaining\nliquidity and market functioning. Most of these firms are also very active in making\nmarkets in a variety of other financial instruments, and as such they help to facilitate\nwell-functioning credit markets more generally.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 1 describes 10 large broker-dealers in 2006, with the fourth column noting\ntheir crisis-era changes. Rather striking changes have occurred among the largest brokerdealers as a result of the financial crisis. Two of the largest became bank holding\ncompanies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns –\nformerly ranking among the ten largest – both failed. Merrill Lynch, which fell just short\nof the top 10 in 2006, was acquired while it was experiencing financial difficulties. And\none of the largest foreign broker-dealers in 2006 (UBS) needed to be supported by its\nhome government. These outcomes occurred despite two substantial emergency lending\nprograms that provided backstop support to the large broker-dealers during the crisis.\nDramatic changes in organization and ownership occurred among these critical\nentities. That, and the extent of their problems during the financial crisis, make it clear\nthat they did not hold sufficient capital to weather the magnitude of problems they would\nface during the crisis.\n\nLiquidity Facilities during the Crisis\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n(PDCF) to help stem the financial crisis by providing overnight loans to primary dealers.\nThe assets that were put up as collateral for the loans were subject to significant\n“haircuts” – that is, the dealers could only borrow against a fraction of assessed market\nvalue – to protect the Fed and minimize the risk that could stem from a borrower’s\ndefault. As with the Fed’s so-called Discount Window lending to commercial banks,\nlending was at the Fed’s primary credit rate and the dealer was fully responsible for the\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrepayment of the loan, beyond the collateral pledged (in other words, the loans were\nmade with recourse).\nThe program began in March 2008, in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure, and\nended in February 2010.4 The PDCF was, in effect, tantamount to the Fed providing a\n“Discount Window” type lending facility to primary dealers – in order to ensure adequate\nfunctioning in securities markets that are a key part of the tri-party repo market.5 These\nmarkets are widely-used in short-term financing, and importantly are used by the central\nbank to conduct the trades in short-term government securities that allow it to maintain\nthe federal funds rate at the level dictated by the FOMC. It is important to point out that\nwhen all was said and done, all the loans made through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility\nwere paid off in full; and the sizable returns to the Fed generated by the program were\nremitted to the U.S. Treasury.\nAs Figure 2 highlights, primary dealers used the program extensively during the\ncrisis. Lending peaked at $156 billion.6 And, while foreign-owned primary dealers did\nparticipate in the program, it was much more extensively utilized by domestic primary\ndealers.\nThe Fed established a second emergency program, the Term Securities Lending\nFacility (TSLF), which allowed primary dealers to lend less-liquid securities to the\nFederal Reserve for one month, for a fee, in exchange for highly liquid Treasury\nsecurities. This program provided needed liquidity to the market at a time when trading\nin a wide variety of securities had become impaired. The TSLF was also announced in\nMarch 2008 and ended in February 2010. As with the PDCF, there were no losses on the\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprogram, and the revenue the Federal Reserve generated in operating the facility was\nreturned to the Treasury.\nFigure 2 also shows that the peak balance of the term securities lending program\nwas $246 billion.7 This program had roughly equal participation by domestic and foreign\nprimary dealers.\nFigure 3 shows the loans outstanding over time with the PDCF. The outstanding\nloans peaked in the fall of 2008 as primary dealers found it particularly difficult to fund\ntheir positions.\nFigure 4 provides the outstanding securities lent through the TSLF. Again the\npeak occurs in the fall of 2008, when liquidity for securities trading became particularly\nproblematic.\nIn sum, broker-dealers experienced dramatic difficulties during the 2008 crisis,\nand the Federal Reserve needed to temporarily backstop broker-dealers with substantial\nlending. Given that recent history, the assumption that collateralized lenders like brokerdealers are not susceptible to runs has been proven wrong.\nAt the same time, broker-dealer capital regulation by the SEC remains largely\nunchanged, despite the lessons of the financial crisis. Consequently, broker-dealers\nremain vulnerable to losing the confidence of funders and counterparties should the world\neconomy again experience a significant financial crisis.\nAs I have mentioned in other speeches,8 during stress periods, bank holding\ncompanies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price\nresponse to the stress periods than institutions with greater concentration in broker-dealer\nactivities. We have also examined the data on credit default swap spreads – a market\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngauge of the cost to insure against a party’s default – and the data show materially higher\nspreads during times of financial turmoil for major banks with higher concentrations of\nbroker-dealer activity.\nMoreover, the current broker-dealer situation vis-à-vis capital poses the potential\nfor significant moral hazard. Were a crisis to once again cause serious problems in\nliquidity and in securities-market functioning, it is quite possible that programs such as\nthe PDCF and TSLF would need to be considered again (notwithstanding likely public\nopposition to what could be perceived as “bailouts”). If broker-dealers assume that they\nwill once again have access to such government support should markets be disrupted,\nthey will have little incentive to take the steps necessary to shield themselves from\nfinancing problems during a crisis and thus minimize their need for a government\nbackstop.\n\nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies\nOne of the fallouts of the financial crisis is that many of the large broker-dealer\noperations are now part of bank holding company structures. Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley became bank holding companies during the crisis. Bear Stearns was\nacquired by J.P. Morgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.\nWhile these large broker-dealer operations are in bank holding companies, there are\nsignificant regulatory requirements and restrictions that apply, including capital\nthresholds and limitations on transactions between the FDIC-insured depository\nsubsidiaries and the affiliated broker-dealer subsidiaries. Despite these restrictions,\nhowever, broker-dealers can still pose a risk to the broader organization by leaning on the\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nparent bank holding company for support and, accordingly, reducing the availability of\nfunds at the parent company to support any FDIC-insured depositary.\nBank holding company capital requirements are applied to the consolidated\nholding company. Arguably, the appropriate level of consolidated capital should depend\non the risks inherent in the holding company’s liability structure, as well as in its assets.\nFor example, to avoid solvency risk for a firm dependent on wholesale funding may\nrequire significantly more capital than a firm with all insured deposits, because of the\npossibility for runs and “fire sale” disposal of assets. Those bank holding companies that\nare primarily funded by insured deposits are unlikely (or less likely) to suffer a\nsubstantial run. However, a bank holding company may find that liabilities of the broker\ndealer may be more susceptible to runs. In addition, current regulations restrict bank\nsubsidiaries from supporting non-depository subsidiaries with funds from the insured\ndepository. This suggests to me that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer\naffiliates should hold more capital to reflect the reduced stability of their liabilities during\ntimes of stress.\nFigure 5 shows the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio over time, and Figure 6\nshows the leverage ratio over time. While bank holding companies with large brokerdealer operations generally have more Tier 1 common equity than bank holding\ncompanies with little or no broker-dealer activity, this result primarily reflects that\nbroker-dealers hold securities, which have low risk-weights compared to loans. In\ncontrast, bank holding companies with large broker-dealer operations tend to have much\nlower leverage ratios than bank holding companies with limited broker-dealer activity.\nHowever, given the very different risks of runs posed by broker-dealers and their less\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nstable liability structure, an argument can be made for higher capital requirements for\nbroker-dealers as well as organizations, such as bank holding companies, with significant\nbroker-dealer operations.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would just reiterate that broker-dealers did not\nperform well during the financial crisis. Many of the largest broker-dealers failed or\nwere converted to or subsumed into bank holding companies. Despite these structural\nchanges, significant government intervention was required to maintain market\nfunctioning and liquidity, in markets key to the stability of the U.S. financial system and\nthe economy that relies on it.\nUnfortunately, despite this history of failure and substantial government support,\nlittle has changed in the solvency requirements of broker-dealers. The status quo\nrepresents an ongoing and significant financial stability risk. In my view, then,\nconsideration should be given to whether broker-dealers should be required to hold\nsignificantly more capital than depository institutions, which have deposit insurance and\npre-ordained access to the central bank’s Discount Window.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nRecently the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted a joint comment letter responding to\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council's proposal on money market mutual fund (MMF) reform,\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/news/press/2013/pr021213-letter.pdf. “Money market mutual funds\nhave no explicit capacity to absorb losses in the event of a decrease in the value of assets held within the\nfund’s portfolio,” said the Reserve Bank presidents in their joint letter. “This structure gives rise to a risk\nof destabilizing money market mutual fund runs by creating a first mover advantage.”\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M.

The Act generally defines a \"broker\" broadly as any person engaged in the\nbusiness of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others. Unlike a broker, who acts as agent,\na dealer acts as principal. The Act generally defines a \"dealer\" as any person engaged in the business of\nbuying and selling securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise. [Source: the SEC’s guide\nto broker-dealer registration, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/bdguide.htm#II]\n3\n\nI would note that Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and New York Fed President William Dudley\nhave raised concerns about broker-dealers and wholesale funding markets. See\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm and\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130201.html. In the former Governor Tarullo\ndiscusses “three proposals currently being debated in policy circles: (1) breaking up large financial\ninstitutions by reinstating Glass-Seagull restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of\ncommercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placing a cap on the non-deposit liabilities of financial\ninstitutions; and (3) requiring financial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of\nlong-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled\nfirm.”\n4\n\nThe final auctions for the PDCF and TSLF were in May and July of 2009, respectively. My graphs end in\nMay and Aug 2009, not Feb 2010, because while the program still existed in those latter months, there were\nno loans outstanding.\n5\n\nMy colleague William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, discussed access to the discount window\nin a speech entitled “Fixing Wholesale Funding to Build a More Stable Financial System,” available at\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130201.html. In it he said “The other path\nwould be to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central\nbank’s lender of last resort function. […] We have banking activity — maturity transformation — taking\nplace today outside commercial banks. If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation\nservices to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the\nsame logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to\nbackstop the banking activity taking place in the markets in a similar way. However, any expansion of\naccess to a lender of last resort would require legislation and it would be essential to have the right quid pro\nquo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight. […] Extension of discount\nwindow-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with\nprudential regulation of these institutions. Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.”\n6\n\nOur PDCF peak ($156 billion) is calculated using daily data and differs from the peak that is calculated\nand often reported using weekly data ($146.6 billion). Similarly our TSLF data is weekly, as of Fridays,\nwhereas it is often published as of Wednesdays.\n7\n\nFigures for the Term Securities Lending Facility reflect expected maturities and may not reflect early\nreturns of loans outstanding.\n8\n\nSee http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/062912/index.htm, particularly the\ndiscussion of broker-dealer financing beginning on page 11, and especially Figure 11.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Conference\nMilan, Italy\nMay 16, 2013\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to participate in the Global Interdependence Center’s\nconference on central banking. This continues to be a period requiring unusual policy actions – even\nexperimentation – at central banks around the world. So it is important to understand the forces\naffecting policymaking as well as the impact of the policies, both domestically and internationally.\nI always begin my talks by noting that these remarks reflect my views, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(the FOMC). That is always the case, but I want to emphasize it today given my topic – the\nimplications of fiscal austerity for monetary policy. This is a matter of great debate in most\ndeveloped economies, as governments contend with relatively high debt burdens – at least by recent\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nhistorical standards – as well as the after-effects of a deep recession, and a painfully slow recovery.\nCertainly fiscal matters are the subject of intense debate in the United States.\nOf course, much of the discussion – and many of the headlines – about fiscal austerity\nemanate from Europe. But, when we total up the cuts in state and local government spending and\nemployment, the cuts in federal government spending and employment, and recent tax policy, we\nactually see that U.S. fiscal policy has been quite contractionary for several years now – beginning\nwell before the recent payroll tax increase and the reductions in fiscal spending mandated by the\nfederal sequester.\nUnlike some of its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank has a dual mandate,\ncovering both inflation and employment. So it is important when pursuing our mandate and shaping\nour policy to consider all the factors that affect the economy. Fiscal policy is one such factor. For\ninstance, contractionary fiscal policy will in the near term place downward pressure on inflation and\nupward pressure on unemployment.\nCurrently the personal consumption expenditures or PCE inflation rate, which the Federal\nReserve chose as the measure for its inflation goal a year ago, is about 1.0 percent. This is well below\nour 2 percent target. And the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent, which while lower than many other\ncountries remains well above most estimates of U.S. “full employment.”\nIt is critically important that the United States achieve a balanced and sustainable framework\nfor government spending, but the timing is important. For example, making cuts too quickly to\nrestore balance to the federal budget deficit will have a dampening effect on near-term growth and the\nrecovery, and as such will push the economy further from a state that achieves both elements of the\nFed’s dual mandate.1\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, fiscal policy is just one of the many factors that the Federal\nReserve considers in policymaking, but one can see how the central bank – pursuing its dual mandate\n– would be likely to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance if government spending\nwere contracting in the midst of an economic recovery. Again, timing is key – long-term budget\nsustainability is vital, but decisions to front-load or back-load cuts in spending, or increases in taxes,\nhave implications for the current stance of monetary policy.\nOf course, some observers and indeed policymakers have criticized the degree of monetary\naccommodation in the United States as excessive. However, when we look at the data on outcomes in\nthe economy to date, I see it differently. The outcomes could lead one to argue that policy has not\nbeen sufficiently accommodative. Inflation is below target and unemployment is above target, and\nbased on the summary of economic projections (or “SEP”) – which is published by the Federal\nReserve and summarizes the economic forecasts of FOMC members – this condition is likely to\npersist for several more years.\nAt least part of this “miss” on inflation and employment outcomes can be attributed to the\nemergence of more fiscal restraint than might have been expected. You may recall that the federal\nsequester was originally designed to pose such an unpalatable outcome that all involved would prefer\nto reach an agreement on a more balanced fiscal approach. Unfortunately, that has not been the result.\nBy definition, the increased fiscal austerity in the U.S. has weakened the outlook for near-term GDP\ngrowth, since government spending is a component of GDP.\nTo be sure, the progress of the economic recovery to date has been frustrating. And, despite\nthe presence of significant headwinds – fiscal, financial, and otherwise – some have suggested that the\nslow recovery proves that recent monetary policy actions have been ineffective. However, contrary to\nwhat these observers claim, I would argue that the “miss” on outcomes is not evidence of monetary\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\npolicy ineffectiveness. In fact, in the sectors of the economy that are likely to be most responsive to\nlower interest rates, like housing and consumer durables, recent growth has been quite rapid.\nContrary to the notion that policy has not succeeded, I would actually say that monetary policy has\nbeen quite effective in offsetting the contractionary effects of recent fiscal policies.\n\nFiscal Policy and the Recovery\nAs everyone here probably knows, the overall growth rate of real U.S. GDP during this\nrecovery has been quite slow – averaging roughly 2 percent at an annual rate. Growth has also been\nslow relative to the growth that occurred during the most recent economic recoveries in the U.S.\nHowever, looking at overall GDP growth is only part of the story. Looking more closely at the\ncomponents of real GDP reveals differences, and provides more perspective on the U.S. economy’s\ntepid recovery.\nFigure 1 shows growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers. Essentially this is\njust the consumption and investment components of GDP (household and firm spending), net of\ninventory accumulation. It tries to capture the growth in domestic spending not attributed to\ngovernment spending or to the foreign sector.\nOver the past three years, real final sales to private domestic purchasers have been quite\nstrong, reflecting particular strength in consumer durables and residential investment2 – the most\ninterest-sensitive sectors. With household and firm spending relatively strong, other sectors of the\neconomy must account for the slow growth in overall GDP.\nFigure 2 adds real final sales to all domestic purchasers to Figure 1, so the difference between\nthe two lines is attributable to government spending. This measure has only been growing at a rate a\nlittle below 2 percent over the past three years. In short, while household and firm spending has been\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nrelatively robust, it has been offset by a fiscal headwind – reduced government spending – netting out\nto only tepid overall growth.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in government spending. Clearly, over the past three years the\ngrowth rate has been mostly negative, so real government spending has brought down the GDP total.\nThis is in contrast to the earlier period, during the recession, when government spending was actually\nan offset to the weakness in the private sector. During that period there was federal stimulus money,\nand federal funding for state and local governments designed to help them better “weather the storm.”\nFigure 4 shows another way to measure the impact of government spending on economic\ngrowth – the percent contribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP.\nRecently, the increase in real GDP includes a sizable negative contribution from reductions in\ngovernment spending.\nFigure 5 splits government spending into the federal component, and the state and local\ncomponent. State and local spending has been weak over the entire recovery, although as the\neconomy has recovered and state and local governments have seen more tax revenue, it has become\nmuch less of a headwind than earlier in the recovery. On the other hand, federal spending has\nrecently fallen sharply and is likely to continue to be a source of weakness in the GDP accounts, given\nthe federal sequester.\nHistorically speaking, this pattern is unusual during economic recoveries. Figure 6 indexes\ngovernment spending at the trough of the recession to 100 for the current and previous three\nrecoveries. This recovery has been unusual in that government spending is not normally a significant\nsource of headwind as the economy recovers – in fact usually the opposite is true.\nConsider the 1982 recovery – the last time we had a recession where the unemployment rate\nreached 10 percent. Government spending by this stage of the recovery had increased by 20 percent,\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\none reason that particular recovery was strong. By contrast, during this recovery real government\nspending has declined by more than 5 percent over the 15 quarters of the recovery.\nFigure 7 shows total payroll employment and private payroll employment. The difference\nbetween the two reflects changes in government employment. During the recession, total payroll\nemployment was less negative than private payroll employment, indicating the government sector was\nnot shedding jobs at a time when the private sector was significantly downsizing. However, during\nthe recovery period, private sector payroll employment has grown more rapidly than the total,\nreflecting the loss of government jobs that has persisted over the recovery.\nIn sum, fiscal restraint during the recovery has been notable and naturally has factored into the\nrecovery’s pace. While the sectors that are sensitive to monetary policy have responded to the Fed’s\naccommodative policy actions, the results have not fully offset the headwinds, fiscal and otherwise,\nthat we have seen. The overall result has been economic growth around 2 percent, and only a very\ngradual improvement in labor markets.\n\nFiscal Restraint and Inflation\nThe unemployment rate is about 7.5 percent – at least 2 percentage points above my estimate\nof the U.S. “full employment” rate. Add to this the recent U.S. inflation experience and the other\nfactors I have been discussing, and it seems to me that highly accommodative monetary policy is\ncurrently appropriate.\nDespite concerns expressed by some that increases in the Federal Reserve balance sheet may\nbe inflationary in the near term, the inflation rate remains well below target nearly five years after our\nbalance sheet expanded significantly. Make no mistake, in many situations such balance sheet\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nactivity would be inflationary, but the fact that it has not been underlines how challenging the recent\nfinancial crisis, recession, and slow recovery have been.\nFigure 8 provides total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation has remained below 2\npercent since December 2008 and currently is only 1.1 percent, close to the low for the last five years.\nTotal PCE inflation is slightly below 1 percent, at 0.97 percent.\nIndeed, the level to which the inflation rate has fallen would actually be of some concern in\nthe event that the economy was hit by a negative shock. Such a situation might echo the historical\nexperience of Japan, where low rates of inflation were not addressed and a significant negative shock\ncaused Japan to experience deflation, which has been quite difficult to reverse. In the U.S. there is no\nevidence that inflation expectations have fallen, despite the actual experience of persistently\nundershooting the Fed’s 2 percent target. However, remaining at such a low rate of inflation rate does\nincrease the risk that a negative shock could alter the stable inflation expectations that we have\nexperienced.\nFigure 9 shows one reason why this is a concern. It plots the real interest rate as the difference\nbetween the 3-month Treasury rate and the year-over-year core PCE inflation rate. In effect, this\nassumes that inflation expectations equal the past year’s core PCE inflation rate. Since the 3-month\nTreasury rate has remained very close to zero for more than four years, the movements in the real rate\nmust primarily reflect changes in the other part of the equation – the inflation rate. Importantly, as the\ninflation rate falls, the real interest rate rises. Higher real interest rates make it more expensive to\nborrow, after controlling for changes in inflation. Japan has been an extreme example of this\ndynamic, given that deflation has caused the real interest rate to remain positive despite a weak\neconomy and falling prices.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nIn sum, the longer we in the U.S. remain so far below our 2 percent target, the greater the risk\nthat inflation expectations could fall and real interest rates rise. In part to offset this risk, the Fed has\nconducted large-scale asset purchases that increase its balance sheet.\n\nBalance Sheet Implications\nFigure 10 shows central bank assets in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Euro area.\nEach central bank has expanded its balance sheet, with the U.K. and the U.S. being particularly active.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has seen a renewed increase in the size of its balance sheet, starting\nin the fall of last year, reflecting the new program of open-ended asset purchases. This latest program\nhas helped keep prevailing interest rates low, so that housing and consumer durables can continue to\nsupport the expansion and so we make further progress on both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate\n(inflation and employment).\nWe have seen a gradual improvement in labor markets, in part as a result of these actions. The\nunemployment rate was 7.8 percent in September when we began the program, and is currently 7.5\npercent. Employment growth averaged about 150,000 jobs per month in the three months ending in\nSeptember; then for the most recent three months (February through April) employment growth\naveraged over 200,000 jobs per month. But despite modest increases in employment in recent\nmonths, the employment-to-population ratio remains low.\nThis last observation carries the more ominous implication that, while there has been\nimprovement in labor markets, much of the improvement in the unemployment rate is just a result of\nworkers leaving the labor force. More significant improvement in the employment picture will\nrequire growth in real GDP that is faster than the 2 percent we have been averaging.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nAs I noted earlier, restrictive fiscal policy has had an impact on near-term economic growth\nduring the recovery. As Figure 11 shows, cuts in real government spending in the United States over\nthe past three years have been quite large. In fact, the cuts in government spending in the United\nStates have been much larger in percentage terms than in the U.K. or the Euro area, where fiscal\nausterity has received more attention. Fiscal restraint is one of the headwinds that we factored into\nmonetary policymaking, framed of course by our mandates from Congress.\nWhile Figure 11 considers only government spending, Figure 12 presents a broader measure\nof fiscal austerity, by including the revenue side and adjusting for the business cycle. The chart\nshows the impact of changes in taxes as well as government spending, after controlling for economic\ngrowth (removing the impact of the business cycle). Looking at the change in the general\ngovernment structural budget balance3 relative to potential GDP over the period 2010 to 2013, the\ndegree of fiscal austerity is fairly similar across the U.S., U.K., and Euro area.\nGiven the additional restraint imposed by the federal sequester, the United States is likely to\nonce again be a leader in cutting government spending. The Federal Reserve should, and will,\ncontinue to consider the likely state of fiscal policy, like many other economic factors, in making\nmonetary policy.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve. Labor markets have also slowly\nimproved. The progress has been in part the result of the accommodative monetary policy. While\nhousehold and firm spending has grown relatively rapidly, it has been partially offset by headwinds\nincluding cuts in government spending – resulting in only modest overall economic growth.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nLet me close by reiterating that a long-term sustainable solution for fiscal balance is absolutely\nin the country’s interest. But timing is an issue. We have suffered a severe financial crisis, a deep\nrecession, and a painfully slow recovery. Fiscal policy is obviously the jurisdiction of the legislative\nand executive branches of government, but given the economic realities I would urge policymakers to\nconsider scenarios where some elements of fiscal rebalancing take effect only after the economy has\nmore fully improved, and the possibility of a less restrictive fiscal stance until that time.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSome would observe that much of the current federal budget deficit is cyclical, not structural – that simply moving to full\nemployment would eliminate a significant share of the budget deficit.\n2\n\nResidential investment has grown strongly over the last six quarters; prior to that its performance was more mixed.\n\n3\n\nThe structural budget balance refers to the general government cyclically adjusted balance adjusted for nonstructural\nelements beyond the economic cycle. These include temporary financial sector and asset price movements as well as oneoff, or temporary, revenue or expenditure items. The cyclically adjusted balance is the fiscal balance adjusted for the\neffects of the economic cycle; see, for example, A. Fedelino. A. Ivanova and M. Horton “Computing Cyclically Adjusted\nBalances and Automatic Stabilizers” IMF Technical Guidance Note No. 5,\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/tnm/2009/tnm0905.pdf.\n\n11\n\n\f",

When I was in graduate school at\nthe University of Wisconsin at Madison, my brother was in graduate school at the\nUniversity of Minnesota – so I have fond memories of visiting the Guthrie Theater,\nenjoying the lakes, and seeing the passionate way a warm day is welcomed in this city.\nI am also grateful that you were looking for a speaker in May, and not January.\nMy comments today will focus on the progress the economy has made since the\nFederal Reserve adopted an open-ended large-scale asset purchase program last\nSeptember. I should mention as I always do that my comments reflect my views, not\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Fed’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nAt last September’s meeting of the FOMC, we took into account the August\nunemployment rate of 8.1 percent, and weighed concerns that without more policy\naccommodation the economy would make little progress in returning to full employment\nin the near term.\nSince adopting an asset purchase program focused on mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) last September, 1 and additional longer-term Treasury securities in December, 2\nthere has been some evidence of strengthening labor markets. The unemployment rate is\ncurrently 7.5 percent, and payroll employment growth has averaged more than 200,000\njobs per month over the past several months.\n\nI expect that the unemployment rate will\n\nbe down to 7.25 percent or a bit lower by the end of the year. This has been my forecast\nsince the beginning of the year, but the recent incoming data have bolstered my\nconfidence in that degree of improvement being achieved. In fact, I see it as a quite\npositive sign of underlying economic strength that labor markets are improving despite\nsignificant fiscal “headwinds” in the form of the payroll tax increase and the federal\nbudget sequester.\nWhat are the implications of these incremental changes in the economy for the\nFederal Reserve’s asset-purchase program? The program was designed to continue until\nthere was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, as long as the\nbenefits of the purchases outweighed the costs. My personal view is that the benefits of\nthis accommodative monetary policy program still significantly outweigh the costs.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile some improvement in labor markets has been achieved, it does not yet constitute\nprogress sufficient to merit halting the asset purchase program.\nAs for the costs, the Fed is and should be very attuned to unintended\nconsequences – and is intently monitoring an array of asset prices, including stock prices,\nhousing prices, and other widely held assets. At this point it seems that fundamentals are\nprevailing, and potential costs are well contained.\nI also believe that the Federal Reserve should make adjustments to the program\nbased on economic outcomes – that if the economy and the outlook improve, the rate of\npurchases could be gradually reduced, rather than suddenly stopped once we have\nachieved substantial improvement in labor markets. By the way, a reduction is one\npossibility, but of course adjustments could be down or up – because if the incoming\neconomic data do not reflect improvements consistent with both elements of our dual\nmandate, I believe the Fed should be willing to increase asset purchases.\n\nProgress in the Economic Outlook\nFigure 1 shows how the Blue-Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end\nof 2013, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters 3 projection for the same, have\nevolved since last September. As the actual, current unemployment rate has slowly\nreceded, there has been a gradual improvement in the forecast for the unemployment rate\nat the end of this year. Both forecasts are now projecting the unemployment rate will be\nlower at the end of the year than they had projected last September, although they are still\nnot quite as optimistic as my own forecast.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTurning to inflation measures, Figure 2 shows the evolution since last September\nof the Blue Chip forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) at the end of 2013, and the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters projection for the Personal Consumption Expenditures\n(PCE) inflation rate at the end of 2013. Both show declining forecasts of inflation for\n2013, as incoming data consistently come in below forecasts – raising the possibility that\ninflation will fall further below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 4 We have\nbeen purchasing $85 billion in securities per month. Were we to decide to lower the\npurchase amount somewhat, our assets would continue to rise but at a more modest rate.\nThus we would be increasing monetary accommodation, but at a slower pace.\nOf course, many asset prices are calibrated to the anticipation of our cumulative\npurchases. Thus the effect of our purchases ultimately depends on whether they result in\na larger or smaller balance sheet for the central bank, which in turn depends on when the\npurchase program ends, given the pace of purchases. If asset purchases at a lower rate\nwere to continue for longer than they would otherwise, the Fed’s balance sheet could\nactually grow larger than it would with more sizable purchases over a shorter period. So,\nin short, altering the flow of purchases may or may not result in a smaller central bank\nbalance sheet, depending on how long the reduced inflow of assets continued.\nFigure 4 provides a scatter diagram that attempts to depict the economy’s\nexperience with inflation and unemployment, the two facets of the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate from Congress. Of course a variety of factors play a role in these outcomes, not\njust monetary policy – but it is instructive to look at the actual recent experience.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOn the horizontal or x axis I have plotted the PCE inflation rate minus 2 percent –\nso when the inflation rate is at our target, 2 percent, the dot should lie on the vertical or y\naxis. If inflation is above 2 percent it will be to the right of the vertical axis and if\ninflation rate is undershooting our target it will be to the left of the vertical axis. By the\nway, while the FOMC has only had an explicit 2 percent inflation target for the past 16\nmonths, there is strong empirical evidence suggesting that the central bank had an\nimplicit 2 percent inflation target over the past two decades. 5\nThe chart’s vertical or y axis focuses on the employment side of our mandate. It\nplots the deviation of the unemployment rate from the Congressional Budget Office’s\n(CBO’s) estimate of full employment. When the unemployment rate is above the full\nemployment level, the observations are above the horizontal or x-axis, and when the\nunemployment rate is below the full employment level the observations are below the\nhorizontal axis.\nIn short, a hypothetical “bull’s eye” outcome reflecting the dual mandate\nframework could show up as an inflation rate of 2 percent and an unemployment rate at\nthe CBO’s estimate of full employment – and such an observation would lie at the\nintersection of the two axes. Points that are near the intersection of the axes could be\nconsidered close to achieving both elements of the mandate.\nThe three red diamonds represent the most recent three quarters. They appear in\nthe upper left quadrant, where unemployment is well above the full employment level\nand inflation is below target. The red diamonds are well above the cluster of\nobservations representing quarters where performance was closer to mandate (closer to\nthe origin where the axes cross) – but at the same time are much closer to the origin than\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nat earlier stages of the recovery, when we experienced much higher unemployment rates\nthan we see currently.\nFigure 5 provides the same information as Figure 4, but uses the core PCE\nmeasure of inflation rather than the total PCE. With the core measure, the more volatile\nfood and energy prices that the Federal Reserve cares about but cannot control are\nexcluded. Clearly this measure of the inflation rate does not show as wide a range of\nobservations, in particular because it does not encompass the significant swings in oil\nprices that we have seen over the past two decades.\nThe chart clearly shows a dense set of observations near the origin and a\nsomewhat less dense set of observations above the three red diamonds. The chart implies\nthat we are transitioning from being well away from full employment, and have been\nmoving closer to the horizontal axis as the economy has recovered.\nFigure 6 shows total PCE inflation over a longer time period, the past three\ndecades. The solid horizontal line reflects the most recent observation of total PCE\ninflation. While there are three periods when total PCE inflation has been lower over the\npast 30 years, the current PCE inflation rate is much lower than it has been over most of\nthat period.\nFigure 7 shows the core PCE inflation over the past three decades, again with the\nmost recent observation reflected in a dark horizontal line. This shows even more starkly\njust how low the inflation rate is currently. The current core PCE inflation rate is close to\nthe low point for the past 30 years.\nSwitching from inflation to unemployment, Figure 8 shows the unemployment\nrate over the past three decades with a dark horizontal line at 7.5 percent unemployment,\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe current unemployment rate. While the unemployment rate has fallen significantly\nfrom its peak during this business cycle, it is still quite high. At an unemployment rate of\n7.5 percent, the rate is above the peak level in the last prior recession (2001) and near the\npeak level associated with the 1990 recession.\nThe charts highlight that while we have seen some improvement in labor markets,\nthe unemployment rate remains well above what can be considered full employment, and\nthe inflation rate remains well below target. In fact, core inflation remains at the very\nlow end of recent experience, and the unemployment rate is close to the cyclical peaks of\nthe past two recessions. And as I mentioned before, potential unintended costs of the\naccommodative policy are not currently evident. Taken together, these facts provide the\nrationale for my own view that, while we have seen some improvement in labor market\nconditions, significant accommodation remains appropriate at this time.\n\nDisaggregated Labor Market Data\nFigure 9 shows the pattern of unemployment by state – with dark green\nrepresenting states that have had a decline in the unemployment rate of 1.0 percent or\nmore since last September, light green representing states that have had a decline between\n0.5 and 1.0 percent, yellow representing states that have had a decline ranging from 0.0 to\n0.5 percent, and red representing states that have had an increase in the unemployment\nrate.\nThe overall improvement in unemployment rates has been widespread. Only five\nstates had higher unemployment rates in April 2013 than in September 2012, and one of\nthem is North Dakota – a state that has a very low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSome of the states with the biggest declines in the unemployment rate have been among\nthose with very high rates, such as Nevada, Rhode Island, California, and Florida. Also\nnotable is the fact that states that were particularly troubled by falling real estate values\nand elevated foreclosure – such as California, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the\nstates with the largest declines in the unemployment rate.\nIt is also instructive to examine not just unemployment rates but the state patterns\nin payroll employment growth – since in some states the unemployment rate fell in part\nbecause of declines in the labor force, which could be the result of discouraged workers\ngiving up the search for a formal job. Figure 10 shows payroll employment growth by\nstate. Dark green states have had positive payroll employment growth that expanded\nfaster than the labor force. Light green states have had increases in payroll employment\nbut no increase in the labor force. Yellow states have had positive payroll employment\ngrowth, but the expansion has been slower than growth in the labor force. And the red\nstates have had declines in payroll employment.\nIt is encouraging that only three states have experienced declines in payroll\nemployment. Also, those states that were hit hardest by declines in real estate values –\nCalifornia, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the states that have experienced growth\nin payroll employment that exceeds growth in the labor force.\nTaken together, Figures 9 and 10 indicate that improvements in labor markets\nhave been relatively widespread, and that regions that were particularly impacted by real\nestate problems are among the states that have recovered the most since last September.\nOverall, this indicates that the economic recovery is beginning to positively impact most\nregions of the country.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, since last September there has been continued slow\nimprovement in labor markets. Most regions of the country now have better labor market\nconditions than they did last September. Despite the slowly improving labor market\noutlook, the unemployment rate remains at levels close to the peaks of the past two\nrecessions, indicating that the economy remains far from the full employment level.\nIn terms of monetary policy, it would in my view be premature to stop the Fed’s\nlarge-scale asset purchase program at this time. I believe the Fed should continue the\npurchase program until we see more sustained improvement in labor markets and have\ngreater confidence that the economic recovery is sufficiently self-sustaining to yield\ncontinued progress in reducing the still very high unemployment rate.\nHowever, I would also say that it may be undesirable to abruptly stop purchases,\nso it may make sense to consider a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases if we\nsee a few months more of gradual improvement in labor markets and improvement in the\noverall growth rate in the economy – consistent, by the way, with my forecast, which is\nsomewhat more optimistic than that of many private forecasters.\nI would reiterate that with an open-ended asset purchase program, changing the\nflow of purchases does not necessarily yield, in the end, a smaller central bank balance\nsheet. That would depend on having a fixed point for cessation of purchases, combined\nwith a lower flow of purchases. So, even if we were to adjust the rate of monthly\npurchases, the ultimate size of the Fed’s balance sheet would depend on the point of\ncessation. If economic growth proves sufficient and the purchase program was not\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nextended over a longer time period, the size of the balance sheet could be smaller than\notherwise.\nThe bottom line is that we really need to see the economy grow, as I hope and\nexpect, more quickly than at the 2.1 percent growth rate it has averaged over the\nrecovery. Faster growth is essential to attaining inflation and employment outcomes\nconsistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – and more broadly\nfor the economic wellbeing of the many Americans who have struggled through a long\nand slow recovery.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee the September 13, 2012 FOMC statement available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\n\n2\n\nAfter our program to extend the average maturity of our holdings of Treasury securities was completed at\nthe end of 2012.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n“Money Market Mutual Funds\nand Stable Funding”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConference on Stable Funding\nsponsored by\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nand the\nOffice of Financial Research\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 27, 2013\n\nI would like to thank the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Office of\nFinancial Research for organizing this conference, and for inviting me to speak today. As\nyou all know, we recently passed the five-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman\nBrothers. This conference is particularly appropriate because many of the issues\nsurrounding stable funding, so relevant in the crisis, sadly remain with us today.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIndeed, one of the hallmarks of the 2008 financial crisis was the severity of runs\non financial intermediaries that were not traditional depository institutions. During these\nruns, the inability to obtain short-term funding meant that broker-dealers could not\nfinance their securities portfolios. Similarly, Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and\nother structured financial entities could not obtain rollover financing. And as you well\nknow, in the wake of the Lehman failure, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to\nmaintain a fixed net asset value (NAV). Investors who were concerned that other funds\nwith exposure to Lehman might not be able to maintain their NAVs ran from prime\nmoney market mutual funds (MMMFs).\nMany of the structural weaknesses that lie beneath these run episodes have yet to\nbe fully addressed by market participants and policymakers. It is good that they will be\ndiscussed in various sessions at today’s conference.\nGiven that our time is limited, I will focus my remarks on MMMFs and, given the\nconference themes, the critical role that MMMFs play in short-term credit markets,\nproviding funding to financial intermediaries. I will first describe how prime MMMFs\ncontributed critically to the financial instability experienced in the fall of 2008 –\ninstability that necessitated substantial government intervention, including providing\ninsurance for MMMFs, tailoring an emergency lending facility to provide liquidity for\nMMMFs, and providing a variety of other emergency liquidity facilities – in part as a\nresult of the “collateral damage” throughout the financial infrastructure stemming from\nthe run on MMMFs. I would stress that these actions were taken not to prop up the\nfinancial infrastructure per se, but rather to ensure funding flows that are crucial to real\neconomic activity.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSecond, I will describe some of the challenges posed by the structure of MMMFs,\nwhich necessitated the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) 2010 reforms to\nRule 2-a7 as well as the Commission’s current proposal on money market mutual fund\nreform. In this, I will draw heavily from the joint letter sent by all 12 of the Federal\nReserve Bank presidents in response to the SEC’s request for comment. I would like,\nhowever, to stress that while many of my comments will draw from that comment letter,\nmy remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues\nat the Board of Governors, or the other Reserve Bank presidents who signed the letter.1\nThird, I will discuss what I see as some needed enhancements to the SEC\nproposal. I will conclude that the floating NAV proposal, properly implemented, would\nenhance financial stability; but the proposal to allow discretionary liquidity fees and\nredemption gates would not enhance financial stability – and would likely be worse than\nthe status quo.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Funds during the Crisis\nFigure 1 shows total MMMF assets under management, which currently total\napproximately $2.6 trillion. These assets are distributed across funds that buy short-term,\ntax-free municipal securities (approximately $265 billion in assets), funds that buy shortterm government and agency securities2 (approximately $890 billion in assets), and funds\nthat purchase short-term corporate and financial debt instruments as well as government\nand agency securities. The latter, the so-called “prime” money market mutual funds,\nrepresent about 56 percent of total MMMF assets (about $1.5 trillion).3\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAll three types of MMMFs hold short-term securities, as required by rule 2a-7\nunder the Investment Company Act. Specifically, the Act constrains MMMFs to hold\nsecurities with no more than 397 days to maturity and to maintain a weighted average\nmaturity of 60 days or less.4 The MMMFs, regulated by the SEC, are to have very\nlimited interest rate risk, a high degree of liquidity, and – ideally – relatively limited\ncredit risk.\nFigure 2 shows the assets under management for all MMMFs, and separately for\njust the prime money market funds. As you can see, MMMFs grew rapidly during the\nperiod leading up to the financial crisis, but experienced a significant outflow when the\nfailure of Lehman Brothers led the Reserve Primary Fund to “break the buck” (becoming\nunable to maintain a fixed $1 per share net asset value).\nAs it became apparent that some prime funds were exposed to non-trivial amounts\nof credit risk, and with investors in the Reserve Primary Fund unable to access their\nmoney and facing uncertain losses, investors in other prime MMMFs began to quickly\nredeem their funds. In the week after the Reserve Primary Fund announcement, more\nthan $300 billion dollars “ran” from prime funds. At least some of the funds redeemed\nfrom prime MMMFs were reinvested into government MMMFs, as investors sought\nfunds that did not take credit risk. Of course, others transferred deposits to insured\ndepository institutions.\nThe run on prime MMMFs would likely have been much more severe and\ndisruptive had the Treasury not announced a temporary guarantee program, which\nprovided insurance to money fund investors, and had the Federal Reserve not set up an\nemergency lending facility that provided needed liquidity to MMMFs experiencing (or\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nconcerned that they might soon experience) significant withdrawals.5 These\nunprecedented government actions were designed to provide confidence to investors to\nstem the outflows from prime funds. But they were also intended to stabilize the shortterm funding markets, because the dramatic reduction in money fund assets meant that\nmoney market funds withdrew from their role as significant purchasers of short-term debt\ninstruments – an activity critical to the functioning of short-term credit markets and the\nprovision of stable funding within the financial system.\nFigure 3, which shows the current composition of prime money market mutual\nfunds, highlights why these entities are so critical to the provision of stable funding.\nMMMFs continue to provide important liquidity for short-term debt instruments, such as\ncommercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and short-term debt obligations. As I\nhave suggested, one reason that short-term credit froze up in the wake of Lehman’s\nfailure was that money market funds were not able to continue purchasing such debt,\nwhich slowed the flow of critical stable funding within the “financial ecosystem.”\nThe result was that the Federal Reserve needed to provide liquidity not only to\nMMMFs directly, but also to markets where MMMFs were usually an important source\nof financing.6 By the way, it is worth noting that both the temporary guarantees provided\nby the Treasury and the type of liquidity facility run by the Federal Reserve are now\nessentially ruled out (by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and by Dodd-Frank\nprovisions). Thus, if MMMFs were to again experience a significant run, short-term\ncredit markets could not rely on the same degree of government support, and might find\nthe shock to stable funding to be even more disruptive.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSo where are we now? Currently we have new limitations on public-sector safety\nnets for MMMFs. We have the still-remaining risk of a significant disruption to shortterm credit markets, were MMMFs to again experience runs. As a result, there are\nreasons to remain concerned about credit risk some MMMFs may be taking.\nOne possible source of risk is highlighted in Figure 4, which shows the European\nexposure of MMMFs. Roughly one-third of the assets held by prime MMMFs are related\nto European firms. Of course, there are many European firms with low credit risk, but if\nsome MMMFs get more comfortable with riskier European exposures, the financial\nsystem becomes more susceptible to a financial shock emanating from Europe.\nFigure 5 shows the reduction in MMMFs’ exposure to commercial paper and\nasset-backed commercial paper since the financial crisis. The decline, in part, reflects the\nlow-interest-rate environment, which has led many firms to issue longer-term debt. It\nalso reflects the fact that many markets that relied on asset-backed financing still have not\nrecovered. However, money markets remain an important source of financing for these\ninstruments.\nIn summary, I would say that prime MMMFs remain a very important source of\nfinancing for short-term debt instruments – and thus any disruption in the MMMF sector\ncould again impede the provision of stable funding to financial intermediaries. Many of\nthe tools used to offset the 2008 run by MMMF investors have been ruled out by\nlegislation. And once again, some MMMFs are beginning to take riskier positions. Thus,\nthe financial stability concerns surrounding MMMFs remain real, five years after the\nfinancial crisis.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Reform\nReform remains critical because MMMFs implicitly promise to return a fixed net\nasset value, even as they take credit risks against which they hold no capital. A failure to\nkeep this implicit promise during a future period of financial turmoil could risk once\nagain freezing short-term credit markets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council\n(FSOC) has proposed three potential reforms,7 with the one requiring MMMFs to hold\ncapital quite similar to proposals currently being considered in Europe.8 However, at this\ntime the SEC has advanced only two proposals, only one of which was included in the\nFSOC proposals.\nThe first SEC proposal, which was suggested by the FSOC, would treat\ninstitutional prime MMMFs like other mutual funds and allow the value of a share of the\nfund to float with the value of its underlying assets. But unlike the FSOC’s proposal, the\nSEC’s proposal limits this reform option to institutional prime MMMFs (funds serving\ninstitutional investors).\nThe incentive to run on a MMMF stems from the concern that a fund could suffer\ncredit or other losses and would be unable to redeem shares at its “fixed” net asset value.\nIn that case, the first investors to ask for their funds back will get them, while later\ninvestors may not.\nThe floating NAV, which removes the implicit promise to redeem shares at a\nfixed net asset value, short-circuits this dynamic. Investors recognize that the market\nvalue of the fund’s assets can fluctuate modestly, even though they are of high quality\nand short maturity. As a consequence, the value of their shares in the fund will fluctuate\n– as they do with most other mutual funds – and what they receive upon redemption will\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\ndepend on the market prices of the fund’s assets at the time of redemption. Thus, with a\nfloating NAV, if the assets properly reflect market values, the incentive to run that stems\nfrom the possibility of “breaking the buck” under the current rules should be significantly\nreduced.\nThe second SEC proposal, which was not suggested by the FSOC, would require\nthe fund’s directors to impose a fee of not more than 2 percent on all redemptions in the\nevent that the fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below a specified threshold. The proposal,\nhowever, gives the fund’s directors discretion to impose a lower fee or no fee if they\ndetermine that such action is not in the best interest of the fund.9 This liquidity fee is\nintended to discourage investors from redeeming funds at a time when the MMMF is\nexperiencing significant withdrawals. Additionally, under the proposal the fund’s\ndirectors could, at their discretion, impose temporary “gates” to prevent redemptions for a\ntime. These temporary redemption gates would, the proposal envisions, prevent investors\nfrom redeeming funds – thus ending an investor run.\nAllow me to address the two proposals in reverse order. The reason for my strong\nopposition to the second proposal is that liquidity fees and gates fundamentally change\nthe investor’s decision-making process during a financial crisis in a way that increases\nthe potential for financial instability, and could be worse than no reform at all. The\nliquidity fee imposes a haircut on investors who are redeeming funds – a haircut that may\nnot be associated with the underlying value of the assets. Since MMMFs are often used\nas transaction accounts, this haircut would impose significant fees on investors that had\nviewed the account as a means of paying for transactions (and most MMMFs are\ncurrently paying less than 5 basis points a year to investors).\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn addition, the temporary redemption gates would restrict investors’ access to\ntheir funds. During a crisis, investors may find that they temporarily have no access to\ntheir funds – and financial crises are exactly the time that many investors most need\naccess to their liquid funds. And when some entities do not have access (or fear that their\ncounterparty will not have access), it can have domino effects throughout the financial\nsystem.\nIn short, liquidity fees and redemption gates fundamentally change the MMMF\nproduct during a crisis. As discussed above, these alterations would likely increase the\nincentive to run from a MMMF. But in addition, they increase the risk of “contagious”\nruns. Assume, for example, that a fund has no credit risk problems, but another fund in\nthe midst of a crisis announces that it is imposing fees and gates. Now the investor must\nconsider how other co-investors in the same fund will behave: If other investors run, the\ninvestor could be faced with gates and fees even though the underlying assets have\nexperienced no change in value.\nThe probability of a run is increased due to the high degree of concentration at\nmany prime funds. Of the five largest institutional prime MMMFs as of the end of June\n2013, three had at least two shareholders each with a 5 percent or greater stake in the\nfund. If redemptions by one or more of these large shareholders caused a fund to breach\nthe weekly liquid assets threshold, other investors in the fund might run for fear that a fee\nor gate may be forthcoming.\nUnder this proposal, prime MMMFs would still take credit risk, promise a fixed\nnet asset value, and hold no capital. What would change is that the MMMF itself could\nfundamentally change during a crisis, by possibly imposing redemption gates and\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nliquidity fees. So this proposed alternative might actually increase run risk, and pose\ngreater financial stability concerns than the status quo.10\nThe other SEC proposal treats prime institutional MMMFs like all other mutual\nfunds. As with other funds, investors redeem funds at the net value of the underlying\nassets at the time of redemption. With this reform, MMMFs would be very similar to\nshort-term bond mutual funds, but have more restrictions on liquidity and credit risk than\nthe typical short-term bond mutual fund.\nSome might worry about continuing to use MMMFs for their current purposes\n(institutional transactions accounts, short-term savings) with a floating NAV. But the\nactual movement in the values of the underlying assets during most periods is likely to be\nquite modest.\nI would note that a potential problem with this proposal is that the fund must\ndetermine appropriate values for money market instruments that often see little\nsecondary market trading. In practice, funds would continue to employ a variety of\nmodels and “matrix pricing” techniques to value their assets, and could also hold certain\nsecurities at amortized cost so long as the result reflects the securities’ fair value. Any\nmodel problems – or any inappropriate application of amortized cost accounting – would\ndegrade the effectiveness of this proposal. My preferred response would be for the SEC\nto continue its efforts to increase the transparency of fixed income markets, to further\nenhance price discovery, and to periodically examine MMMF assets – especially those\nexperiencing significant credit risk deterioration – to confirm that funds’ valuation\nprocesses are appropriate.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn short, in my view moving to a floating NAV and treating MMMFs like all\nother mutual funds – if valuation is appropriately addressed – would reduce the financial\nstability concerns around MMMFs.\n\nAdditional Considerations\nThe SEC proposal on a floating NAV only applies to institutional prime funds.\nThis raises two concerns. First, Figure 6 shows the support that MMMFs received during\nthe 2007 to 2010 period, by fund type. More than 30 of the retail prime money market\nfunds needed support during the crisis, only somewhat less than the number of non-retail\nprime funds that needed support.11\nAlso, more than 40 retail funds took advantage of the emergency liquidity facility\nadministered for the Federal Reserve System by the Boston Reserve Bank to support\nliquidity for MMMFs. So, while institutional prime funds experienced significant\ninvestor runs, in the absence of extensive support and a liquidity facility provided by the\nFederal Reserve, retail funds may have experienced more significant investor runs as\nwell.\nA second concern is that the retail exemption applies to funds with a daily\nshareholder redemption limit of $1 million or less. An institutional investor may choose\nto spread funds across retail MMMFs so as to get the fixed NAV while still maintaining\nthe ability to quickly redeem. This would not only thwart the intent of the exemption, but\nalso result in retail funds being much more susceptible to runs in the next crisis.\nWhile the severe runs occurred at institutional prime funds during the last\nfinancial crisis, there is no assurance that the next crisis will avoid retail funds. With no\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\ngovernment support and with some institutional investors in retail funds, retail funds may\nbe much more prone to runs than the SEC proposal presumes.\nAnother concern is that government funds are exempt from the floating NAV\nrequirement as long as at least 80 percent of their total assets are in cash or governmentrelated securities. As Figure 7 shows, the largest government funds hold nearly 100\npercent of their asset in cash or government-related securities.12 Government funds\nshould be government funds. Using an 80 percent threshold allows funds to create a\nprime/government fund hybrid that would receive fixed NAV treatment. In my view, it\nshould be clear that investors are investing in government funds, and I would recommend\nsetting a much higher threshold – consistent with current practices at many of the largest\nfunds.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would stress that MMMF reform is overdue.\nHowever, it is important that the reforms actually reduce the financial stability issues that\nremain under the current structure. Promising a fixed NAV with no capital while taking\ncredit risk is not sustainable – especially in potential future crises where the response of\nthe public sector will be substantially limited, compared to 2008. MMMF runs should\nnot be allowed to once again impede the flow of stable funding within our financial\nsystem.\nThe SEC proposal to allow funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates\nshould be dropped. This particular proposal is, in my view, worse than the status quo. It\nwould only increase the risk of financial instability.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nHowever, I strongly support requiring a floating NAV for all prime funds, both\ninstitutional and retail, which would treat these funds like other mutual funds. Investors\nwho want a fixed NAV can keep their funds in government-only funds – and those\nshould have the vast majority of their portfolios invested in cash and government\nsecurities.\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you on this key topic.\n\n1\n\nThe letter from all 12 Reserve Bank Presidents was sent on September 12 and can be found on the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston web site (http://www.bostonfed.org/news/press/2013/pr091213.htm) or on the\nSEC web site.\n2\n\nIncluding repurchase agreements collateralized by such instruments.\n\n3\n\nThese are iMoneyNet figures – weekly, as of September 3, 2013.\n\n4\n\nThis reflects the 2010 amendment to Rule 2a-7 that tightened the weighted average maturity limits and\nenacted liquidity requirements. See “Money Market Reform Final Rules”, Investment Company Act\nRelease No. IC-29132, May 2010.\n5\n\nThe Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) was\ndesigned to provide a market for asset-backed commercial paper to be sold by MMMFs. This facility was\nadministered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. For a full description and analysis of the program see\nBurcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick Parkinson, Eric Rosengren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul Willen, 2013,\n\"How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the AssetBacked Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\" in the Journal of Finance, vol.\n68(2), pages 715-737. The Temporary Guarantee Program (TGP) directly benefitted MMMFs by\nextending insurance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury. For details, see U.S. Department of\nTreasury, “Treasury Announces Temporary Guarantees Program for Money Market Funds,” September\n2008.\n6\n\nFor example, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was needed because of the inability of firms\nto roll over their commercial paper. The desire of MMMFs to shrink their assets was one reason why this\nprogram was needed.\n\n7\n\nThe FSOC proposed three reform alternatives: a floating NAV proposal, a risk-based capital buffer of 3\npercent, and a 1 percent minimum balance-at-risk proposal. See FSOC, “Proposed Recommendations\nRegarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform,” November 2012.\n8\n\nOn September 4, 2013, the European Commission released a proposed rule that would impose a 3 percent\nbuffer on money market funds that are fixed NAV funds.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n9\n\nTwo percent is referred to as the “default option.” However, the proposal notes that fund directors might\nchoose a lower fee if it is in the interest of the fund.\n\n10\n\nOthers have expressed concerns with fees and gates. For examples, see SEC comment letters from\nGoldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price, and Thrivent Financial.\n\n11\n\nSteffanie Brady, Ken Anadu, and Nathaniel Cooper provide a working paper that documents how\nextensive sponsor support for prime funds was during the crisis. See “The Stability of Prime Money\nMarket Mutual Funds Sponsor Support from 2007 to 2011,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, August\n2012.\n\n12\n\nUnder the SEC’s Investment Company Names rule, an MMMF may classify itself as a “government”\nfund if no less than 80 percent of its assets are in cash or government-related securities, including\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by such securities. See SEC, Investment Company Names; Final\nRule, Investment Company Act Release No. IC-24828, March 2001.\n\n15\n\n\f",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n“The Economic Outlook and\nMonetary Policymaking”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce\nBurlington, Vermont\nOctober 2, 2013\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a pleasure to be back\nin Vermont, where every season is wonderful but fall can be spectacular. I hope that a\nstrong foliage season this year will provide further support to a Vermont economy that\nhas recovered more quickly than the rest of New England, and much faster than many\nother parts of the country.\nI would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Tom Torti, president of the\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, and Ernie Pomerleau, president of\nPomerleau Real Estate here in Burlington. Ernie serves on the Boston Fed’s New\nEngland Advisory Council. It is one of our advisory groups, and provides an important\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nlink to what is happening within businesses around New England. At council meetings,\nErnie draws on his strong connections in Vermont to provide very helpful insights on\ntrends in the state’s business activity and economy. Tom and the Boston Fed have\nworked together for a number of years, and he was instrumental in helping us recruit\nErnie to that Advisory Council. Ernie and Tom were kind enough to make sure this\nopportunity to speak with you today came to fruition, and for that too I am grateful.\nThe Federal Reserve’s policymaking has been much discussed of late, in\nparticular in the two weeks since the monetary policy committee (the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or FOMC) last met. There has been significant public discussion and\ndebate over the Fed decision to continue with the program of purchasing $85 billion a\nmonth in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. There has also been a good deal of\ncommentary on the messaging that occurred in the lead-up to the meeting.\nToday I would like to explain my perspective, as one committee member. In\nparticular, I would like to describe why I thought the incoming economic data did not\nshow the progress I had hoped and expected at the time of the June FOMC meeting,\nwhen the committee discussed a possible reduction in the rate of asset purchases\nsometime in the fall.\nAs always, I would point out that my remarks today convey my own views, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\nSeveral factors caused me to strongly and unequivocally support continuation of\nthe Fed’s asset purchase program at the last policy meeting:\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n\n\nfirst and foremost, the disappointing incoming economic data, which had\nreduced my own and most participants’ forecasts for gross domestic product\n(GDP) this year and next;\n\n\n\nthe possibility of disruptions in the nation’s fiscal policies that might provide a\nfurther potential slowdown in economic activity, going forward; and\n\n\n\nlong-term market rates that had already risen more than I thought was\nconsistent with interest-sensitive sectors providing needed support to the\neconomy’s continued recovery.\n\nAsset purchases, like all monetary policy actions of the central bank, should be\nrooted in and dependent on incoming data. Forecasts are of course imperfect – and have\ntended to be overly optimistic over the previous four years. As a result, I believe we need\nto see data that compellingly suggest that over the next three years we are indeed on a\npath to reach full employment and 2 percent inflation. Today, I would like to review with\nyou some of the data that, to my thinking, indicated that conditions were not yet strong\nenough to assume the economy is on that positive and appropriate path – the data that led\nme to believe it would have been premature to begin reducing the rate of Fed asset\npurchases.\nIt is also important to emphasize that a policy that is data dependent cannot\nalways be “signaled” clearly, in advance. The FOMC forecasts can be wrong – reality\ndoesn’t always live up to our forecasts. Had U.S. fiscal matters not been so problematic,\nand incoming data on real GDP and employment stronger, it may well have been\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nappropriate to take some action in September. Unfortunately, those were not the facts we\nfaced, before the meeting.\nI would add that interpreting the data is an important and nuanced matter. The\nFOMC is a committee, and different participants can and often do have different\nperspectives on the strength of the incoming data. Some of the indicators the committee\nmust weigh in preparation for policy meetings include data that provide only partial\ninformation on an aspect of the economy – so that their import only becomes clear once\nwe have the fuller context provided by other, related data. Also, importantly, assembling\na coherent picture of the overall economy is challenging even with complete data, and\ninvolves “art” as well as science.\nThat points to the value of the committee members gathering together to arrive at\npolicy decisions. I will say that listening to the way in which other members, with\ndifferent perspectives, interpret the same data helps me form a more robust sense of\nwhere the economy is going. All this means that our fundamental reliance on data in\npolicymaking may result at times in less signaling, before FOMC meetings, about small\nchanges in the purchase program.\nI would hope it goes without saying, but let me take a moment to stress the\nfollowing. As Chairman Bernanke suggested in his press conference,1 Fed actions are\nnot determined by Wall Street’s expectations of what we might or should do. Rather, our\npolicies need to be consistent with achieving key goals like supporting Main Street’s\nmore rapid return to full employment – and keeping away the extremely low inflation that\ncharacterized troubled economies like Japan’s in its “Lost Decade” and moving toward\nthe Fed’s two percent inflation objective.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nI do not mean to imply that the communications and signaling issues of the last\nfew months have not been difficult, for many. Without question, there are difficulties\ninherent in communicating a data-contingent policy – but a data-contingent policy is far\npreferable to the alternatives. The Federal Reserve will continue to refine its policyrelated communications, but I would just point out that predictive certainty will never be\nthe case when policy is rooted in actual incoming data, which may or may not follow\nforecasts.\n\nRecent Economic Data\nWith that as introduction, let me now turn to the recent economic data that helped\ninform decisions at the September FOMC meeting. Figure 1 shows the path of the\nunemployment rate over the past five years. From the beginning of 2008, when the\nunemployment rate was 5 percent, the rate kept climbing – past the end of the recession.\nIndeed, it peaked at 10 percent in October of 2009. One year ago, the August\nunemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and as of August of this year the rate had fallen to\n7.3 percent. Clearly the unemployment rate has been declining since its peak – albeit\nslowly – and there has been slow but steady progress in reducing the rate over the past\nyear.\nHowever, other employment indicators have not been so positive. Figure 2\nprovides the labor force participation rate – the percent of the population 16 years of age\nand over that is either working or actively searching for work – over the past five years.\nIt has declined gradually over this period, which may mean the unemployment rate in the\nprevious chart underestimates reality.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nLet me explain why. The decline in the labor force participation rate reflects two\nfactors. The first is longer-term trends in demographics, like baby-boomers reaching\nnormal retirement age and leaving the labor force. But most estimates suggest that\ndemographics alone cannot account for all the change we have observed in labor-force\nparticipation. Unfortunately, the second factor reflects current weakness in the demand\nfor workers, apart from demographic and other factors. Some workers who were looking\nfor work have become discouraged by the shortage of job offers – a shortage that has\nbeen persisting over an extended period of time.\nWere the economy to strengthen, some of these workers would likely return to the\nlabor force as demand for labor increased. If the demand for labor were strong enough\n— if the number of new job openings matched the number of workers returning to the\nlabor force — we could see increases in payroll employment with little change in the\nunemployment rate.\nUnfortunately, what sounds like a temporary decline in the labor force\nparticipation rate could turn into a permanent one. A significant concern is that the\nlonger we have such an elevated unemployment rate, the more likely it is that some of\nthose who have left the labor force due to the lack of jobs will simply never return. In\nthis way the decline in labor force participation could become permanent, implying an\nongoing loss of employment and income for those workers – a very serious matter for our\nfellow citizens and for our economy.\nFigure 3 shows payroll employment growth over the past five years. Over the\npast year, payroll employment has grown by an average of 184,000 jobs per month – and\nfor a few months we were averaging over 200,000 jobs a month. Unfortunately, that pace\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nof job growth has recently slowed down. Over the past three months, payroll\nemployment has averaged only 148,000 jobs per month, which coupled with only 2\npercent growth in real GDP suggests the economy is in a “holding pattern” – just treading\nwater rather than gearing up to make significant improvement in the still very elevated\nunemployment rate.\nReal GDP has grown by just over 2 percent on average since the beginning of the\nrecovery more than four years ago. Unfortunately, growth this year has shown no\nimprovement over that pace, with real GDP advancing a little less than 2 percent in the\nfirst half of this year. Most private forecasters are projecting that growth in real GDP in\nthe third quarter will be roughly 2 percent once again.\nThe bright spot in real GDP through much of the recovery has been the interestsensitive sectors. Figure 4 shows that residential investment has been strong – in fact it\nhas averaged just over 15 percent growth over the last four quarters. This strength\ncomes, in part, in response to the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program, which was\ndesigned to lower market rates and boost interest-sensitive economic activity. Similarly,\nauto sales have been quite strong – helped by unusually low auto-loan rates, which reflect\ncompetitive forces among auto lenders (including community banks) as well as the Fed’s\nasset-purchase program. In short, the most interest-sensitive sectors have been growing\nstrongly, in part because of highly accommodative monetary policy.\nDespite the resilience of the interest-sensitive sectors, the overall economy has\ngrown much more slowly than is the norm for economic recoveries. Obviously, it is very\nimportant to understand what accounts for this persistently slow growth. Figure 5 shows\nthat for the first half of this year some sectors, like exports, have grown faster than 2\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\npercent despite weakness among many foreign trading partners. This is partially due,\nagain, to low interest rates – low rates mean a lower value for the dollar in relation to\nother currencies, which makes U.S. exports relatively more affordable overseas.\nBut the figure highlights that the main drag on the economy has come from\ndeclines in government spending at the state and federal level, coupled with the tax\nincreases that depressed consumer spending earlier this year.2 However you feel about\nthe political economy of fiscal matters, government spending is a component of GDP,\nand tax policy obviously affects consumer spending. I would note that historically\nspeaking, significant fiscal austerity such as we have recently seen is quite unusual at a\ntime when the economy is trying to recover from a severe recession. Figure 6 shows the\ncontribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP – historically\npositive, on average, but usually negative in the current recovery.\nI would echo Chairman Bernanke and others who urge a return to long-run fiscal\nsustainability, while observing that excessive austerity in the near-term subdues an\nalready tepid recovery. I would note that fiscal headwinds can – and have – come in the\nform of lower spending as well as higher taxes. To underline the end result, Figure 7\nshows just how restrained employment growth has been in the current recovery versus\nprevious ones.\nMost private forecasts had assumed that in the second half of this year the less\ninterest-sensitive components of consumer spending would pick up, and the headwinds\ncreated by fiscal austerity would begin to ebb. However, Figure 8 shows that, to date,\nconsumer spending has not picked up as hoped. And while some of the effects of fiscal\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nausterity will eventually ebb, to date fiscal austerity is one reason we have yet to see\ngrowth much faster than 2 percent.\nUnfortunately, this remains an area of significant uncertainty, given debates in\nCongress on continuing resolutions and potentially allowing the country to default on its\ndebt. The uncertainties, not to mention the outcomes themselves, threaten to have a\ncollateral impact on the rest of the economy.\nFigure 9 shows the central tendency (which excludes the three highest and three\nlowest projections) for the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.3 Comparing the\nleft and right bars in each chart, the figure makes clear that FOMC participants reduced\ntheir estimates of growth in real GDP between the June and September FOMC meetings.\nWhile earlier the expectation was for real GDP to grow 2.3 to 2.6 percent in 2013, the\ncentral tendency is now 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013. Similarly, projections for 2014 are\nfor an improvement over 2013, but are now lower than was anticipated at the June\nmeeting.\nIn short, the data arriving since June have not ratified the earlier expectation that\nthe increase in real GDP would occur this year, and many of the FOMC participants are\nnow expecting that pick-up to occur instead in 2014, although by a more modest\nmagnitude. That pattern of expected strength eventually disappointed by tepid reality has\npersisted for several years now.\nAt the same time that the economy seems to have slowed, the inflation rate\nremains quite low, as shown in Figure 10. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures\n(PCE) inflation rate has been low for the entire recovery, and is currently at only 1.2\npercent over the past year. Similarly, total PCE inflation has been running consistently\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nbelow our 2 percent target – only breaching 2 percent temporarily, in response to higher\noil prices earlier in the recovery. Total PCE inflation over the past year has averaged\nonly 1.2 percent, and oil prices have recently been declining as the possibility of a\nmilitary strike on Syria subsided.\nReturning to the Committee’s forecasts, Figure 11 provides the midpoint of the\ncentral tendency of participants’ forecasts for PCE inflation and core PCE inflation.\nThese forecasts show only a very gradual increase in inflation for both the total and core\nmeasures. My own forecast is quite similar, with both total and core measures of\ninflation over the next several years falling below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nUnfortunately, most of the risks to the outlook remain on the downside. Concerns\nover untimely fiscal austerity here and abroad, and the possibility of problems once again\nemerging in parts of Europe, could cause the Federal Reserve to miss on both elements of\nits dual mandate – employment and inflation – through 2016.\nIn my view, the asset-purchase program should remain dependent on incoming\neconomic data, and we should seek to get the economy on a path to achieve both\nelements of the Fed’s dual mandate – employment and inflation – as soon as possible,\nhopefully by 2016. Should the economy speed up more rapidly than is sustainable, we\ncan remove accommodation more quickly. Should the economy unexpectedly slow\ndown, we can and should provide more accommodation than is currently anticipated. If\nthe economy evolves as expected, policy should in my view include only a very slow\nremoval of accommodation over the next several years – and that should only occur when\nthe data ratify our forecast for an improvement in real GDP and employment.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe last FOMC monetary policy statement made clear that we are not following a\npredetermined path for monetary policy. Unfortunately, the incoming data do not show\nthe economic improvement that we had hoped for in June, and still ultimately expect.\nIt is likely that for such improvement we will need to see the fiscal headwinds\nsubside, and also see consumers become more confident. This would be consistent with\nmost private-sector forecasts that still anticipate an improving economy.\nHowever, in my view if the economy is not improving as expected, we should not\nreduce the monetary policy accommodation. Doing so risks slowing the sectors of the\neconomy that have shown the greatest strength – the interest-sensitive sectors that have\nbeen most responsive to policy actions. That, in turn, will prolong this period of elevated\nunemployment and slow job growth, turning what has been a long – but we hope still\ntemporary – economic disruption into one with very long-lasting undesirable\nconsequences for U.S. households and businesses.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20130918.htm\n\n2\n\nObviously business investment is also a weak spot. While it is certainly interest-sensitive, it also may be\nimpacted by fiscal uncertainty, only modest GDP growth, and subdued growth in consumer spending\n(consumption).\n3\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20130918.pdf\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOpening remarks at\nThe Council on Foreign Relations\n(The C. Peter McColough Series\non International Economics)\nNew York, New York\nOctober 11, 2013\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be invited to speak at the Council on Foreign\nRelations. Since my introductory remarks will focus on central bank communications, it\nis certainly appropriate that your format allows for plenty of time for questions and\ndiscussion. I would like to begin with a few opening comments, and summarize the two\nfigures you will find in your handout.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\nThe past several months have highlighted the communication challenges faced by\ncentral banks when short-term interest rates are close to zero – what we call the zero\nlower bound – and policy “tools” include communication about the sequence and nature\nof future actions. It is important to note that with any monetary policy action, the\nultimate impact is highly dependent on the reactions and expectations of a range of\neconomic actors – from financial market investors to firms making capital spending\ndecisions to households considering new purchases. Their decisions can either amplify\nor reduce the intended impact of policy. Given this dynamic, the ability to communicate\nclearly is crucial.\nUnfortunately, the communication challenges are not at all trivial. Combined\nwith the lack of historical precedent for many of the Fed’s recent monetary policy\nactions, these challenges make us realistic and humble about our ability to gauge the\nlikely impact of our communications at the zero lower bound.\nFigure 1 in your handout charts the movement of the 10-year Treasury bond since\nthe beginning of May, with the largest one-day movements shown in the table. The data\nover this roughly six-month period highlight that 10-year Treasury rates have been quite\nvolatile, and have tended to respond noticeably to monetary policy announcements and\nnew economic data – particularly data related to the monthly report on the employment\nsituation. That reflects, in part, prior communication about the Committee’s focus on the\nlabor market.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile long-term rates declined after the last FOMC announcement, they still\nremain about 100 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of May. Certainly\ncontributing to the rapid rise in long-term rates were announcements, speeches, and\ntestimony by Fed officials that indicated that if the economy were to improve as they\nexpected at that time, it might be appropriate to reduce the central bank’s monthly\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities sometime in the fall.\nThe reaction to the discussion of a possible reduction in Fed purchases appears to\nhave had an outsized impact on long-term rates. The recent market reactions provide a\nchallenge to the view, argued by some, that the purchase program has no impact – since\nasset prices seem so sensitive to announcements of even a potential, modest reduction in\npurchases sometime in the future.\nOf course, a monetary policy that affected only financial markets would have\nlittle chance of achieving the Fed’s Congressionally-mandated goals. In normal times,\nmonetary policy is transmitted largely through interest rates. Although we have used\nunusual policy tools, our efforts to lower interest rates are evident in consumer spending\nin the most interest-sensitive sectors, such as residential investment and auto sales.\nSo it would appear that recent monetary policy actions can have – and have had –\na meaningful impact on the economy. And the fact that the possibility of small future\nchanges in policy could elicit such large movements in market interest rates and asset\nprices emphasizes that while central bank communication can be a powerful tool, it has\nalso proven an imprecise and unpredictable instrument in terms of its impact on longterm rates.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHow should we think about using this powerful but hard-to-control tool? For me,\nthe primary objective of any communication should be to clarify how potential current\nand future actions are consistent with achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals\nof maximum employment and price stability within an acceptable period of time. In the\ncurrent situation, the national unemployment rate is at 7.3 percent (well above most\nestimates of full employment), and the personal consumption expenditures inflation rate\nis at 1.2 percent (well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent). As a result, forward-looking\npolicy needs to be focused on how we use the policy tools at our disposal to achieve the\ndual mandate in an acceptable time frame.\nThe economy is affected by a wide variety of events outside the control of\nmonetary authorities. The fiscal disruption over the past week or so is but one example\nof an event that was unlikely to have been fully incorporated in most forecasters’ baseline\noutlook – but nonetheless has the potential to affect how quickly we return to a path\nconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate.\nAs a result, the appropriate path for monetary policy needs to be flexible enough\nto respond to unexpected shocks, and alert to the evidence of their emergence in\nincoming data. Monetary policy should always be data-driven, and should respond if the\nlatest information suggests that the economy is likely to significantly diverge from the\nappropriate path.\nImportantly, though, no one data series is likely to fully capture the information\nthat policymakers need in order to make that determination. There are a large number of\nhigh-frequency macroeconomic data series on inflation, employment, and GDP, all of\nwhich provide nuanced signals about the direction of the economy. This means that\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npolicymakers cannot focus solely on any one data series or data element, but instead need\nto base policy decisions on a fuller set of data.\nUnfortunately, this also generates a communication problem. Saying that we will\nrely on all available data series, and that we will respond to news in the data that suggests\nwe are off the desired path for the economy, probably provides less clarity and guidance\nthan much of our audience desires. The resulting, inevitable uncertainty in this datadriven, multi-pronged approach may increase variability in financial markets, as different\nmarket participants sift through and interpret both the data and the public\npronouncements by officials of the central bank.\nAt the other extreme would be a very transparent and clear communication stating\nthat we will change our policy on a particular calendar date. But a problem with dates is\nthat if the economy’s path diverges significantly from what is anticipated, a calendarbound policy may be inconsistent with achieving our goals in an appropriate timeframe.\nHaving very clear communication that “locks” policy into an inappropriate move would\nclearly be undesirable.\nAn intermediate case could tie communication about policy to an important\neconomic variable. As long as that variable is a good proxy for overall economic\nconditions, it has the benefit of being transparent and observable, and thus easily\ncommunicated. The potential downside emerges if the variable stops serving as an\naccurate proxy for overall economic conditions, in which case it could lead to a poor\npolicy decision in much the same way as a rigid calendar date.\nFor example, the unemployment rate is a widely-used summary measure of labor\nmarket conditions. But despite its popularity, the unemployment rate is not always the\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbest summary indicator. A decline in the unemployment rate resulting from firms hiring\nmore workers would certainly be welcome at this time. However, a decline in the\nunemployment rate resulting from discouraged workers leaving the labor force would be\nunwelcome and would provide a quite different signal about the state of the economy. So\ntying policy to a particular outcome for one economic variable may be observable and\ntransparent, and reduce the uncertainty around monetary policy action – but could also\nprovide the wrong signal and could lead to policies that actually move the economy in a\ndirection inconsistent with the choice a policymaker would make with more flexibility.\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that most investors seem to focus on\ncalendar dates, not economic outcomes. As a result, investors will naturally translate\nguidance tied to economic outcomes into calendar dates, and that means caveats about\nconditionality, data-driven policy, and responsiveness to incoming data are likely to\nreceive far less attention than the translated calendar dates.\nFigure 2 shows results from a survey of primary dealers conducted before the\nSeptember FOMC meeting.1 Many market participants thought that there was a\nreasonably high probability of a reduction in Fed asset purchases in September, but many\nalso saw a relatively high probability that the FOMC might wait until a later date to\nadjust policy. Whatever the decision, a significant number of participants in the survey\nwere positioned to be disappointed. This lack of unanimity was likely to generate\nconsternation among those caught in an unfavorable financial position once the decision\nwas announced.\nNo calendar date was specified, and it was clearly communicated that the\neconomy needed to progress as expected for policy to be modified – but again, those\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncaveats tended to get much less attention. We saw weaker economic data emerge\nbetween the June and September FOMC meetings, and a higher than anticipated jump in\nmarket interest rates, along with the risk in September of possible fiscal-policy\ndisruptions. Given those data and risks, in my view continuing the asset-purchase\nprogram was warranted, and fully consistent with seeking to return to full employment\nand 2 percent inflation within a reasonable timeframe.\nHowever, the experience of the past several months makes it clear that a datadriven policy that also considers the risks to our forecasts can be difficult to\ncommunicate, because the policy will necessarily change as we update our forecasts and\nrisk assessments in the face of new economic data. This was emphasized in the\nSeptember FOMC statement, which made clear that asset purchases are not on a preset\ncourse.\nWe have more learning to do on how best to communicate monetary policy\nduring uncertain and unprecedented times. However, the most important thing we at the\nFed can, and should, communicate is that the policies we are setting are consistent with\nour goals – our mandate – for maximum employment and price stability. Getting the\nappropriate balance between flexibly implementing those policies and trying to\ncommunicate clearly and transparently to the public and to financial markets is likely to\nremain a work in progress.\nThank you again for the opportunity to be here today and to offer these opening\nremarks. Now I would be happy to respond to questions.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe University of Massachusetts Boston\nJohn W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy\nand Global Studies\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be here at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and to\nhave an opportunity to share my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. I\nwould like to thank Dean Ira Jackson and the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and\nGlobal Studies for hosting me today.\nIt has been quite a celebratory weekend in Boston, with both the World Series\nvictory parade on Saturday and the Patriots’ points-filled win on Sunday. Unfortunately,\nmy message today will be that while the economy has been gradually improving, it is not\nyet time to celebrate our economic performance.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\nSince the beginning of this year, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) totaling $85 billion per month. In\naddition, we have indicated our intention to keep short-term interest rates at their\nexceptionally low levels at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5\npercent and inflation and inflation expectations are well anchored. These two monetary\npolicy tools – asset purchases to push long-term rates lower, and guidance related to rates\nremaining low – have provided an accommodative monetary policy stance designed to\noffset some of the “headwinds” that have impeded a more rapid economic recovery.\nSince the beginning of this year the unemployment rate has declined from 7.9 to\n7.2 percent, interest-sensitive sectors such as housing and autos have continued to\nimprove, and inflation has stabilized at rates well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. This\nhas all occurred in the context of an economy wherein fiscal policy has been quite\nrestrictive, with higher income taxes as well as substantial reductions in real government\nspending. However you feel about the political economy of fiscal matters, government\nspending is a component of GDP, and tax policy obviously affects consumer spending.\nFrom a historical perspective, significant fiscal austerity such as we have seen recently is\nquite unusual at a time when the economy is trying to recover from a severe recession.\nWhile there have been some areas of improved economic performance,\nunfortunately the economy remains challenged. Unemployment is well above what\nanyone would consider a “full employment” rate, and inflation remains well below our 2\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npercent target. We should all be mindful that inflation can be too low – too close to\ndeflation. For example, deflation characterized troubled economies like Japan’s during\nits “Lost Decade.”\nOur hope is that the improvement in real GDP growth that many forecasters had\nexpected to be in progress by now will soon begin, and that the economy will grow fast\nenough to provide sustained improvement in labor markets along with inflation moving\ntowards the 2 percent inflation target.\nMonetary policy should, of course, respond to the actual state of the economy and\nincoming indicators, as well as the progress made to date – in other words, it should be\ndata dependent. But policy should also be forward-looking, taking into consideration\nhow long it is expected to take to return to full employment within a context of price\nstability.\nThat brings me to our current asset purchase program. As we see more\ncompelling evidence of a sustainable recovery making satisfactory progress toward full\nemployment, it may be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to gradually reduce the size of\nour large-scale asset purchase program. I would emphasize that when the Fed chooses to\ndo so, we will not be restraining the economy – in fact, we will still be adding stimulus to\nthe economy but in smaller increments than before.\nBy way of overview, today I will briefly review recent developments related to\nthe Federal Reserve’s monetary policies. I will highlight some areas of the economy\nwhere there has been progress, and other areas where we need to make more progress. I\nwill provide some sense of the likely time frame for returning to full employment, and\nprovide a few concluding observations.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Developments\nFigure 1 shows the Treasury yield curves (the market yields for an array of\nTreasury securities of various maturities) as of three dates this year. The first date is May\n1, before widespread discussion emerged about the Fed potentially reducing its purchases\nof long-term securities. As a benchmark, the 10-year rate at that time was 1.66 percent –\na quite low 10-year rate, by historical standards. Over the course of the summer, as the\nmarkets began to anticipate a higher probability of the Fed reducing the large-scale asset\npurchase program, the yield curve steepened significantly. Before the September FOMC\nmeeting, the 10-year rate was just below 3 percent – more than a 100 basis-point increase\nsince the beginning of May.\nThe steepness of the yield curve prior to the Fed’s September meeting was\nsomewhat surprising. Long-term rates rose quite appreciably – more than could be\nexplained by the heightened probability of a modest reduction in asset purchases, and\nmore than was desirable given the still-fragile economic recovery.\nAlso, since the Fed’s 6.5 percent unemployment “threshold” for maintaining very\nlow short-term rates had not changed, it was somewhat surprising how much the shorter\nterm rates moved in the marketplace. After all, reductions in the monthly rate of central\nbank purchases of long-term securities would not necessarily affect the length of time\nthat we would maintain very low short-term rates.\nThe third yield curve in Figure 1 is as of the end of October. The Fed had\nmaintained the pace of purchases at both the September and October FOMC meetings.\nAnd market participants had developed concerns over economic disruptions related to the\ndebt-ceiling debate and the partial shutdown of the federal government. The result, in\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsum, was some reduction of yields – with the 10-year rate now approximately 2.6\npercent.\nFigure 2 illustrates just how much market expectations changed around the\nSeptember FOMC meeting. Before the meeting, primary dealers participating in the\nsurvey placed an over 50 percent probability on the Fed reducing the scale of purchases\nof long-term Treasury and MBS securities at the September FOMC meeting, and a\ngreater than 90 percent probability on the first reduction in securities purchases occurring\nby the December FOMC meeting.\nWhen the survey was updated after the September FOMC meeting, but before the\ngovernment shut-down, there was a significant change. Now the probability of the first\nreduction in long-term securities purchases occurring at the December meeting was\nplaced at over 40 percent, with over a 40 percent probability placed on the first reduction\nnot occurring until next year.\nFinancial markets have been very focused on the timing of any reduction in asset\npurchases. Figure 3 shows the difference in the size of the central bank’s balance sheet\nunder two hypothetical approaches – reducing purchases beginning in December or\nbeginning in April. While the actual reduction decision (both the timing and speed of\nreductions) will need to consider the economic conditions prevailing at the time, and\nweigh the potential costs and benefits of different programs, the point of the figure is that\nstart dates differing by a quarter or two would generate only relatively small changes in\nthe overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. That is certainly one reason for being patient\n– waiting until evidence of a more sustainable recovery is more clear-cut – before\nbeginning any reduction in the size of the purchase program.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nFigure 4 shows the improvement in employment during this recovery relative to\nthe previous three. In the three earlier recoveries, employment returned to its previous\npeak within two years. While the two mildest recessions had relatively slower recoveries,\nthe deeper recession in 1981 had a steeper recovery. Unfortunately, the most recent\nrecession was deeper than the previous three, yet the recovery in employment has not\nbeen as rapid as in 1981. Despite the significant lapse of time since the trough of the\nrecession, we still have not reached the pre-recession peak in employment. The severity\nof the employment loss, and the significant headwinds facing the economy after the\nsevere financial crisis, are both important reasons why monetary policy has needed to\nremain quite accommodative.\nWhile there have been a variety of headwinds at play, one of the unusual features\nof this recovery has been the significant fiscal retrenchment. I am not here to comment\non fiscal policy, but to underline its effect on the economic situation that the Fed must\nrespond to. The CBO estimates that fiscal austerity measures have reduced 2013 GDP\ngrowth by 1.5 percentage points1 – a very significant headwind. Had the economy grown\nby 3.5 percent rather than 2 percent over the past year, job growth would almost surely\nhave been stronger, unemployment lower, and inflation closer to the two percent goal.\nAs a result, with the Federal Reserve focusing on achieving its mandates, absent some of\nthe fiscal headwinds there would be much less need for the current degree (and extended\nlength) of monetary policy accommodation.\nEven the direct effects of government employment reductions have been quite\nsubstantial. Figure 5 shows that, not including the employment peak resulting from the\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhiring of temporary census workers, government employment peaked at the end of the\nrecession and has been falling ever since – a cumulative loss of three-quarters of a\nmillion workers. This reflects very significant declines in employment by state and local\ngovernments, as well as in the federal government.\nFigure 6 shows that this is not the typical experience during an economic\nrecovery. All three of the previous recoveries were supported by additional government\nhiring, not by reductions in employees. In fact, the sharp recovery in total employment\nduring the 1982 recovery included a significant boost in government employment. As I\nmentioned earlier, there are obviously differing views on the politics of government\nspending and employment, but as a practical matter, fiscal austerity subtracts from\nemployment and from GDP. As the Federal Reserve pursues its Congressionallyassigned “dual mandate” for price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the\nsubstantial contractionary effects of fiscal retrenchment have to be taken into account –\njust as any other headwind has to be taken into account.\nIn particular, the tools of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases have\nbeen quite successful in keeping short- and long-term interest rates low, encouraging a\nrecovery in those sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates. For example,\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 show that residential investment and auto sales have been\nrecovering – and explain why, despite significant fiscal retrenchment, the economy has\nstill been able to average 2.2 percent growth since the start of the recovery in 2009.\nHowever, with short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound, monetary policy has not\nbeen able to fully offset the headwinds created by the financial crisis, fiscal retrenchment,\nand unusually weak economies among many trading partners.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 9 illustrates the combined effect of the weak and strong sectors on overall\nGDP during the recession and recovery. While the decline in real GDP was unusually\nlarge in this recession, real GDP has already exceeded its pre-recession peak (in contrast\nto the experience of employment).\nFigure 10 shows that this recovery has been slow, but slow growth appears to be\ncharacteristic of the last three recoveries as well. What has been more striking is that\nfiscal policy has become more restrictive, even though we have not seen the improvement\nthat one normally sees, over the past two years of the recovery.\n\nReturning to Full Employment\nFigure 11 illustrates the relationship between growth in the economy and how\nlong it is likely to take to return to full employment. My own estimate of the “full\nemployment level of unemployment” is a rate of 5.25 percent, although I would note that\nmy estimate is lower than some of my central bank colleagues, as illustrated by the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), which has a range for unemployment over the\nlonger run (in other words, unemployment levels consistent with optimal policy\noutcomes) of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.2\nThe relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate can be\nanalyzed using a modified Okun’s Law, which is an approximation of how much\nunemployment falls when the economy grows faster than its potential. While this\nrelationship is only an approximation of what might happen with a given GDP growth\nrate, it does provide some context for how long it would take to get to my estimate of full\nemployment, assuming different hypothetical rates of GDP growth.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe left-side bars provide the annual growth rate needed to reach my estimate of\nfull employment by the end of the indicated year. For example, if this relationship is\nabout right, to get to 5.25 percent unemployment by the end of 2016 would require an\naverage growth rate of 3.3 percent. With an assumed potential GDP growth rate of 2.1\npercent, we should recognize that a realized growth rate below 3 percent will result in a\nlong wait to reach my estimate of full employment. At a growth rate of 2.8 percent, we\ndo not attain 5.25 percent unemployment until the end of 2018. The right bars show that\ngrowth over the most recent recovery falls far short of the growth during the previous\nthree recoveries, and also well short of the growth needed to return to full employment\neven over the next five years.\nFigure 12 replaces the historical growth rates of real GDP during earlier\nrecoveries with the midpoint estimates of growth from the September Summary of\nEconomic Projections of the FOMC members. The SEP midpoint estimate of real GDP\ngrowth over the next three years is a little over 3 percent. Assuming the economy\nbehaves as estimated in the modified Okun’s Law, this would imply that we do not reach\nmy gauge of full employment until 2017.\nCertainly there are a number of important assumptions made in doing this\nanalysis, but it illustrates that unless the economy grows much faster than the 2.2 percent\nwe have experienced to date during the recovery, it will take quite some time to reach full\nemployment – and exact a heavy human toll.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nMonetary policy has been highly accommodative in order to mitigate the\nrestraining effects emanating from the financial crisis, fiscal restraint, and slow growth of\ntrading partners. Monetary policy has been able to partly but not fully offset these\nheadwinds, resulting in only a tepid recovery to date. Most private forecasts, and the SEP\nforecasts, expect growth to accelerate – but only modestly, to 3 percent as the effects of\nthese headwinds diminish. However, it is important to note that most of these forecasts\nsee us attaining these results only under the assumption of significant continued stimulus\nfrom monetary policy.\nLooking forward, on the plus side, firm and household balance sheets have\nimproved, recovery in stock and house prices have provided more capacity to resume\nconsumption patterns, the fiscal headwinds are expected to diminish somewhat, and some\nof our trading partners are showing signs of recovery. But a good portion of the gains in\nasset prices and in spending derive from the help that stimulative monetary policy has\nprovided. As a consequence, monetary policy is likely to need to remain accommodative\nfor some time so that we can achieve full employment within a reasonable forecast\nhorizon.\nEven when the Fed eventually removes some of its accommodation, such as\nlarge-scale asset purchases, we will in my view need to leave short-term interest rates at\ntheir very low levels until there is much more progress reaching full employment and the\n2 percent inflation target. Furthermore, the pace at which the Fed raises rates, when that\nbecomes appropriate, should be, in my view, quite gradual, unless the economy picks up\nmuch faster than is currently expected. Overall, monetary policy needs to continue to be\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndata driven and, of course, to be focused on meeting the Fed’s dual mandate – within an\nappropriate time frame.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you at UMass Boston.\n\n1\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2013), The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023\n(Washington: CBO, February), available at www.cbo.gov/publication/43907.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Financial Stability Institute of the\nBank for International Settlements:\nProgram for Financial Sector Supervisors\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\nNovember 18, 2013\n\nI would like to thank the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Arab Monetary Fund,\nand the Financial Stability Institute for inviting me to speak today. I would also like to commend\nJosef Tosovsky and the staff of the Financial Stability Institute for facilitating these global discussions\non very important bank-supervision and bank-regulation issues. Comparing implementation\nchallenges and sharing best practices in supervision and regulation are increasingly important in a\nglobal financial system, so gatherings like this are welcome. Indeed, we have been reminded in\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nrecent years that significant banking and financial problems in one country can have serious\nramifications that are far removed from the source of the original problem.\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the\nBoard of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nToday I will focus my comments on bank capital requirements, an area where we have made\nsubstantial progress – but also an area that has become increasingly complex. A particular challenge\nwith this added complexity is the difficulty in providing a transparent picture of the banking\norganization’s financial health when many of the calculations involve very granular, firm-specific\ninformation.\nThis complexity poses difficulties not only for the management of banking organizations and\ntheir supervisory agencies, but also for investors and, importantly, the public. When the regulatory\nenvironment becomes more difficult for investors to understand, the efficacy of market discipline can\nerode. Market discipline requires at very least that investors and the public can clearly understand the\nfinancial condition of firms. As a result, too much complexity may be costly.\nTransparent financial disclosures that promote effective monitoring of financial condition are\nvital. In a supervisory context, market signals can be an important tool for bank supervisors. Indeed,\nduring the financial crisis, market signals provided timely and useful information about the condition\nof financial institutions. Like others, I carefully examined stock price movements, subordinated debt\nspreads, availability of wholesale funding, and credit default swap spreads to better understand how\nmarkets were assessing the financial condition of institutions – and whether the market assessment\nwas at variance with what could be observed in supervisory reports.\nThe complexity of capital regulation is readily apparent in the annual reports and financial\nstatements of the largest U.S. banking organizations. The regulatory and capital sections often extend\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nfor more than 20 pages, consisting of dense discussions of capital regulation and measurement. While\nsome of this necessarily reflects the complicated nature of the business of global banking, I think it\nwould be beneficial to look for ways to streamline discussions in order to focus investors and the\npublic on those factors most relevant to the financial solvency of the firm.\nAllow me to preview some of the main points I will discuss today:\n\n\nI will argue that the increased attention on sufficient high-quality capital for banking\norganizations is extremely important, and represents an important “lesson learned and\napplied” coming out of the financial crisis. In the United States, this increased attention\nhas resulted in a significant increase in the quantity and quality of capital that most U.S.\nbanking organizations have on hand to withstand possible future shocks.\n\n\n\nI will suggest that at least some of the complexity could, and probably should, be reduced\nif the so-called “Pillar 3” goals of increased transparency and market discipline are to be\nachieved.\n\n\n\nI will argue that, because of the variety of banking models and their associated risks, both\nrisk-based capital requirements and leverage-based capital requirements are likely to\ncontinue to be needed. Consider the fact that the capital ratios of the largest banking\norganizations are comparable to those of the wider group of bank holding companies with\nmore than $50 billion in assets when using risk-based capital – but are low relative to\nthose banking organizations when using the leverage ratio.\n\n\n\nI will note that a number of the largest global banking organizations have significant\nbroker-dealer operations and are highly dependent on wholesale funding. This funding\nstructure makes them inherently more susceptible to runs, suggesting that their relatively\nlow leverage-ratio capital may not be appropriate. I would note that Federal Reserve\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nGovernor Dan Tarullo has focused on the dependence on wholesale financing in several\nspeeches, and on the need for higher capital charges for institutions that are heavily reliant\non this less stable funding model.1\n\nThe Financial Crisis and Capital Regulation\nOne of the positive things to emerge from the financial crisis of 2008 was a renewed emphasis\non increasing the quantity and quality of the capital cushion in the banking system. Enhancements to\ncapital requirements played an important role in forcing firms to increase capital. New supervisory\ntools have been critically important as well. In particular, the stress tests that require banking\norganizations to consider whether they have sufficient capital under stress scenarios designed by bank\nsupervisors have, in many cases, provided significant impetus to improve capital positions.\nAs is shown in Figure 1, since the financial crisis the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio has\nincreased significantly for bank holding companies of all sizes.2 This improvement in a relatively\nnarrowly defined capital measure has led to the presence of significantly more loss-absorption\ncapabilities than U.S. banks had, prior to the crisis.\nWhile the increased attention to improving the size and quality of capital positions of banking\norganizations should reduce insolvency risks at many institutions and enhance the ability of the\neconomy to sustain negative shocks, this attention has also generated a much more complicated set of\ncapital regulations. An examination of the 2012 annual reports of the largest banking organizations\nhighlights just how complicated capital regulations have become. It is not unusual for the largest\nbanks to devote considerable space in their annual reports, or separate papers, to discuss at length the\nregulatory environment and their implementation of capital regulations. This complexity makes\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nevaluations of banks’ financial conditions challenging and makes it more difficult to make\ncomparisons across banking organizations.\nThe complexity stems from several factors. First, many firms report on their positions relative\nto Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III capital requirements. This reflects the fact that Basel I is the current\ncapital regulation in the United States, but some of the largest firms are discussing Basel II capital\nrequirements that they are running in parallel, and most large banking organizations are now also\nreporting what they expect their capital position will be under Basel III.\nThis is primarily a transition problem, but the transition to full implementation of Basel III is\nnot scheduled to be completed internationally for another five years. A possible simplification over\ntime might be that once large banking organizations are fully compliant with Basel III, they no longer\nalso report capital under earlier frameworks. That said, once Basel III has been fully adopted,\nsignificant complexity will still remain.3\nA second form of complexity results from the variety of measures of capital. Figure 2\nhighlights the variety of capital being used. Tier 1 common equity is generally the narrowest\ndefinition of capital reported, focusing on those elements of capital best able to absorb losses. Tier 1\ncapital is less narrow. Total risk-based capital has an even broader definition.4 The leverage ratio\nuses Tier 1 capital but is relative to a measure close to average total assets, rather than risk-weighted\nassets.\nU.S. Basel III implementation will include a supplementary leverage ratio – the ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to total leverage exposure – of at least 3 percent for large global banks. This ratio broadens the\ndenominator from average total assets to total leverage exposure. Also under consideration for the\nlargest global banks is an additional Tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio, for a total of 5 percent.5\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOne potential simplification would be to focus only on the narrower definition of capital, Tier\n1 common equity. During the financial crisis, investors and regulators focused on narrow definitions\nof capital, given the urgency around loss absorption capabilities. Potentially de-emphasizing the\nreporting of the broader measures of capital would simplify financial statements, and would create\nmore focus on the capital base with the best loss-absorption capability – where investors and\nregulators should likely concentrate.\nA third form of complexity emerges from the complications involved in risk-weighting assets\nfor risk-based capital calculations. Making capital ratios more risk sensitive has the benefit of\ndiscouraging shifts to riskier assets as a means to maximize near-term profitability at the expense of\nfuture viability. However, the need to rely on models and judgment gives rise to complexity and\nperpetuates the challenges of comparability across firms that may use very different risk models – and\nsome of those models may be in different stages of development. In fact, a recently published paper\nassociated with the Basel process has sparked discussion of whether greater simplification would be\ndesirable.6\nA fourth form of complexity stems from the use of both risk-based capital ratios and leverage\nratios. But the need for both capital ratios reflects in part the complexity of banking organizations’\nactivities. In other words if all banking organizations had similar business models, it might not be\nnecessary to use both ratios.\nFor a banking organization that primarily takes deposits and makes loans, its reliance on\nwholesale funding is low, the risk of runs is limited by deposit insurance, and much of the risk to the\ninstitution derives from the riskiness of its loan portfolio. However, many global banking\norganizations have concentrated their operations in less traditional banking activities. For example,\nmany global banking organizations have large broker-dealer operations. In this case they are heavily\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nreliant on wholesale funding, they have few deposits covered by deposit insurance, and their greatest\nrisk is that the wholesale financing they need in order to fund (i.e., to keep rolling over) their\nsecurities portfolio during a crisis will not be available, causing a severe liquidity problem.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the liabilities of bank holding companies with broker-dealer operations\ncan be quite different from those of bank holding companies without broker-dealer operations, given\nthe former’s dependence on wholesale funding rather than deposits. This makes the likelihood of\nliability runs dependent on a firm’s business model, with those firms reliant on wholesale funding\nmuch more likely to experience a liability run during a crisis. New liquidity measures will reduce\nsome of the mismatch, but given the importance of financing long-term securities with short-term\nfinancing as part of the business model, the new liquidity measures may not be sufficient. Larger\ncapital positions for firms with a business model reliant on wholesale funding will help to further\nreduce the likelihood of a liability run.\nI would now like to delve further into this difference for large banking organizations.\n\nLeverage and Risk-based Capital Requirements\nBroker-dealers tend to hold large securities portfolios, many of which carry low risk weights\nbecause the risk weighting is based on credit risk – that is, default risk. Less capital is required for\nassets with a lower risk weighting. Because of the low risk weighting on their primary assets, brokerdealers tend to have high risk-based capital ratios.\nHowever, for these organizations the riskiness of their assets is significantly compounded by\nthe riskiness of their funding model – that is, the risk that their short-term financing, accomplished\nthrough repurchase agreements and other wholesale funding arrangements, might dry up with a\nfinancial shock and not be available to finance their longer-term securities portfolio. Should investors\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nlose confidence in these firms, broker-dealers can be forced to sell securities at fire-sale prices,\ncausing solvency and liquidity concerns.\nThese concerns are far from theoretical, in that many difficulties in the fall of 2008 stemmed\nfrom runs on institutions that were reliant on wholesale funding – and many of those firms failed or\nwere acquired. I would add that some of the largest U.S. global banking organizations have\nsignificant broker-dealer operations, some of which were acquired during the financial crisis.\nFigure 4 shows the Tier 1 common equity capital position of U.S. bank holding companies by\nasset size. Bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion in assets appear relatively well\ncapitalized relative to smaller bank holding companies. Most of the large bank holding companies\nhave more than 10 percent Tier 1 common equity capital relative to risk-weighted assets. Figure 5\nshows that this is true for even the largest bank holding companies. Nine of the ten largest U.S. bank\nholding companies have Tier 1 common equity capital ratios over 10 percent.7\nFigure 6 shows the leverage ratio of U.S. bank holding companies, by asset size. The largest\nbank holding companies do not appear as well capitalized when using the leverage ratio, which does\nnot use risk-weighted assets as a denominator. More of the bank holding companies with greater than\n$50 billion in assets have less than 8 percent leverage ratio capital compared with smaller bank\nholding companies.\nFigure 7 shows that the 10 largest bank holding companies have among the lowest leverage\nratios of the largest bank holding companies. Six of the ten have leverage ratios below 8 percent.\nThis is not reflected in other large bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets; most\nof these banks have leverage ratios above 8 percent.\nFigures 8 and 9 illustrate one of the reasons for this difference. The 10 largest US\ndomestically owned bank holding companies are categorized by the relative importance of their\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nbroker-dealer operations. Those with very large broker-dealer operations tend to be high on the Tier 1\ncommon equity ratio, but low on the leverage ratio. Given the risks that broker-dealer funding models\npose, and the failure of many of the large broker-dealers during the crisis, it would seem appropriate\nthat these organizations should be holding more capital. Certainly one way to achieve this would be\nto impose capital charges for bank holding companies highly reliant on wholesale funding.\nThese differences in business lines highlight why a risk-based capital requirement alone is not\nsufficient. Many of the largest banking organizations are less reliant on deposits and more reliant on\nwholesale funding as a result of their large broker-dealer operations. For these organizations, the\nprimary risk issue is the riskiness of their funding model. As a result, using only credit-risk-based\nmeasures of capital may not capture the “true riskiness” of these organizations.\nGiven all this, I would argue that the leverage ratio is an important supplement to risk-based\ncapital requirements. While the leverage ratio is not designed to explicitly capture wholesale funding\nrisk, it in effect serves this purpose because of the higher weight it gives to low-risk assets – which are\nthe very assets that wholesale funding typically supports.\nIn sum, the business models of some bank holding companies span diverse activities,\nparticularly among the largest organizations. Broker-dealer operations carry high risk-weighted\ncapital ratios because they hold low-risk assets – but they are still highly leveraged.\n\nConcluding Observations\nBank holding companies have responded to more regulatory and supervisory scrutiny of\ncapital by raising their capital ratios. This should position banking organizations to have greater loss\nabsorption capacity, should it be necessary.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nHowever, along with the increased focus on capital regulation has come significantly more\ncomplexity. To the extent that this complexity makes it more difficult for investors and depositors to\ndistinguish the financial condition of bank holding companies, there is the potential that the\ncomplexity could weaken the third pillar of Basel III market discipline. Now that many of the\nregulations are being implemented, there should be thoughtful consideration as to whether\nstreamlining the rules could maintain the same level of capital adequacy assurance with lower cost to\nbanking organizations, regulators, and investors.\nSome of the complexity in bank capital regulation is unavoidable. Global banking\norganizations are in a variety of business activities, some of which take sophisticated modeling to\nassess the risk of the activity. However, potential ways to streamline capital regulation would be to\nplace greater emphasis on narrow capital definition, such as Tier 1 common equity – and to\naccelerated emphasis on Basel III.\nIn contrast, the complexity of business models may make it difficult to rely on only risk-based\ncapital requirements. The range of risks in business models – on both the asset side and the liability\nside of balance sheets – may make the funding model more risky than is captured by only using riskbased capital requirements. The leverage ratio is a particularly important supplemental tool for global\nbanking organizations that are heavily reliant on wholesale funding. For many of these firms, the\nbusiness model is less traditional than for smaller banks – and more at risk of experiencing funding\nproblems potentially requiring fire sales of assets.\nLarge broker-dealers in many large bank holding companies exemplify this risk. By funding\nsecurities portfolios with shorter term wholesale funding, their risks are not fully captured by relying\nonly on risk-based capital ratios. Large global banking organizations with large broker-dealers are\norganizations where leverage ratios and capital charges on wholesale funding are particularly\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nappropriate. Currently, many of these very large organizations have lower leverage capital ratios than\nare observed at more traditional large bank lenders.\nLet me leave you with this view: global banks with significant investment banking and brokerdealer activities pose significant potential risk to the financial system and should be among the best\ncapitalized large banking organizations.\nThank you.\n\nNotes:\n1\n\nSee Tarullo, D. (2013, May), Evaluating Progress in Regulatory Reforms to Promote Financial Stability. Speech\npresented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C. See also Tarullo, D.

Both speeches can be found at http://www.federalreserve.gov.\n2\n\nThe analysis for this talk includes bank holding companies that are Y-9C filers.\n\n3\n\nThe Basel III rule augments both the general risk-based capital requirements (Basel 1) as well as the “advanced\napproaches” risk-based capital requirements (Basel 2), but both the general and advanced risk-based capital requirements\nremain in effect for advanced-approaches firms. As a result of the dual compliance requirement (i.e., the Collins\namendment), the more binding of the two regulatory capital requirements at any given point in time is the effective riskbased capital requirement.\n\n4\n\nTier 1 common equity is generally the most narrow definition of capital reported, and focuses on those elements of\ncapital best able to absorb losses. Tier 1 equity capital is less narrow and allows banks to include qualifying perpetual\npreferred stock, qualifying minority interests, and qualifying trust preferred securities. Total risk-based capital is an even\nbroader definition and includes qualifying subordinated debt, a portion of the loan loss allowance, and other Tier 2 capital\nelements.\n5\n\nThe final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in the U.S., approved on July 2, 2013, includes a\nminimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. For banking organizations using advanced approaches, there\nis an additional requirement, a supplementary leverage ratio – the ratio of tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure – of at\nleast 3%. On July 9, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency adopted the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Under this\nproposed rule, bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in assets or $10 trillion in assets under custody\n(covered BHCs) would also be required to maintain a tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3%, for a total of 5%. In addition, depository institutions of\ncovered BHCs would be required to meet a 6% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well capitalized.” See the\nJuly 2, 2013 Final Rule – BOG press release and The Federal Register, October 11, 2103, Vol. 78 ,No 198, p 62018, CFR\nParts 208, 217 and 225.
