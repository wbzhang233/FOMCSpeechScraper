Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nNovember 17, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins emphasized that the two aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate are complementary.\nWhile there often is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has\nshown that price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy – it is an important\nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. So, both aspects of the dual\nmandate are interrelated and complementary.\n2. A challenge for the Fed, explored at this conference, is how to operationalize a broad\nconcept of full employment when setting monetary policy.\nFull employment has often been defined by referencing an unemployment rate. But no one\nstatistic can adequately characterize the labor market, since aggregate numbers do not show the\nwide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.\n3. Collins emphasized the connection between the full employment goal and the Fed’s role\nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone.\nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic\noutcomes – including but not limited to employment. This underutilization of the workforce\nadversely affects national productivity and prosperity.\n4. A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if the\nFed is to meet both its full-employment and price-stability goals, said Collins.\nThe aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full employment when the\nlabor force participation rate is changing. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor\nsupply expands, and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price\npressures requiring tighter monetary policy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can\nbenefit those drawn into the labor market.\n5. It is essential to examine factors that could limit people from participating in the\neconomy, and to support research and collaborations that promote economic progress.\nThe Fed’s mandate and the concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to\nparticipation in the workforce, and the challenges that can prevent people from doing so (for\nexample child care, housing, and infrastructure). Often these impediments are long-run, structural\nfactors that cannot be resolved with monetary policy. However, to assess the productive capacity\nof the economy, the Fed needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving. And a\nbetter understanding can lead to expanded opportunities for more people.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIt is truly a pleasure to be opening my second Boston Fed economic conference,\nthe Bank’s sixty-seventh. I’m especially pleased to be doing so with Egon Zakrajšek,\nour new Director of Research and chief economic advisor.\nAlong with the entire economic research team, Egon and I are committed to\nmaintaining all that is special about the Boston Fed economic conferences. Over the\nyears, these conferences have engaged a wide range of participants on complex issues\nwith practical policy relevance. These conferences, and the learnings they yield, help\nus at the Boston Fed pursue our vision of a vibrant economy that works for all; and our\nmission to serve the public by supporting a strong, resilient, and inclusive economy.\nThis year, we focus on full employment – one pillar of the Fed’s dual mandate.\nAnd we build on last year’s conference, which addressed the potential effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the labor market. Of course, our conferences do not always\ncover labor market issues; however, these topics have been especially critical lately.\nWe have much to do over the next day and a half – so, let’s begin. My role today\nis not only to welcome you and kick things off, but also to set the stage by providing a\nbit of my own perspective as a monetary policymaker. Of course, I’ll add my standard\ndisclaimer – the views I express are my own, and I’m not speaking for any other Federal\nReserve policymaker.\n\nFull Employment in Context\nI’ll begin with some historical context on full employment as a policy\nresponsibility. In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, Congress\ndeclared – in the Employment Act of 1946 – that the federal government was\nresponsible for fostering “conditions … to promote maximum employment.” However, a\nFederal Reserve mandate for full employment was not formally adopted until the late\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n1970s. 1 The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 added the goal of “maximum\nemployment” to the Fed’s responsibility for price stability — leading to the dual\nmandate. This legislation was part of a broader effort in Congress to reaffirm the role of\ngovernment entities in promoting full employment, which culminated in the HumphreyHawkins Act of 1978. 2,3\nOf course, the Fed is not the only central bank that tries to balance price stability\nand full employment. However, our legislative history has made the Fed one of the few\ncentral banks where a full-employment mandate is on an explicit equal footing with a\nprice-stability goal.\nIn this context, I’ll reiterate my perspective on the dual mandate. While there\noften is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has shown\nthat price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy. In particular, it is an\nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. So, in a\nvery real sense, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.\n\nFull Employment and a Vibrant Economy\nI want to emphasize the connection between full employment and the Fed’s role\nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone, not just for some people. This is\ncentral to the questions we will explore at this conference.\n\nEarlier legislation had referenced a role of the Federal Reserve, but it was not until 1977 that such a role\nwas codified. See then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s 2013 speech “A Century of U.S. Central Banking:\nGoals, Frameworks, Accountability”:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130710a.htm.\n1\n\n2 Humphrey-Hawkins stated the government’s responsibility to “use all practicable programs and policies\nto promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth,\nproper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability.” The act expired in 2000, though the\nFederal Open Market Committee is still mandated to present semi-annual reports to Congress assessing\nthe state of the economy and monetary policy.\n\nFor more on the history and evolution of the dual mandate, see Aaron Steelman’s Economic Brief for the\nRichmond Fed: https://www.richmondfed.tv/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11-12\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWe know that aggregate data show average economic conditions, and not\nnecessarily the experiences of specific subsets or groups. But we also know that, for\nsome people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in\neconomic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. A truly healthy economy\nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with ample\nopportunities to work, contribute, and prosper.\nThe Fed’s mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our\nfocus to participation in the economy and the workforce, and the challenges that can\nprevent people from doing so. These include real economic issues like child care,\nhousing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.\nThe Boston Fed has a decades‐long history of studying disparities for groups and\nplaces. 4 We believe better understanding these gaps can lead to expanded\nopportunities for more people – and to those opportunities being more equitably\navailable. This helps bring more people into the workforce, and strengthens economic\ngrowth and competitiveness. We are committed to examining factors that could limit\npeople from participating in the economy, and where possible, to supporting research\nand collaborations that expand prospects for progress.\nThis work relates directly to our mission and mandate. And in that context, it is\nimportant to remember that the Fed’s portfolio of activities is considerably broader than\njust our core monetary policy work. In our supervisory, payments, and communityoutreach efforts, we promote financial stability and economic inclusion, access to credit\nfor firms and households, and an efficient and reliable payments system. Community\n\n4 We conduct research, and have hosted conferences, exploring disparities in economic opportunities.\nExamples include the 1990s Boston Fed work on discrimination in mortgage lending (see\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/10/landmark-boston-fed-hdma-paperrecapped.aspx), and the Boston Fed’s 2019 research conference, which explored the growing geographic\ndisparities in economic outcomes (see https://www.bostonfed.org/news-andevents/news/2019/10/boston-fed-economic-conference-on-reducing-inequality-between-places.aspx and\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/housedivided2019.aspx).\n\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndevelopment activities, including our Working Places initiatives 5, provide examples of\nhow to encourage local partnerships in New England’s smaller cities and rural areas, to\nincrease economic opportunities and progress. Our roles and responsibilities in the\npublic interest also include rigorous, nonpartisan research on key economic issues,\nalong with convening stakeholders, policymakers, and experts around issues of\nimportance – such as in conferences like this one.\n\nAssessing and Measuring Full Employment\nTurning now to the relationship between full employment and monetary policy, a\nchallenge for the Federal Reserve is how to operationalize a broad concept of full\nemployment. I’d like to highlight some of the issues we face when translating the broad\ngoal of full employment into specific monetary policy decisions.\nFull employment has often been defined by referencing an unemployment rate.\nSpecifically, the economy has been thought to be at full employment when the\nunemployment rate equals the natural rate of unemployment – the rate of\nunemployment consistent with a normal pace of economic growth in the medium to\nlonger run. The aggregate unemployment rate is a useful summary indicator for broad\noverall labor market conditions. 6 But no single statistic can easily characterize a\ncomplex and evolving labor market.\n\nThe Boston Fed’s Working Places programs are based on research into resurgent post-manufacturing\ncities, and support the Fed’s full employment mandate. Research suggested smaller-city economic\nresurgence depends on a city’s ability to mobilize its civic infrastructure — leaders, organizations,\nnetworks, and resources — to pursue a shared economic vision. So the programs support cross-sector,\nlocal leadership teams (with public, private, nonprofit, and community members) with shared goals. Team\ngoals and strategies are chosen locally, based on need and opportunity. Winning communities receive\ngrants provided by partners (not the Fed) including states, the private sector, and philanthropy. See\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/initiatives.aspx.\n5\n\nIn particular, the unemployment rate has proven helpful in modelling the short-run tradeoff between real\nactivity and inflation that is summarized by the Phillips Curve. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also\npublishes multiple measures of unemployment that try to capture different dimensions of labor\n6\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSince aggregate numbers do not show the wide range of experiences across\ngroups of people, sectors, and places, we also review disaggregated labor-market data.\nFor example, one sees persistent disparities in unemployment for different racial and\nethnic groups, and across education levels.\nUnemployment rates that are persistently higher by race, or by place – as they\nhave been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our country’s labor resources, and\nthat adversely affects national productivity and prosperity. Indeed, in the past – even\nwhen the unemployment rate was at what was considered the natural rate – many\npeople, groups, and places were excluded from full labor market participation. That is,\nlabor market conditions at “full employment” have not served as a rising tide that equally\nlifts all boats. That had negative consequences for the affected people, as well as for\noverall economic performance.\nRecent history provides some important insights. First, looking back at labor\nmarket developments during and after the 2007-2009 Great Recession, we can see\nhow an aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full\nemployment when the labor force participation rate is changing. After the Great\nRecession, the aggregate participation rate fell dramatically. Some of this decline\nstemmed from long-run structural forces beyond the Fed’s control, such as population\naging. But some of the decline resulted from the large drop in labor demand during the\nrecession, which led to many workers becoming discouraged and dropping out of the\nlabor force. To meet its full-employment mandate, the Fed had to determine how much\nof the participation decline was structural and how much was cyclical and could\npotentially be addressed by accommodative monetary policy.\nMore recently, we’ve seen another example of how labor force participation\nmatters for full employment. Since the acute phase of the pandemic ended, labor\ndemand has been outstripping the supply of available workers. A goal of current\n\nunderutilization. For more detail, see https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/the-unemployment-rate-andbeyond-alternative-measures-of-labor-underutilization.pdf.\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmonetary policy is, of course, to restore a better balance in the labor market, with higher\ninterest rates working to slow labor demand in this realignment process.\nBut recently, part of the move toward a better balance has come through an\nincrease in labor supply. The labor force participation rate for prime-aged workers\n(ages 25-54) is higher today than it was just before the pandemic – a development that\nfew expected even a year ago. And some of the larger gains in participation have\noccurred among women and minority groups.\nA better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if\nthe Fed is to meet both its full-employment and price-stability goals. 7 If labor supply\nexpands to meet demand in tight labor markets, then higher levels of economic activity\nin such times may not generate additional price pressures requiring tighter monetary\npolicy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can benefit those brought into\nthe labor market, contributing to a vibrant economy that works for all.\n\nA More Inclusive Perspective on Full Employment\nThis process was at work in the late 2010s, when the aggregate labor force\nparticipation rate stopped falling as labor markets became progressively tighter.\nMembers of some disadvantaged groups were drawn into the labor force as this\noccurred. And the gains to those groups – and to the overall economy – were\nsubstantial. 8\nFed Chair Jay Powell highlighted these significant and beneficial effects on\nseveral parts of the population in his August 2020 Jackson Hole speech announcing the\nnew monetary policy framework. He recognized that “the robust job market was\n\nOther factors impacting full employment, not discussed here, are also important, such as the\nrelationship between job vacancies and unemployment.\n7\n\nAfter bottoming out in 2015, the labor force participation rate of prime age workers rebounded by about\n1.5 percentage points, roughly equivalent to 3 million additional workers. Employment increased by an\neven larger amount – about 4.3 million – given that the unemployment rate was falling over this period.\n8\n\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndelivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities,\nparticularly at the lower end of the income spectrum. In addition, many who had been\nleft behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and\nincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\n9,10\n\nConsistent with the recognition of the different labor market experiences across\nindividuals and groups, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, noted as part of\nthe 2020 framework review that full employment is a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”\nThe new framework also removed references to the FOMC’s longer-run estimates of the\nunemployment rate in assessing progress toward full employment. These changes deemphasized the use of a natural or long-run rate of unemployment as the key metric for\nassessing full employment.\nIn my view, the revised framework reflects the complexity of assessing full\nemployment in a rapidly evolving economy. And, by moving away from a definition of\nfull employment that is based primarily on aggregate unemployment, the new\nframework encourages Fed policymakers to better understand potential barriers to\nparticipation for some workers during “normal” times.\nIn many cases, these impediments are long-run, structural factors that cannot be\nresolved with monetary policy. 11 Government policies designed to reduce skills gaps or\nameliorate child care problems over the long run will be fiscal, not monetary, policies. 12\n\n9\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 the System held several “Fed Listens” meetings to gain a better understanding of the\nlabor market experiences of different groups that were an important part of the monetary-policy\nframework review process. Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (federalreserve.gov). The System is\ncontinuing these “Fed Listens” meetings. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm.\n10\n\nThese barriers often reflect structural impediments such as lack of child care options, lack of\ninformation about job opportunities, or lack of appropriate skills.\n11\n\nImprovements in technology and changes in business practices can also reduce barriers without policy\ninterventions. As an example, the growth of working-from-home is thought to be a key reason why the\nparticipation rates of persons with disabilities have risen so much since the pandemic. Our conference\n12\n\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, to assess the long-run productive capacity of the economy, the Fed\nalso needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving over time. And the\nlabor force participation increases during the late 2010s and after the pandemic indicate\nthat the impediments could be less problematic when labor markets are tight. As a\nresult, understanding these barriers from both the long-run and short-run perspectives is\nessential, if the Fed is to fulfill its dual mandate. And of course, as I noted earlier, this\nalso aligns with our broader portfolio of work, including our role as a nonpartisan\nresource, convener, and partner to support a vibrant economy for our region and the\ncountry.\n\nOur Conference\nIn that spirit, over the next day-and-a-half we’ll hear from paper authors,\npanelists, and discussants on many of the issues surrounding full employment,\nincluding how best to measure it. Two panels will explore the challenge of assessing\nfull employment in real time, and whether the Fed should probe for full employment late\nin expansions. These topics relate to the types of data that the Fed should use to\nevaluate full employment, as well as to the potential benefits and costs of tight labor\nmarkets.\nWe will also learn more about potential barriers faced by some groups —\nincluding women, racial minorities, and people with criminal histories. Other sessions\nwill review the evidence on programs designed to increase workers’ skills and will\ndiscuss the growth of “gig” work in the economy. Our keynote speaker, Cecilia Rouse,\nwill explore the roles that a strong labor market and supportive government policies may\nhave played in generating the rapid and remarkably equitable recovery from the\npandemic.\n\nlast year discussed potential long-run changes in labor markets brought on by the pandemic, so we won’t\nfocus as closely on those issues this year.\n8\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere thanks to our keynote speaker, the paper\nauthors and discussants, and the panelists for their contributions to this conference. I\nknow we will also have excellent comments and questions from the floor and during the\nbreaks, so my thanks to each of you for joining us. I also warmly welcome those tuning\nin to the live stream.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn things over to my colleague Chris Foote, who will\nmoderate our first panel.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nOctober 12, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins knows inflation is still taking a toll across New England, but inflation is moderating.\nIn her travels around New England, Collins has spoken with residents and business owners who are\ncontinuing to struggle with higher prices. But she sees the Fed making progress in its efforts to lower\ninflation, as some signs are emerging that demand and supply are realigning.\n2. Despite some favorable indicators, Collins says it’s too soon to be confident that inflation is on a\nsustained trajectory back to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nCollins says much of the recent moderation in the core inflation measure is due to declines in core goods\ninflation, which can be traced to improvements in supply chain conditions. But she adds that firms’\nincentives to pass on these costs savings may be short-lived unless demand slows. Meanwhile, core\nservices inflation remains elevated.\n3. The recovery from the pandemic has been unusual, and Collins says that in this highly uncertain\nenvironment, policymaking requires patience.\nCollins says that policymakers need time to draw conclusions about the data and allow special factors that\nhave been supporting near term activity to play out. She adds it’s unlikely we’ve yet seen the full effects of\nthe Fed’s actions to date, so patience is critical as policymakers weigh the risk of inflation remaining\npersistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.\n4. Recent increases in long-term interest rates reinforce Collins’ view that we’re very near or\nperhaps at the peak of the current tightening cycle.\nCollins noted the 10-year Treasury yield has moved up since mid-September, and that increase has been\naccompanied by higher corporate bond yields and mortgage rates. Collins says the rise in these rates\nimplies some tightening of financial conditions, which if persistent could reduce the need for further\nmonetary policy tightening. It also reinforces her view that we are very near or perhaps at the peak of this\ntightening cycle.\n5. Collins’ travels around New England have given her insight into its strengths and challenges and\nshown her again how important community banks are to regional economic health.\nShared concerns include childcare, housing, and infrastructure. At the same time, the region benefits from\nits collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and relatively high job opportunity. Collins says\nthe region’s banking industry plays an essential role everywhere, serving communities of all sizes and\nproviding households and businesses with the funding they need for economic health and growth.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. I’m delighted to join you today, for the 22nd Annual Regional &\nCommunity Bankers Conference. I’d like to thank the team here at the Boston Fed – including\nthe Supervision, Regulation & Credit group, and our New England Public Policy Center – for\ntheir contributions to this year’s conference.\nAnd I’d like to thank all of you for attending. It’s wonderful to have banking-sector\nmembers from all parts of New England here today. In my visits to each New England state, to\nlearn from a range of stakeholders, I hear from workers, entrepreneurs, small businesses, local\nemployers, bankers, community development experts, civic leaders, and many others. It’s clear\nfrom those conversations that regional and community banks are a crucial, valued element of\nthe financial and economic infrastructure of the region.\nAnd we appreciate your constructive engagement with us at the Boston Fed. It takes all\nof us to support a safe and sound banking system, which is so essential to a vibrant and\ninclusive economy.\nIn our time today, I’ll provide some remarks before sitting down for a discussion with my\ncolleague Mike Ravid from the Fed’s regional and community supervisory team. For the most\npart, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary policy. I will also provide\nsome perspectives on banking, and talk briefly about the Fed’s work across the region and in\npayments innovation.\nBefore I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own views. I’m not\nspeaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of\nGovernors.\nThe Economic Outlook & Monetary Policy\nI’ll start with the economy, and highlight the impact of some of the recent data on my\nviews about the outlook and appropriate monetary policy – recognizing that some readings have\nbeen a bit surprising, such as the stronger than expected September payroll employment. The\nConsumer Price Index or CPI report for September was released this morning, and I’ll describe\nrecent trends in inflation a bit later in my remarks.\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress, for price stability and\nmaximum sustained employment – and our current focus remains on bringing inflation down to\nour 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time. Price stability is essential for a well1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfunctioning economy, and is an important precondition for maximum employment that is\nsustainable over time. So, reducing inflation relates to both parts of our mandate.\nHigh inflation takes a toll on everyone. As I travel around New England, I continue to\nhear about the challenges people face related to too-high inflation. Households with lower\nincomes are struggling to make ends meet and businesses are grappling with the higher costs\nand added complexity that elevated inflation brings, for planning and investment decisions.\nSo the battle with inflation is important, and in the public interest. As a result, the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates rapidly, relative to prior monetary policy\ntightening cycles, before shifting to a more gradual approach this summer. We have made\nsome progress on inflation, as I’ll discuss, but it is still too high. And given the persistent\nstrength in economic activity, it is too soon to determine whether the slowdown in price growth\nwill continue.\nOverall, I continue to believe that the current phase of policy requires patience, allowing\nus time to review available information holistically, to separate the signal from the noise in the\ndata, and to balance competing risks.\nOutlook\nA few weeks ago, the FOMC released its Summary of Economic projections or SEP,\nreflecting the outlook of participants (the Fed Governors and Reserve Bank presidents). 1 The\nmedian SEP forecast is for inflation to near our target by 2025-26, as still-hot labor market\nconditions normalize. Further, the median forecast sees the appropriate monetary policy to\nachieve such an outcome involving an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds\nrate this year, and then holding rates in restrictive territory for an extended period.\nThis outlook in the SEP remains similar to my own. I believe we may be at, or very near,\nthe peak for this cycle, although I would not take further tightening off the table yet. And looking\nbeyond the “how high” discussion to focus on the “how long” part of this tightening cycle, I will\nsay I expect rates may have to stay higher for longer than previous SEP forecasts had\nsuggested.\nLet me add that I continue to be a “realistic optimist,” and I think that perspective is\nimportant to emphasize. I’m realistic about the uncertainties and risks to my baseline outlook.\n\n1\n\nSummary of Economic Projections, September 20, 2023 (federalreserve.gov)\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nBut I am optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity, and\nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate to cool the mismatch in labor demand and\nsupply.\nProgress Realigning Demand and Supply\nAs you know, recent reports on real economic activity have been strong, and overall\ndemand remains resilient. Payroll growth jumped in September, with upward revisions to job\ngains for July and August. And although the average pace of job gains has slowed this year\nrelative to 2022, it remains well above trend.\nSince demand outstripping supply in the labor markets has been a key factor driving\nwage pressures, and hence price pressures, some further rebalancing will be required for the\ndeceleration we have seen in inflation to be sustained. With rates in restrictive territory, I do\nexpect that payroll growth and economic activity more generally will slow in the coming months.\nThere is already some evidence of demand and supply realigning in the labor market,\neven though it remains strong overall, with unemployment still near historic lows. On the\ndemand side, the previously very high voluntary quit rate has fallen to pre-pandemic levels. Job\nvacancies have also been trending down overall, and are a good bit below their peak – though\nthey remain elevated, and posted a surprising increase in August.\nWe are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply. Labor force\nparticipation has increased, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25 to 54), and since\nthe second half of 2022, there has been a noticeable pickup in employment of foreign-born\nworkers, helping to alleviate labor shortages in some areas.\nAnd importantly, despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings growth\ncontinued to slow through September — especially on a 3-month annualized basis. This is\nconsistent with increased supply helping to alleviate some of the wage pressures. These\ndevelopments are promising, but to be sure demand and supply are coming into better\nalignment, we will need to see the recent labor market trends continue and broaden, including a\nmoderation of hiring to a near-trend pace. This would be evidence of the sustained cooling in\nthe labor markets needed to bring inflation to 2 percent in a reasonable amount of time.\nIn addition, strong job growth and the overall tight labor market continue to support\nconsumption, which was quite solid in July and August. High frequency data suggest spending\n\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmay have slowed in September, but we will have to see whether this is borne out in the official\nretail sales release next week.\nIndeed, household expenditures have remained remarkably resilient to date, even in the\nface of tighter financial conditions. This continued strength is also likely due in part to healthy\nhousehold balance sheets from savings accumulated during the pandemic. These stockpiles\nare diminishing, but recent data revisions suggest the possibility of somewhat higher remaining\nexcess saving than previously thought – which could support household spending a bit longer,\ngoing forward. Still, we are seeing some signs of consumers becoming more financially\nconstrained as credit usage is rising and delinquency rates are increasing. So faced with high\ninterest rates, it is unlikely that consumption will remain as resilient going forward.\nInflation\nTurning to inflation, I will focus on the core measure, which excludes the important but\nvolatile food and energy components, since it is typically a better gauge of underlying trends\nthan total inflation. Core inflation, whether measured by the CPI or the PCE price index, has\nmoderated but a key question is whether the recent progress will be sustained. Today’s CPI\nrelease is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time.\nDisaggregating the key components of this measure provides valuable insight into the\ndrivers of recent movements. Much of the positive news comes from declines in core goods\nprice inflation, helped by the improvement in supply conditions. But firms’ incentives to pass the\ncosts savings from supply chain improvements through to prices may be short-lived, unless\ndemand slows.\nHousing or shelter inflation is moderating overall, but the September pickup in CPI\nshelter inflation – driven in part by the volatile “lodging away from home” category – highlights\nthat progress may prove uneven. In particular, we will have to see whether the recent pickup in\nhouse price growth will put further pressure on new rents, slowing the deceleration in measured\ninflation in this sector.\nThat brings me to core services excluding housing, which accounts for a significant\nportion of the consumption basket. Inflation for this component remains elevated and overall\nprogress has been limited. Bringing core non-housing services inflation down will likely require\nlabor market conditions to cool more, as labor accounts for a large share of costs in this sector.\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOverall, it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to\nthe 2 percent target we associate with price stability. I’ll also note that it is important not to read\ntoo much into individual data points, or even from a few months of information. The monthly\ninflation data, for example, have always been noisy. But the variability of core inflation has\nincreased since the pandemic. Extracting underlying patterns from noisy incoming data will take\nsome time.\nPandemic Uncertainties\nI’ll say that the mixed signals we are getting from the recent data highlight the need to\nfocus on trends and take a holistic approach to interpreting incoming information and\ndetermining the implications for appropriate policy. Here I will highlight that the economic\ncircumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, highly\nunusual.\nYesterday I spoke at length at Wellesley College about the role of uncertainty in\npolicymaking, notably after an episode like the pandemic. 2 While the nature of the uncertainty\nhas evolved, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty about economic indicators, including\naround underlying inflation conditions and employment growth.\nAs a result, this phase of policy requires considerable patience. Policymakers need time\nto draw correct conclusions from the incoming data and to allow some special factors that have\nbeen supporting near-term activity – and perhaps limiting the impact of higher interest rates on\nthe economy – to play out. This includes households’ excess savings that I mentioned earlier,\nas well as firms’ elevated cash holdings and debt previously refinanced at low rates. As\nconsumers’ savings and firms’ cash holdings decline further, and more corporate debt needs to\nbe refinanced, tight credit conditions should act to restrain activity. We will need to continue\nmonitoring these trends carefully.\nSince it is likely that we have yet to see the full effects of our past policy actions,\npatience is also needed in order to best weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high\nagainst the risk of activity slowing more than expected. I recognize that higher short-term rates\nmay place additional pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision\n\nReflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty – 2023 Goldman Lecture at Wellesley\nCollege.\n2\n\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmore than anticipated. I’ll also note that, before the FOMC meeting at the end of this month, we\nwill receive additional, important data on inflation and real activity that will help me, and the\ncommittee, in making an informed policy decision.\nLonger-Term Rates\nFinally, as we consider appropriate policy, it is important to take movements in long-term\ninterest rates into account. Since mid-September, the 10-year Treasury yield has moved up\nnoticeably, though it retreated a bit this week. However, on net, this yield is now somewhat\nhigher, as are corporate bond yields and mortgage rates. Several factors may be driving these\noverall gains in long-term yields, and it will be important to see whether the increase is\nsustained, especially given the rate volatility in recent days.\nImportantly, the rise in long-term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions. If\nit persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. This\nreinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak federal funds rates for this\ntightening cycle.\nIn sum, I believe the current phase of the monetary policy requires patience and a\nholistic assessment of available data, while we stay the course to restore price stability. I\nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see evidence that\ninflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\nPatience will give us time to carefully separate signal from noise as we assess the\nincoming data. It will also allow us to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to\nwork through the economy.\nNew England’s Economy and Banking Sector\nI’ll now turn from the national economy to the regional economy, building from my\ncolleague Jeff Thompson’s remarks earlier today. In my travels around New England, I’ve\nlearned about unique challenges and economic strengths, as well as common threads that exist\nacross much of the region. The challenges I hear about that prevent people from participating\nin the economy or the workforce include real economic issues like childcare, housing, and\ninfrastructure such as transportation and broadband. In addition, pockets of the region face\npersistent social and economic challenges. Those gaps for people and places are essential to\nrecognize, and can be hidden by overall aggregates that are quite favorable.\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI also hear about and see New England’s many economic strengths. Among them: the\nregion’s collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and an ecosystem of innovation.\nNew England is home to world-class institutions and organizations in many fields. Additionally,\nwe are fortunate that job opportunities have historically been plentiful in this region – though\nwith some variation by area.\nAnother strength is the region’s unique regional and community banking industry. Your\nbanks serve households and businesses in communities large and small. Of course, banks\nface challenges apart from those linked to the current interest rate environment. Evolving\ncustomer preferences require increasing investment in technology, and you’re seeing increased\nmargin pressure related to competition for deposits and competition from new market entrants.\nI want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating vibrant,\ninclusive economies. Community banks have remained resilient as they continue to leverage\nthe close working relationships they have within smaller cities, towns, and rural areas.\nCommunity banks provide critical sources of funding for small businesses. This was\ndemonstrated, for example, when the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program was\nimplemented, and community banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached\nbusinesses.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, along\nwith effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps ensure that banks of all sizes can\nmeet the needs of households and businesses in every community, in good times and bad. I\nfully agree that we must preserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.\nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region\nAs I conclude, I’ll say just a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our\noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for\neveryone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions, so the Fed has a broad\nportfolio of activities and engagements, all in the public interest. It includes monetary\npolicymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, financial stability work, and\nserving as lender of last resort for banks. We’re also involved in community and economic\ndevelopment activities and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and\nfinance. All of it supports our mission and our mandate.\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI’ll briefly mention some of our work to expand opportunities throughout New England so\nthat everyone can participate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging\nlocal efforts to bring economic revitalization to smaller cities and rural areas that have faced\nlong-term struggles. We call this initiative “Working Places.” Our approach is based on\nresearch that shows that an essential element of place-based economic resilience is\ncollaboration among local individuals from different sectors who are willing to share leadership.\nIn nine years, Working Places has expanded to 30 communities in five New England states.\nThe Fed’s work helps local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. Communities\nparticipating in Working Places report solving problems, making changes that create\nopportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and partners to shape progress. Local teams\ndevelop goals and strategies in areas including workforce development, poverty reduction,\naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. Local, tangible efforts like these\nare adding up to real strength in our region.\nAdditionally, I’d like to mention the Fed’s work in payments innovation. Since its\nfounding, the Federal Reserve has played a role in ensuring the country’s payments\ninfrastructure can effectively meet the public’s needs. We demonstrate this commitment\nthrough continuous improvements to our financial services, and by taking accountability for safe,\naccessible, and efficient payments. As everyone in this room knows, the U.S. payments system\n– the way consumers, workers, and employers make and receive payments – has evolved\nmightily over time. Not that long ago, the Fed was helping move checks around the country.\nBut we worked with the banking industry to digitize check clearing, and create other automated\nchannels. In July, the Fed launched the FedNow® Service, a new payments “rail” to make\ninstant payments secure and convenient. FedNow enables instant payments to be processed\nat any time of day, on any day of the year, for a broad array of transactions. The FedNow\nService is core payments infrastructure available to all depository institutions.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I’ll note that since its inception 110 years ago, and by design, the U.S.\ncentral bank has deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers. These range from\npreserving safety and soundness, to managing and improving payments infrastructure, to\npromoting access to credit that facilitates economic progress. I look forward to continuing to\n8\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwork together to support the people and places of New England – and the nation – with a\nvibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.\nWith that, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to sitting\ndown with Mike for some questions.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nOctober 11, 2023\nWellesley, Massachusetts\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins highlighted three main forms of uncertainty that monetary policymakers confront, all present in the\npandemic era. The first relates to data and measurement – how accurately statistics describe the variables they\nintend to measure. The second relates to relationships between key economic variables that influence policy\ndecisions – examples include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics. The third is related to\nunforeseen events, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical developments.\n2. For policymaking, the appropriate response to uncertainty depends on its type as well as the context.\nUncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly – or to take a more wait-and-see approach. In the current\npolicy cycle, this has contributed to different policy phases, starting with a period of holding rates low when pandemicrelated risks were still high, followed by a period of aggressive moves, and then the current more gradual, patient\napproach to policy.\n3. Some special factors have impacted the pandemic recovery that make it difficult to compare to previous\nbusiness cycles, adding to the uncertainty. Despite many expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained\nremarkably resilient to date. Household balance sheets have been solid, partially due to savings accumulated during\nthe pandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated due in part to locking in financing at previously low\nrates. Factors like these have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles, to\ndate.\n4. With progress on inflation and continued elevated uncertainty, the FOMC appropriately shifted to a new,\nmore gradual and “patient” policymaking phase. Though inflation levels are still too high, taking the time to\nholistically assess incoming information is warranted. It reflects the fact that we are likely close to the peak of this\ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely balanced with the risk of slowing\nactivity more than needed to achieve price stability. Still, Collins expects we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels\nuntil we see evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\n5. Collins remains realistic, but optimistic, about restoring price stability without a significant economic\ndownturn. Overall, she continues to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price\nstability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate –\nan outcome consistent with both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n6. One key policy lesson, Collins suggests with the benefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply\nshocks. The pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers; and risk assessments, however difficult to\nmake, had to be made. But Collins observes that the risk of widespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a\nstronger case than previously realized for insuring against too-high inflation by removing policy accommodation more\nquickly.\n7. Collins also offered some takeaways to students about learning and careers. She recommended a mindset\nof lifelong learning and seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives. In working environments,\nshe also underlined the importance of gathering information broadly – quantitative and qualitative – and intentionally\nhearing from a wide range of stakeholders, including voices that have not traditionally been “in the room.”\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThank you for inviting me to be with you today. It is such a pleasure to be on the\nWellesley campus with students, faculty, and community members.\nBefore my remarks, there are a few people I would like to acknowledge. First,\nthe late Marshall Goldman, whose legacy of insightful inquiry is rightly commemorated\nwith this annual lecture. Second, the Wellesley economics department and your chair,\nCourtney Coile, for the invitation to deliver this year’s Goldman lecture. Over the years,\nmembers of Wellesley’s economics faculty have had many substantive connections with\nme and also with the Federal Reserve System, and I want to express my appreciation\nfor your commitment to excellence, your intellectual curiosity, and your dedication to\nyour students. I really must commend Wellesley as a whole, and certainly the\neconomics department, for sending into the world thoughtful, prepared, and very able\nwomen who have made an impact in so many fields – not least, in economics and\nfinance.\nLast but certainly not least, I want to acknowledge your president, Paula\nJohnson, and thank her for her leadership and, on a personal level, her friendship.\nPaula and I got to know each other as undergraduates – a few miles from here, and a\nfew years ago – and it has been so wonderful to see her many distinguished\ncontributions to society in the years since then, during her remarkable career in\nmedicine, public health, and higher education.\nBrief Context\nAllow me to preview what I’d like to cover today. As you know, I’ve come to\nWellesley to speak about my role, and the Fed’s responsibilities, in making policy – in\nparticular, amidst uncertainty, and with a focus on the different phases of monetary\npolicy during the pandemic.\nI’ll start with a bit of context, to level set about the Fed’s policymaking and other\nroles. Then I’ll turn to monetary policy and explore the important matter of uncertainty in\npolicymaking through the lens of the recent pandemic and ongoing economic recovery.\nI’ll discuss the evolution of the economy over this period and the corresponding phases\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof policy – bringing the essential element of time and changing conditions into the\nanalysis. I’ll conclude with some very brief connections to thinking about careers in\neconomics and policymaking.\nOf course, I offer my standard disclaimer – these comments are my own, and\nmay not reflect the views of any other Federal Reserve policy maker.\nSo first let me set the stage with a bit of context, in particular for the students who\nare learning about macroeconomics and the role of the central bank. Created by\nCongress nearly 110 years ago, and refined over time, the Fed’s duties support the\nfunctioning of the U.S. economy, in the public interest. We do a variety of things,\nstarting with monetary policy. For me and my colleagues at the Boston Fed, the\noverarching vision is a vibrant economy that works for all. I see our mission as serving\nthe public in New England and the nation by promoting a strong, resilient, and inclusive\neconomy and financial system.\nBeyond monetary policy, we have other duties – which I won’t have time to\ndiscuss today. They include 1:\n\n\nsupporting the safety and soundness of the nation’s financial institutions, by\nsupervising some of the country’s banks and serving as a “lender of last resort”\nto the financial system;\n\n\n\nmitigating financial stability risks;\n\n\n\nsupporting safe and reliable payment and settlement systems – back-end\ninfrastructure and services to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury (ranging\nfrom currency and coin circulation to various electronic channels); and\n\n\n\npromoting community economic development in a variety of ways.\nMost of my remarks today will be about our monetary policymaking, but I’d like to\n\ntake a moment, with many economics students and professors in the audience, to\nhighlight the variety of research we do – which is wide-ranging, because the economy is\n\nLearn more in “The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does,” a publication of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nso multifaceted. Our economists and their research assistants and analysts do\nfascinating, data-driven, nonpartisan, policy-relevant work, and I’ll mention just two (of\nmany!) recent examples. Some of our researchers have studied the attention – or\ninattention – that consumers give to inflation, demonstrating that the absolute level of\ninflation is important. When inflation is low and stable, consumers don’t really think\nabout it; but when inflation is higher, consumers are much more aware of it, and\npossibly more likely to change their behavior. 2 Another recent study looked at the\npotential causes of racial wealth gaps and found that inheritances and other types of\nwealth transfers from one generation to the next play only a small part – the main\ncontributors to the gap, the authors find, are differences in lifetime earnings and pension\nassets. Therefore, policies that successfully increase human capital can potentially help\nreduce this gap. 3, 4\nMonetary Policy\nLet’s turn to monetary policy, and the core of my talk today. It’s important to note\nthat at the Fed we are entrusted with monetary, and not fiscal, policy. This involves\nactions that ultimately affect the cost of borrowing for businesses and households.\nThe Fed spends a lot of time analyzing economic conditions – using data, doing\nresearch, and listening to stakeholders locally and nationally. Having prepared in great\ndepth, I join the other 11 regional Reserve Bank presidents and the seven members of\nthe Board of Governors in Washington eight times a year to discuss appropriate\nmonetary policy. After taking in substantive staff analysis, and multiple go-arounds by\ncommittee participants, there is a vote on policy actions by the current voting members,\nsome of whom rotate year-to-year. The committee’s decision and summary of\nappropriate policy is released in a statement, and then the Chair holds a press\n\nSee Bracha and Tang (2022).\nSee Sabelhaus and Thompson (2022).\n4 Additionally, the Boston Fed, in collaboration with a coalition of community partners, is launching a\nmultiyear research initiative to explore wealth disparities across Massachusetts. Our findings intend to\ninform policy and will hopefully be used by public, private, and non-profit organizations to develop\nstrategies that promote equity in wealth, a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.\n2\n3\n\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconference to explain the committee’s decisions, which are then implemented in the\nmarket.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged, by Congress, with a “dual mandate” of price\nstability and maximum employment. We currently define price stability as 2 percent\ninflation – a low level, where consumers and businesses do not see eroding purchasing\npower as a pressing concern. 5 Maximum employment, the other pillar of the dual\nmandate, is less specifically defined, but refers to the broad and inclusive goal of job\nopportunities for all Americans. It's important to note that while often characterized as\ncompeting, history has shown that price stability is essential for a well-functioning\neconomy, and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable\nover time.\nFigure 1’s left panel shows the evolution of the inflation rate since the 1960s,\nwith grey bars indicating recessions. 6 While there are many inflation measures, I focus\nhere on the 12-month change in the price of personal consumption expenditures (or\nPCE), excluding the important but volatile food and energy components – also known\nas “core” inflation 7 and generally a good predictor of overall inflation’s path.\nAs the figure shows, achieving price stability hasn’t always been an easy task\nover this period. An inflationary buildup started in the mid-1960s and persisted until the\ndisinflation achieved under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s. This was\nfollowed by an extended period of inflation moderation, with inflation typically near or\nbelow 2 percent since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, lasting until the\nrecent pandemic-related inflation flare-up.\n\nWhile this argument holds even more strongly for a zero-inflation rate, one reason to target a positive\nbut low inflation rate is that it can be difficult for firms to cut wages. A positive inflation rate helps to\nachieve real wage declines that facilitate adjustment when the economy faces a contractionary shock,\nthus alleviating the downward nominal wage rigidity constraint. For additional context see Bewley (1999).\n6 See U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions, produced by the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch.\n7 While this measure can be a better indicator of underlying inflation trends, the Fed’s inflation target is\nexpressed in terms of total PCE inflation. Salwati and Wessel (2021) is a helpful summary of different\ninflation measures.\n5\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 1’s right panel shows the unemployment rate along with inflation, further\nillustrating the challenges monetary policymakers face in trying to stabilize economic\nactivity at a level consistent with both aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate. 8\nBy raising or lowering interest rates, monetary policy affects aggregate demand\nin the economy – and Figure 2 shows how the stance of policy has evolved over time.\nPolicy tightening – an increase in the Fed’s policy rate, the federal funds rate – raises\nthe cost of borrowing for firms and households, with the effect of slowing demand for\ncapital, labor, goods, and services, which in turn relieves price pressures, tempering\ninflation. Conversely, lowering the federal funds rate, or easing policy, reduces the cost\nof borrowing, thus supporting an expansion of aggregate demand and employment.\nThis tends to increase price pressures, raising inflation. 9\nIt is important to note that many of the deviations of inflation and unemployment\nfrom levels consistent with price stability and full employment have resulted from\nunanticipated events requiring the Fed to react. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime\nexample – a shock originating outside of the economic system and resulting in a\nsubstantial disruption to the economy, requiring a response from the Fed in pursuit of its\ndual mandate.\nSo, I will now offer some reflections on conducting monetary policy during a time\nof heightened uncertainty stemming from the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19\npandemic. I will note that, while a keen observer of monetary policy for many years, I\nwas not involved in policy decisions until joining the Boston Fed in July of 2022.\nA key takeaway for me is that the elevated uncertainty, and the risk management\nconsiderations associated with that uncertainty, played an important role in policy\nsetting since the pandemic began, and appropriately so. I see the most salient types of\n\n8 Fed actions typically are not intended to cause a recession, possibly with the exception of the Volker\ndisinflation. The Fed’s limited ability at times to stabilize the economy could be due to events that are\nbeyond the control of monetary policy. For further reflections on these topics see Blinder (2023).\n9 The Fed can also affect interest rates through instruments other than its policy rate, such as by buying\nor selling government-backed securities. These so-called large-scale asset purchases have occurred at\ntimes when the federal funds rate hit the zero-lower-bound. The Fed also provides information about\nfuture policy (so-called forward guidance) with its meeting statement and quarterly Summary of Economic\nProjections.\n\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nuncertainty as having shifted, with somewhat different policy implications, as the\nsituation evolved – and will explore that with you today.\nOf course, with the benefit of hindsight, some may argue that different policy\ndecisions would have been preferable. However, I think it is too soon to judge how well\nthe Fed has managed the challenges of stabilizing the economy during this very\ncomplex period. We will have much to learn from the in-depth analysis that this period\nwarrants. And much will depend on whether inflation returns to target in a reasonable\namount of time with only modest effects on employment.\nI will highlight that I remain a “realistic optimist,” based on my assessment of\ncurrently available information. The ongoing resilience I see in the economy, and the\nprogress on inflation so far, lead me to believe there is a pathway to achieving this\ndesirable outcome. In fact, that path seems to have widened recently – although\nconsiderable risks remain.\nUncertainty and Monetary Policy\nFormer Fed chairman Alan Greenspan once noted that uncertainty is not just a\n“pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of\nthat landscape.” 10 So, I’ll next highlight three main forms of uncertainty that monetary\npolicymakers must confront. 11\nThe first is uncertainty related to data and measurement. This refers to how\naccurately available statistical data describe the variables they intend to measure, and\nto the fact that some variables are not directly observable. Two examples are maximum\nsustainable employment, and the underlying “neutral” interest rate, above which policy\nbecomes restrictive (or below which policy becomes accommodative). Both are\nimportant economic concepts that are certainly affected by uncertainty.\n\nSee Greenspan (2004).\nAccessible and thoughtful discussions about the different forms of uncertainty and how they affect the\nconduct of monetary policy can be found in, for example, Bernanke (2004) and Mendes et al (2017).\n10\n11\n\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe second form is uncertainty related to the relationships between key\neconomic variables that influence policy decisions. Examples of this type, in the current\ncontext, include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics, and the\nsize and timing of the effects of monetary policy – the proverbial “long and variable lags”\nwith which policy exerts its effects on the economy.\nThe third form is uncertainty related to unforeseen events, such as pandemics,\nnatural disasters, or geopolitical developments. While statistical methods can use past\nexperiences to help quantify the first two types of uncertainty, these types of shocks\nresist prediction.\nFor policymaking, the appropriate response to increased uncertainty depends on\nits type as well as the context. 12 In many situations, uncertainty calls for a gradual and\ncautious approach to policy. This can arise in periods of increased uncertainty about\nthe data, or the effects of policy actions on the economy. Allowing time for the “signal”\nto emerge from the “noise” in the data, or to fully assess the economy’s response to\npast policy actions, can help – leading to more informed policy decisions, and balancing\nthe risks of doing too much versus not doing enough.\nHowever, in some circumstances, uncertainty calls for policy to move\naggressively. Examples often involve contexts where doing nothing or moving too\nslowly exacerbates the economic circumstances that policymakers are trying to\naddress. For instance, too-small or too-slow actions to make monetary policy more\naccommodative at the outset of a major crisis could lead to severe labor market\ndisplacements that persistently lower employment, with significant pain for many. On\nthe flip side, when there are risks of higher inflation expectations becoming entrenched,\na gradual inflation-fighting approach may limit policymakers’ ability to restore price\nstability without a significant downturn. 13\n\nSee Brainard (1967).\nFor further discussions on this topic see, for example, Ball (1999), Friedman (1968 and 1977) and\nPhelps (1967).\n12\n13\n\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was uncharted territory along all these dimensions of\nuncertainty, due to the size and speed of the economic disruptions it induced. Figure 3\nplots the severity of the pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and deaths. This\nunforeseen public health event quickly moved the world to an economic situation unlike\nany in the post-World War II period, with policymakers trying to decipher whether the\nusual rules governing the behavior of the economy still applied. The pandemic also\naffected segments of the economy very unevenly, and in non-standard ways relative to\nprevious economic crises, making it more difficult to interpret incoming data and assess\nthe effects of monetary policy on the economy. And as time passed and the economy\nevolved, so did the nature of the pandemic-induced uncertainty.\nThe nuances in how uncertainty influences policy decisions contributed to distinct\nphases of monetary policy, which I will now discuss in more detail.\nBackground: The economy before early 2020\nTo set the stage, I suspect it is helpful to highlight some key features of the prepandemic economy.\nOverall, in early 2020 the economy was doing quite well, as can be seen earlier\nin Figure 1B. Despite an unemployment rate that had fallen to near 50-year lows, core\ninflation remained below the Fed’s 2 percent target. 14 Absent clear indications of\ninflationary pressures, the Fed was not actively restricting economic growth.\nImportantly, this monetary policy strategy of letting the labor market “run hot” with\ninflation still below target was successfully drawing more people into the labor market,\nbenefiting groups that traditionally endured higher than average unemployment rates,\nand fostering a broader-based and more inclusive notion of maximum employment.\n\nWage inflation was rising some but still relatively subdued. It is possible that, given more time, wage\nand price pressures would have picked up. Still, these pressures were potentially limited because output\ngrowth was moderate and relatively stable.\n14\n\n8\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCOVID-19 [March 2020 to November 2020]\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and almost overnight much of\nthe U.S. (and global) economy shut down. Economic activity plummeted, and by April\n2020, the unemployment rate had spiked to 14.7 percent – an extraordinary jump in\nspeed and magnitude.\nIn addition to enormous public health uncertainty, the COVID-19 shock created\nunprecedented uncertainty about the extent and length of the economic shutdown. It\nwas unclear how consumers and firms would react to social distancing requirements,\nand limits on mobility. Concerns also emerged about an extended period of depressed\neconomic activity, and with that, the possibility of falling prices potentially resulting in a\ndeflationary spiral. And there were worries about very high unemployment leaving a\nmore permanent labor market imprint, despite the hope that many of the layoffs would\nbe temporary.\nThe pandemic also laid bare and exacerbated labor market inequalities, as\nlower-paid, customer-facing occupations were affected the most by the shutdowns while\nmany of the higher-paying occupations could be performed remotely. The left panel of\nFigure 4 shows the disparities in unemployment by race, and the right panel by\neducational attainment. Separately, closures of schools and daycares forced some\nindividuals – especially women – who could not work from home to drop out of the labor\nforce at least temporarily.\nSo the situation involved considerable uncertainty about the possible extent of\nthe economic damage brought on by the pandemic, and the potential for significant\nnegative feedback loops. This called for large and decisive monetary and fiscal policy\nactions to avoid a worst-case scenario. 15 The Fed cut its policy rate to essentially zero,\n\n15 A description of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\ncan be found, for example, in Romer (2021), and Milstein and Wessel (2021). See also Alicia Parlapiano,\nDeborah B. Solomon, Madeleine Ngo, and Stacy Cowley, “Where $5 Trillion in Pandemic Stimulus Money\nWent,” New York Times, March 11, 2022.\n\n.\n9\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand provided forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, indicating that rates\nwould remain near zero until the achievement of certain economic conditions. 16 The\nFed also launched an array of programs to support the flow of credit to businesses,\nhouseholds, and state and local governments. 17 The Fed gathered additional sources\nof information 18 as well, in an effort to reduce uncertainty and better understand the\nextremely unusual economic developments.\nElected officials provided extraordinary fiscal assistance to the economy, and its\neffects are still reverberating. The extent of the support to households, for example, is\ncaptured in the large rise of disposable income above pre-pandemic trends, as shown in\nFigure 5 – something that had never occurred to such an extent in previous downturns.\nThe timeliness and magnitude of these fiscal and monetary policy measures\nultimately succeeded in preventing the most-feared economic risks from materializing.\nThe unemployment rate dropped rapidly, and inflation did not decline much from its low,\npre-pandemic level. Of course, containing the virus and the swift development of\nvaccines were crucial to avoiding a broader crisis.\nThe reopening of the economy and the inflation surprise [Dec. 2020 to Nov. 2021]\nAfter the acute phase of the pandemic, there was a noticeable rebound in GDP\nand its largest component – personal consumption expenditures – in the second half of\n2020. This is shown in Figure 6, where both series are plotted relative to an estimate of\nlong-run trend.\n\nInitially, the guidance in the FOMC statement affirmed that rates would stay near zero until\npolicymakers were “confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve\nits maximum employment and price stability goals.” In September 2020, guidance was strengthened to\nindicate that rates would stay low until “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to\nmoderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”\n17 In addition, the Fed resumed purchases of Treasuries and government guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, first to restore market functioning and later to support the economy with low interest rates\nacross the maturity spectrum.\n18 For an overview of these sources see Cajner et al (2022).\n16\n\n10\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, despite this progress, there were worries heading into 2021 that\neconomic activity could stall. The real-world effectiveness of vaccines, which first\nbecame available in December 2020, was still uncertain. Another wave of the virus was\nunderway. And so consumers’ willingness to resume normal activities was quite\nunclear.\nAmidst this backdrop of continued high uncertainty, monetary policy remained\nhighly accommodative, even as inflation started to pick up in the spring of 2021, as\nshown in the lighter line in Figure 7. At the time, the rise in inflation was believed to be\nmainly tied to supply chain constraints that would resolve quickly. Expectations of\nfuture price increases remained low 19, reinforcing the idea that inflation could rise\ntemporarily without leaving a persistent imprint on the economy. And although the\nunemployment rate had improved considerably, it was still around 6 percent in the first\nhalf of 2021, above levels considered consistent with full employment. This state of\naffairs did not suggest an immediate need to remove monetary policy accommodation\nand tighten financial conditions.\nIn such a context of heightened uncertainty, it is crucial to assess the costs\nassociated with each risk to the economic outlook and devise the best strategy to\nachieve the Fed’s dual mandate goals. And in the early stages of the pandemic\nrecovery, given the still uncertain public health situation, risks of demand setbacks\noutweighed the risks of inflation.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, one could argue for removing policy\naccommodation sooner. 20 But to me at the time, given the continued significant\n\nAfter dropping sharply with the start of the pandemic, market-based inflation expectations rose through\nmuch of 2020 and into 2021, but by mid-2021 had risen enough to only equal their long-run average.\nShort-term survey-based expectations measures, while up a bit in early 2021, did not rise sharply until\nMay and longer-term survey-based measures edged higher but remained in a fairly narrow range.\n20 Chair Powell commented at the March 2022 FOMC press conference: \"…if we knew now that these\nsupply blockages [and] the inflation resulting from them, in collision with … very strong demand, if we\nknew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to\nmove earlier.\"\n19\n\n11\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nuncertainty, it seemed prudent for the Fed to support the economy versus pre-empting\nan inflation surge that few were forecasting. 21\nUltimately, the economy evolved quite differently than anticipated. In particular,\ndemand exceeded expectations, while supply fell short, resulting in a large demandsupply gap that fueled inflation. By early 2021, GDP and consumption were already\nabove trend (see Figure 6) and subsequent waves of the virus did little to slow demand,\nwhich was unusually tilted toward consumption of goods, and away from services.\nHowever, supply-chain constraints persisted as highlighted by the New York Fed\nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index in Figure 8. While efforts were underway to\nunderstand the supply bottlenecks, including development of new indicators like the\nNew York Fed index, it proved very difficult to assess the extent and duration of supply\nchallenges emanating from an atypical pandemic shock in real time. Russia’s war in\nUkraine in early 2022 was yet another unanticipated event, adding to supply-chain\npressures and firms’ costs.\nImportantly, there was also the expectation that, as the economy reopened more\nfully, spending would shift from goods (which people could consume while sheltering at\nhome) back to services, and ease price pressures for goods. And given the expectation\nthat supply in the service sector could sufficiently meet demand, service-sector inflation\nwas not expected to rise significantly.\nAgain, reality was different. Households had accumulated substantial savings\nduring the early stages of the pandemic, thanks to the fiscal support and limited\nopportunities to spend. So services consumption rose, but without a material decline in\ngoods consumption. Thus, there was little relief from supply chain bottlenecks. And,\nmost crucially, labor supply did not rise as anticipated to meet service sector demand. 22\n\n21\n\nSee Collins (2023).\n\nThe labor force participation rate collapsed when businesses shut down early in the pandemic. As firms\nreopened, the participation rate retraced some of its initial decline, but many workers stayed on the\nsidelines due to several factors, including fears of contracting COVID-19, childcare problems and extra\nsavings built up during the pandemic. Participation was also held down by lower immigration (Peri and\nZaiour 2022). Participation began to recover more robustly in the fall of 2021, the same time that the\n22\n\n12\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThis led to a noticeable pickup in labor costs and services inflation. Given that services\nare a significant portion of the consumption basket, inflation became very broad based.\nMonetary policy tightening [December 2021 to May 2023]\nWith broad-based wage and price pressures by late 2021, it was increasingly\nclear that elevated inflation would be more persistent than initially thought.\nPolicymakers therefore began the process of removing monetary accommodation in\nhopes of slowing economic activity and bringing demand into better balance with\nsupply. 23\nIn March 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nFinancial conditions had already started to tighten — especially in the mortgage market\n— owing in part to the Fed’s statements about its policy direction, or forward guidance.\nAfter March, policy rate increases were swift, with a 50 basis points hike in May,\nand then 75 basis points at the four subsequent meetings, followed by another 50 basis\npoints increase (see Figure 7). By the end of 2022, the FOMC had raised rates\ncumulatively by 425 basis points—a very rapid pace, relative to the other tightening\ncycles that have occurred since the Volcker disinflation 40 years ago.\nPolicymakers judged that high, unexpectedly persistent inflation, combined with a\ntight labor market, required rapid policy rate adjustments to fulfill the Fed’s mandate.\nRates were increased an additional 25 basis points at each of the next three meetings,\nto over 5 percent in May of this year.\nI will note that high inflation takes a toll on all of us. In my travels around New\nEngland, I’ve heard repeatedly about the challenges households face from rapid price\n\nshare of foreign-born workers in the working-age population began to increase. As of August 2023,\nparticipation had increased by about one percentage point relative to August 2021, despite the\nlongstanding downward trend in participation caused by population aging (Cooper et al. 2021).\n23 In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC announced it was slowing the pace of long-term asset\npurchases and signaled that the end of such purchases was near. The Summary of Economic Projections\nthat accompanied this statement also showed an upward shift in policymakers’ expectations for the path\nof the federal funds rate over the next year. The process of reducing asset holdings (so-called\nquantitative tightening) commenced in March 2022.\n13\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nincreases, particularly those with lower incomes struggling to make ends meet. Inflation\nis challenging as well for businesses forced to grapple with higher costs and more\ncomplex planning and investment decisions. So this battle against inflation was and is\nimportant, in the public interest.\nUncertainty also played an important role in policy setting as the Fed sought to\ncombat high inflation. By late 2021 and early 2022, the source of uncertainty had\nshifted from implications of the public health situation to uncertainty about key economic\nrelationships – most notably the inflation process. In particular, persistently high levels\nof inflation led to concerns about a possible rise in longer-term inflation expectations,\nwhich had it occurred would likely have made it more difficult for policymakers to restore\nprice stability. This type of uncertainty also argued for aggressive rate increases.\nThe focus on bringing inflation down and containing longer-run inflation\nexpectations in turn created additional uncertainty about the economy’s ability to\nwithstand a rapid tightening of financial conditions. The banking stresses caused by the\ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March 2023 added to this\nconcern, as many expected the banking turmoil to restrict consumer and business credit\nbeyond the typical impact of policy tightening. 24\nDespite many forecasters expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained\nremarkably resilient to date. Indeed, since the beginning of the tightening cycle, the\neconomy has remained in a relatively strong position. Household balance sheets have\nbeen solid, partially due to savings accumulated during the early stages of the\npandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated, due in part to firms’ ability\nto lock in financing at low rates early in the pandemic. These factors have likely made\nthe economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles.\nMore recently, however, there is evidence that firms’ cash holdings are declining,\nand households’ stocks of accumulated excess savings are diminishing. Therefore, the\n\nTo address the banking stress, the Fed in conjunction with the Treasury Department enacted the Bank\nTerm Funding Program (BTFP), which helped relieve banking strains and likely limited additional credit\ncontraction.\n24\n\n14\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nneed for credit is rising. These developments will eventually make demand more\nresponsive to high interest rates.\nThe most recent policy phase, and looking ahead\nWith interest rates firmly in a range that will restrict the economy, we are starting\nto see promising signs of policy having the desired effects.\nIn particular, the darker line in Figure 9 shows that total PCE inflation (which\nincludes the volatile food and energy prices) is down considerably from its peak. Core\nPCE inflation has also moderated some, but has some way to go to return to 2 percent,\nand it is too soon to tell whether recent progress will be sustained.\nDisaggregating core PCE inflation into its three main components, as shown in\nFigure 10, provides valuable insight into the different drivers of inflation. Inflation for\ngoods (the dark blue line) has decreased noticeably with the improvement in supply\nconditions. And as lower market rents are starting to pass through, housing or shelter\ninflation (the lighter blue line) is moderating as well. But core inflation for non-housing\nservices (orange line) remains elevated, and this accounts for over half of core\nconsumption. Bringing this component down will likely require labor market conditions\nto cool more, since labor represents a large share of costs in the services sector.\nWhile the unemployment rate remains near historic lows, there is some evidence\nof demand becoming better aligned with supply in the labor market. Despite the\nSeptember jump in employment, growth in payrolls this year has slowed relative to last\nyear though it is still significantly above trend (see Figure 11). The previously very high\nvoluntary quit rate has fallen to pre-pandemic levels. Lower, though still high, job\nvacancies are also consistent with a gradually cooling labor market. We are also seeing\npromising developments in terms of labor supply as labor force participation has\nincreased, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25 to 54), as also shown in\nFigure 11.\nIn this context, the FOMC shifted to a new, more gradual, policymaking phase\nthis summer – holding rates constant in June and again September, after a 25 basis\npoint hike in July.\n15\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn my view, this transition to a more patient, approach – taking the time to\nholistically assess incoming information – was warranted for a number of reasons. In\nparticular, it reflects the fact that we are likely close to, and possibly at, the peak of this\ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely\nbalanced with the risk of slowing activity more than needed to achieve price stability.\nOnce again, appropriate policy in this phase is importantly influenced by\nuncertainty and related risk assessments. With inflation expectations well anchored, the\nuncertainty now relates more to difficulty assessing the ultimate impact of our policy\nactions to date 25 and to extracting signal from data that are noisier than usual. 26 In\nreviewing incoming economic data, I avoid focusing on individual data points, looking\ninstead for trends that show both sustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the\nunderlying goal of realigning supply and demand.\nPatience will give us time to better separate “signal” from “noise” in the data and\nto balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy.\nI expect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see\nevidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent. And while we are likely\nnear, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted\ndepending on incoming information.\nOverall, I continue to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but\noptimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and\nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate – an outcome consistent with both\nparts of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n\nEstimates of the peak effect of monetary policy on activity and inflation vary considerably in terms of\ntiming and magnitude. For a review see, for example, Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n26 For instance, monthly inflation readings have been more volatile than usual since the beginning of the\npandemic. Consumers’ spending patterns have also changed, creating issues with seasonal adjustment,\nand with inferring the underlying strength of demand.\n25\n\n16\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSome closing policy thoughts\nLooking ahead, there will be many important policy-relevant issues to be studied\nfrom the still-evolving business cycle induced by the pandemic. That said, I hope I have\nconveyed the important role for uncertainty considerations in setting monetary policy.\nThere are different types of uncertainty. And depending on type as well as\ncontext, uncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly – or to take a more\nwait-and-see approach. In the current policy tightening cycle, this has contributed to\ndifferent policy phases, with a period of aggressive moves followed by the current more\ngradual approach to policy.\nThe pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers, and risk\nassessments, however difficult to make, had to be made. One lesson I’ll offer, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply shocks. In particular, the risk of\nwidespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a stronger case than previously\nrealized for insuring against too-high inflation by removing policy accommodation more\nquickly. More generally, I look forward to the extensive research and debate to come,\nas we endeavor to draw additional lessons, deepen understanding and improve policy.\nStill, despite the evolving uncertainties about the economy and appropriate\npolicy, I hope that you, like me, are encouraged by the economy’s resilience and the\nprogress on inflation to date.\nConcluding Observations\nI’ve shared a lot with you today, including about the need for reflection, learning,\nand humility for policymakers, especially in extraordinary times. The backdrop has\nbeen uncertainty – that will remain and be elevated at times. In this context, I’ll end by\noffering some concluding thoughts from my own career journey, which I hope you may\nfind helpful.\nFirst, lifelong learning is essential - for individuals and for institutions. I see this\nas more than an activity – it is a mindset. In an uncertain, evolving world, drawing\nlessons from past experiences will help us do better and improve outcomes.\n17\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDeveloping new skills and expanding knowledge positions us for future opportunities. I\nhope you also agree that it is great fun. For me, learning is one of life’s joys.\nSecond, seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives –\nincluding those you may disagree with – is a valuable practice, for policymaking, for\nwork, and in life. Listen well so that you can learn. Hopefully, you’ll also develop strong\npartners and collaborators who can assist and support you in navigating uncertain\ncontexts. And I encourage you to share your own perspectives – smart, capable\nWellesley women have a lot to contribute!\nA third, related, point is the importance of gathering information broadly. This\ndeepens understandings and can help moderate uncertainty. By information, I mean\nboth quantitative data, which is core to empirical economics, and qualitative information,\nsuch as from case studies and narratives. I’m excited to see technology leading to new\ndata sets we can parse for insights. I also see intentionally hearing from a wide range\nof stakeholders as complementary to the collection and analysis of statistical data –\nincluding hearing from voices that have not traditionally been in the room.\nThat brings me to where we started: economics. It is a field that opens doors –\nthough there is important work, for those of us in this field, to ensure that economics\nitself is open and inclusive. For me, the discipline that intrigued me as a teen has been\na great foundation for a decades-long (still unfolding!) varied and fascinating\nprofessional career. Time and again, I’ve valued the structured approach economics\nbrings to analyzing complex contexts and to drawing inference from data sets. Its\nframeworks are extremely useful for making decisions under uncertainty. And so, I\ncongratulate, and hope to encourage and even inspire, those of you who are studying,\nand teaching economics.\nThank you for having me here to discuss this period of extraordinary uncertainty\nand challenge ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its implications for current\nand future monetary policy. Of course, uncertainty is everywhere and a fact of life.\nLearning, data, frameworks and flexibility can help us address it and can also enrich our\nlives professionally and personally.\nIt has been a pleasure to share my views, and I wish each of you the very best.\n18\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nReferences\nBall, Laurence. 1999. “Aggregate Demand and Long-Run Unemployment.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity No. 2: 189–251.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2004. “Gradualism.” Speech delivered at an economics luncheon cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Seattle Branch) and the\nUniversity of Washington.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. Price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy, and an important precondition for\nmaximum employment that is sustainable over time.\nCollins continues to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too-high inflation. The\nfocus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to the 2 percent target.\n2. While recent inflation readings have been encouraging, inflation remains too high. Some\nimportant components of inflation have yet to show sustained improvement.\nAlthough still elevated, inflation is down from its earlier peak. However, most of the moderation in core\ninflation has come from a decline in goods inflation. Shelter inflation has also moderated recently, and will\nlikely ease further. However, inflation in core services excluding shelter (over half of the Fed’s preferred\ninflation measure) has yet to show improvement consistent with price stability.\n3. Collins fully supports the FOMC’s attentiveness to inflation risks and commitment to price\nstability.\nSustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming into better balance with supply across the\neconomy. While there is some evidence this realignment is underway, especially in the labor market,\neconomic activity continues to be above trend and it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a\nsustainable trajectory back to target. Collins agrees with the policy guidance in the median SEP projections\nwhich show rates staying higher, and for longer, than previous projections had suggested; and further\ntightening is certainly not off the table.\n4. This phase of policymaking requires considerable patience, to extract the signal from noisy data\nand to allow some temporary factors to play out. Collins is realistic about risks, but optimistic\nabout restoring price stability with an orderly realignment of demand with supply.\nThe economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be,\nhighly unusual. This phase of monetary policy requires patience. Collins is a “realistic optimist” – realistic\nabout the uncertainties, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with only a modest increase in the\nunemployment rate. She believes the pathway to achieving this outcome has widened.\n5. Across Maine (and New England), local leadership efforts are addressing economic challenges\nand promoting resurgence.\nThere are many dimensions to economic prosperity – so the Fed has a broad portfolio, including\nencouraging local initiatives to foster economic resurgence in areas facing long-term struggles. An\nessential element is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals. In Maine, there are six such\n“Working Places” efforts, and the Fed simply helps the local networks emerge and flourish. Collaborating\nto improve opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather join in the economy – is\ngood economics, good citizenship, and good business.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure being with you. I am always grateful for the\nopportunity to meet with Mainers, no matter the location, and have been to Maine\nmultiple times. In fact, I’ve made a point of visiting all the New England states in this role\n– and will continue to do so.\nI’ll start by thanking two people. First is Jim Roche, president of the Maine\nBankers’ Association. We appreciate his continued engagement with us at the Boston\nFed, as we all work to support a safe and sound banking system, which is so essential\nto a vibrant and inclusive economy. Second, I want to thank Jeanne Hulit, president and\nCEO of Maine Community Bancorp. Jeanne is of course a member of your association’s\nexecutive committee. She’s also a member of the Boston Fed’s board of directors. We\nso appreciate the insights into Maine and New England business conditions she shares\nas a member of our board.\nIn the time we have today, I’ll make some initial remarks, before taking a few\nquestions. Of course, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary\npolicy. Then I’ll provide a few perspectives on banking in New England and in particular\nMaine – highlighting the importance of banks of all sizes to a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy. I’ll end with a few points about the Fed’s work across the region, and our\nshared opportunities to collaborate in the public interest.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nI’ll start with some of my current views on the economy, the outlook, and\nmonetary policy – especially given the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s)\ndecision on policy rates this week.1 But first, my standard disclaimer: the views I\nexpress are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Fed policymaker.\nOur focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target.2\nPrice stability is essential for a well-functioning economy, and an important precondition\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230920a.htm\n“The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the\nannual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with\n2\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfor maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so reducing inflation relates to\nboth parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And as I travel around the district, I\ncontinue to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too-high\ninflation. On one of my trips to Maine I recall hearing about residents who were unable\nor unwilling to move within the state to take job offers, due in part to the rising costs of\nfuel, shelter, transportation, and other necessities.\nHowever, there has been some promising news. Although still too high, inflation\nis down from its earlier peak. And there is some evidence demand and supply are\nrealigning, especially in labor markets, which is needed to reduce the upward pressure\non prices. Importantly, the current policy phase requires patience, allowing time to better\nseparate the signal from the noise in the data.\nI’d like to say a bit about the FOMC’s decision earlier this week, and the related\neconomic projections from policymakers. As widely expected, the FOMC left interest\nrates unchanged. However, the policy statement makes clear that this decision need not\nimply having reached the peak federal funds rate in this tightening cycle. Future\ndecisions will depend on a holistic assessment of incoming data.\nThe FOMC also released an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nprepared by all the Fed Board’s governors and Reserve Bank presidents, which\ncertainly reinforces the statement’s message. The median expectation for the federal\nfunds rate in the SEP features one more 25 basis-point increase this year and, relative\nto the June projections, a more gradual process of policy normalization in 2024 and ’25.\nThis federal funds rate projection underscores the Committee’s focus on\nrestoring price stability while also recognizing the other part of our mandate: maximum\nsustainable employment. Indeed, the median SEP forecast expects a normalization of\nlabor market conditions that contributes to inflation running at levels consistently close\nto target by 2025 to ‘26.\n\nachievement of both parts of the dual mandate.”\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI fully support the FOMC statement and agree with the policy guidance in the\nmedian SEP projections. I expect rates may have to stay higher, and for longer, than\nprevious projections had suggested, and further tightening is certainly not off the table.\nPolicymakers will stay the course to achieve the Fed’s mandate.\nMy views on policy reflect my assessment of current conditions and the outlook\nfor inflation and real activity. I noted earlier that there are some promising signs that\ninflation is moderating and the economy rebalancing. But progress has not been linear\nand is not evenly distributed across sectors.\nStarting with inflation, I’ll focus on so-called core inflation, which excludes the\nimportant but volatile food and energy components, because it is typically a better\ngauge of underlying trends than total inflation. Recent readings have been encouraging\n– but disaggregating the key components provides valuable insight into recent pricing\npatterns. In particular, doing so highlights that most of the moderation in core inflation\nhas come from a noticeable decline in core goods inflation, as supply bottlenecks have\nresolved. A second key component, shelter inflation, has also moderated recently, and\nwill likely ease further as slower growth in new market rents is reflected in the overall\nindex. However, inflation in core services excluding shelter, which accounts for over half\nof our preferred core inflation measure, has yet to show the sustained improvement that\nwould be consistent with price stability.\nSo while there have been promising developments, it is too soon to be confident\nthat inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to the 2 percent target. I’ll also note the\nimportance of caution in reading too much from individual data points, or even from a\nfew months of information. The monthly inflation data, for example, have always been\nnoisy. But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic.\nConsiderable uncertainty remains around underlying inflation conditions. Extracting\ntrends and patterns from noisy incoming data will take patience.\nI’ve also noted that sustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming\ninto better balance with supply across the economy. Some signs that a broad\nrebalancing process is underway can be found in the labor market – which is still\nresilient overall, but cooling. In particular, the pace of hiring has slowed, although it\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nremains above trend. Job vacancies have declined and quit rates are nearly down to\npre-pandemic levels. Also contributing to the labor market rebalancing is an\nimprovement in supply. Indeed, we’ve seen some encouraging recent increases in labor\nforce participation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54).\nOver time, labor market rebalancing should result in wage growth that reflects, in\naddition to productivity gains, cost-of-living increases consistent with the Fed’s 2\npercent target. Such rebalancing should contribute to a moderation in inflation in the\ncontext of maximum sustainable employment.\nThis brings me to my outlook for the economy. Monetary policy has tightened\nconsiderably to date, but economic activity has been resilient – and it may be taking\nlonger than usual to see the broader economic impact of monetary policy actions.\nIn particular, demand may have been less sensitive to higher interest rates so\nfar, because policy tightening has occurred amidst business and household\nfundamentals that are sound compared with previous cycles. Many firms have been\ninsulated from the rate hikes by extending the maturity of their debt when rates were\nlow, and because of higher profit margins. But cash levels are returning to prepandemic norms and debt-market activity is picking up. In addition, households’ excess\nsaving accumulated during the pandemic is declining, while reliance on credit card\nspending is rising. This all suggests that business and household spending are likely to\nbecome more interest sensitive, helping to temper demand growth and realign it with\nsupply.\nI continue to expect that the full effects of monetary policy will eventually show\nthrough and place inflation on a sustainable trajectory back to 2 percent. But I’ll note\nthat the timing and ultimate impact of policy tightening to date remain uncertain.\nHistorical evidence is largely based on experiences in which policy rates moved more\nslowly than in the current cycle.\nIn all, the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have\nbeen, and continue to be, highly unusual, with important implications for policy setting.\nAs I’ve said before, this phase of policy requires considerable patience, enabling\npolicymakers to better extract the correct signal from the incoming data, and allowing\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsome factors that have been supporting near-term activity to play out. The risk of\ninflation remaining persistently high must be weighed against the risk that activity will\nslow more than expected. I also recognize the potential for higher short-term rates to\nplace more pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision\nmore than I anticipate.\nI continue to be a “realistic optimist” – realistic about the uncertainties and risks\nto my baseline outlook, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly\nslowdown in activity, and only a modest unemployment rate increase associated with\nsupply and demand in labor markets coming into better balance. Importantly, the\nongoing resilience I see in the economy and the progress on inflation so far lead me to\nbelieve that the pathway to achieving this desirable outcome has widened.\nPolicy remains well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic\nenvironment, recognizing and balancing the risks while remaining resolute and datadependent, with the flexibility to adjust policy appropriately as conditions warrant.\nMaine’s Economy and Banking Sector\nI’ll turn now from the national economy to Maine’s. In my recent visits to your\nstate, I spoke with a range of people, and learned about some of the unique challenges\nand economic strengths. Challenges include the fact that Maine has a population that is\nolder, and aging faster, than the New England region and the rest of the nation. That\nreality tends to reduce the availability of labor, which is something businesses large and\nsmall mentioned often.\nAccess to affordable housing also remains a major issue. Maine employers told\nme about their difficulties finding and hiring workers for needed roles, in part because\nprospective employees are unable to find affordable housing in the area. And I know\nthat expanding access to broadband in Maine’s rural counties has been challenge, but\nremains a priority.\nI’ve also learned about Maine’s many wonderful economic strengths. Among\nthem are the state’s rich natural resources – on land and in the Gulf of Maine – as well\n\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nas strong retail and healthcare industries, robust tourism and hospitality sectors,\nabundant small businesses, and a strong sense of community and pride of place.\nAnother strength, of course, is Maine’s banking industry. Your banks employ as\nmany as 9,000 Mainers, serving households and businesses across the state in\ncommunities large and small. Of course, banks face challenges, in addition to those in\nthe current interest rate environment. Evolving customer preferences require increasing\ninvestment in technology, and you’re seeing increased margin pressure related to\ncompetition for deposits, and competition from new market entrants.\nToday I want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating\nvibrant, inclusive economies. Community banks, like those in Maine, have remained\nresilient and continue to leverage the close working relationships they have within\nsmaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Community banks provide a critical source of\nfunding for small businesses. This was demonstrated, for example, during the\nimplementation of the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, as\ncommunity banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached businesses.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system,\nalong with effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps to ensure that banks\nof all sizes can meet the needs of households and businesses in every community\nthroughout our country, in good times and in bad. And I fully agree that we must\npreserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region\nFinally, let me say a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our\noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that\nworks for everyone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions – so\nthe Fed has a broad portfolio of activities and engagements – all in the public interest –\nincluding monetary policymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision,\nfinancial stability work, serving as lender of last resort for banks, community and\neconomic development activities, and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments,\ntechnology, and finance. They all support our mission and our mandate.\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI’ll very briefly mention some of our work to support economic vibrancy in all\nareas of New England, with a goal of expanding opportunities for everyone to\nparticipate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging local efforts to\nfind economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long-term struggles –\nwe call it “Working Places.” It’s based on research showing that an essential element of\nplace-based economic resilience is cross-sector collaboration, among local individuals\nwilling to take on shared leadership. In Maine, there are such local efforts in six areas:\nGreater Bangor, the Katahdin region, Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Highlands, Sagadahoc\nCounty, and in Washington County with the Passamaquoddy Tribe.\nThe Fed’s work helps the local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. We\nfind that people really do want to work together to solve problems. I suspect that’s\nbecause improving opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather\njoin in the economy – is good economics, good citizenship, and good business! I’m\nencouraged that local, tangible efforts like these are adding up to real strength in our\nregion. I know Maine’s bankers work to provide the services and credit that help\ncommunities prosper, and at the central bank we look forward to continuing to\ncollaborate with you in the public interest.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I’ll say that the privilege and responsibility of a policymaking role\nlike mine makes frequent engagement with stakeholders essential. So I will continue to\nprioritize taking cross-sector visits to each New England state, and hearing from those\nin a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our economy and the financial\nsystem.\nSince its inception 110 years ago and by its very design, the U.S. central bank\nhas deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers; ranging from safety and\nsoundness to payments infrastructure, to credit access and economic development. I\nlook forward to continuing to work with you to support the people and places of Maine,\nNew England, and the nation with a vibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.\nThank you again for having me join you today.\n7\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. Holistic Assessment: Collins reviews a wide range of information to assess the evolving\neconomy. She looks for patterns and trends showing sustained reductions in inflation, and progress\non the underlying goal of bringing demand and supply back into better balance. She notes that price\nstability is essential for a well-functioning economy and an important precondition for maximum\nemployment that is sustainable over time.\n2. Current Indications: Strong demand relative to supply has been a key factor driving higher\ninflation. While we are seeing some signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply,\ncreating price pressures. Core inflation shows modest and relatively recent moderation. There are\npromising developments, but given continued strength in demand, Collins’ view is that it is just too\nearly to take the recent improvements as evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to the 2%\ntarget.\n3. Patience and Data Dependence: This phase of monetary policy calls for patience and holistic\ndata dependence. One reason is the difficulty of extracting signal from noise in the data. Another is\nincreased uncertainty about the timing and ultimate impact on the economy of policy tightening to date\n– including some reasons to expect longer lags than normal due to some unique aspects of the\npandemic recovery.\n4. Staying Resolute: Importantly, patience does not mean indecision, or a change in commitment to\nthe 2 percent target and to achieving price stability in a reasonable amount of time. Collins expects\nwe’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time. And while we may be near, or even at, the\npeak, further tightening could be warranted, depending on incoming data. We are well positioned to\nproceed patiently, carefully, yet deliberately; recognizing the risks while remaining resolute.\n5. Optimistic While Realistic: Continued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further,\nto bring it into better balance with supply – however, Collins does not believe a significant slowdown is\nrequired. She remains realistic about the risks and uncertainties around the outlook, while optimistic\nthat price stability is achievable with an orderly slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate\nincrease – ideally preserving some of the current favorable labor market dynamics.\n6. Engagement and Collaboration: The Fed’s mandate and concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy\nlead us to study economic issues that prevent people from participating in the economy or workforce,\nas well as the gaps in wealth accumulation and prosperity. Collins will continue to prioritize hearing\nfrom those in a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our region’s economy. The Boston Fed\nwill continue working to support a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity, working\ncollaboratively with organizations across the region to understand and address challenges.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be with you, at this podium where the New\nEngland Council hosts so many distinguished leaders. I’d like to thank Jim Brett for\ninviting me, early on, to speak with you.\nI have been looking forward to this, because of my great appreciation for the\nCouncil, and its members, working to keep New England’s economy vibrant. As a\nmacroeconomist and former dean of a public policy school, I appreciate your focus on\nthe ways policymakers, and organizations across New England, can collaborate in the\npublic interest.\nI also appreciate the New England Council’s non-partisan nature, and the\nbreadth of industries and sectors you work in. This an extraordinary region, in part\nbecause of that range – and the brainpower, innovation, and character New Englanders\nbring to the table.\nMy thanks as well to Jim, for contributing his insights over many years to an\nadvisory council made up of small- and medium-sized businesses we convene at the\nFed every quarter.\nToday, I’ll start with a bit of context about our work at the Fed. Then, I’ll share\nsome of my current views on the economy and monetary policy. Finally, I’ll comment on\nsome of the challenges and opportunities ahead, and the roles the Boston Fed and\nothers can play. Then, I’ll be happy to take questions. But first, my standard disclaimer:\nThese perspectives are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Federal Reserve\npolicymakers.\nContext: Roles and Responsibilities Entrusted to the Fed\nI like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy that works for everyone, not just some people. As you know, the strength of\nan economy has many dimensions – so the Fed is involved in a number of activities, all\nin the public interest.\nBut let me underline an important distinction, which is not always wellunderstood. The Federal Reserve’s activities are in monetary – not fiscal – policy. At\nthe Fed, we’re entrusted with monetary policymaking – in particular, setting short-term\ninterest rates that ultimately affect the availability of money and credit for businesses\nand households. In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable\nprices and maximum employment. So we spend a lot of time analyzing economic\nconditions – using data, doing research, and listening to stakeholders locally and\nnationally.\nThe economy also needs reliable credit, and payment systems. The Fed is\nentrusted with responsibilities regarding the safety, soundness, and stability of the\nbanking and financial systems; and we serve as a lender of last resort to financial\ninstitutions. We also provide back-end infrastructure to the banking system and the\nU.S. Treasury, ranging from currency and coin circulation, to various ways to transfer\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfunds electronically. For many years we have been involved in innovating to make\npayments systems more effective and efficient.\nThe Economy, the Outlook, and Monetary Policy\nI’ll turn, now, to sharing some of my current views on the economy, the outlook,\nand monetary policy. Our focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2\npercent target.1 Price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy and an\nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so\nreducing inflation relates to both parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And I\ncontinue to hear, in travels around New England, about the toll from high inflation on\nhouseholds – especially those with lower incomes, struggling to make ends meet – and\non businesses, often as they grapple with higher costs and more complex planning and\ninvestment decisions.\nI like to give my bottom-line up front, and in my view, this phase of our policy\ncycle requires patience, and holistic data assessment, while we stay the course. I\nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time. And while we may be\nnear, or even at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted,\ndepending on the incoming data. Patience will give us time to better separate “signal”\nfrom “noise” as we assess available data; and to balance risks, as the effects of tighter\npolicy continue to work through the economy.\nLet me briefly explain my rationale. Since I see holistic data assessment as\nparticularly important in the current context, I’ve shared a handout with some charts\nshowing just a few of the many data series I review, as part of the wide range of\ninformation I use to assess the evolving economy.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nIn reviewing economic data, I look for patterns and trends that show both\nsustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the underlying goal of bringing\ndemand and supply back into better balance. I’ll start there, because strong demand\nrelative to supply has been a key factor driving higher inflation. While we are seeing\nsome signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply, creating price\npressures.\nThe black line in Figure 1 shows how the level of real GDP (or the production of\ngoods and services adjusted for inflation) has evolved relative to trend, shown by the\n\n1\n“The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the annual\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with achievement of both\nparts of the dual mandate.” https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary‐policy‐what‐are‐its‐goals‐\nhow‐does‐it‐work.htm\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndotted line. The trend is an estimate of sustainable output for the economy over time.2\nA key takeaway is that GDP remains above trend — a sign of demand continuing to\noutstrip supply. Many forecasters expect continued above-trend growth this quarter.\nGDP growth has been supported, importantly, by resilient household consumption\nexpenditures – shown by the light blue line – which is the largest component of\naggregate demand.\nWhat about inflation, in this context of demand still outpacing supply? There are\nmany inflation indicators to watch, of course. Focusing on the Fed’s preferred\nmeasure,3 Figure 2, Panel A shows that on a year-over-year basis, total inflation (the\ndark blue line) has come down significantly from its peak but remains somewhat\nelevated. However, core inflation (the light blue line) shows considerably less progress,\nalthough with some improvement in recent months. While the core measure excludes\nthe important but volatile food and energy components, it tends to better predict future\ninflation.\nI’m showing these two panels side by side so you can see how the monthly\ninflation data – including core inflation, shown in Figure 2, Panel B – tend to be more\nvariable than measures on a year-over-year basis. This variability has increased since\nthe pandemic, a point I’ll return to in a moment, and is one reason for being patient in\nassessing the data.\nFigure 3 Panels A, B, and C show the three main components of core inflation.\nSince the components behave quite differently, looking at them separately helps to\nbetter assess price pressures. These charts include 3- , 6-, and 12- month annualized\nchanges. The shorter horizons highlight recent developments – but are typically more\nvariable, or “noisier.” Looking at multiple time horizons can help paint a fuller picture of\nhow inflation is evolving.\nPanel A shows that the moderation in core inflation has come mainly from a\nsignificant decline in the core goods sector, where the resolution of supply chain\nbottlenecks has helped to better align demand with supply. Panel B shows that shelter\ninflation, though still high, has slowed recently as well: the 3-month change is below the\n6-month. As moderation in new market rents continues to pass through, this decline will\nlikely continue. However, as shown in Panel C, core services price inflation, excluding\nshelter, has slowed only modestly so far. This component accounts for about 55\npercent of core inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE).\n\n2\n\nThis trend assumes real GDP growth of 1.8% per year. The shaded bar in the chart represents the pandemic\nrecession.\n3\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE index.\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSo, there are promising developments, but given the continued strength in\ndemand, my view is that it is just too early to take the recent improvements as evidence\nthat inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\nI’ll next turn briefly to the labor market. There too, demand continues to outstrip\nsupply overall – a very familiar refrain in much of New England and across the country,\nfor some time now – but we are seeing evidence of improved alignment. Panel A of\nFigure 4 shows that payroll employment continues to grow above trend, but has been\nslowing. Lower voluntary quits and lower, though still high, job vacancies (not shown)\nare also consistent with a cooling but resilient labor market.\nOn the labor supply side, we’ve seen some recent increases in labor force\nparticipation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54) as shown in Panel B.\nIt is encouraging that more people are entering the labor force, which is the reason why\nthe unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8 percent in August — notably, a level that is still\nvery low by historical standards.\nI also review disaggregated labor market data, recognizing that aggregate\nnumbers do not show the wide range of experiences across groups of people, sectors,\nand places. For example, Figure 5 shows the persistent disparities in unemployment –\nfor different racial and ethnic groups in panel A, and for people with different education\nlevels in panel B. I’ll have more to say about such disparities, in a moment.\nOverall, then, rebalancing demand and supply in the labor market has some way\nto go. In particular, Figure 6 shows wage inflation, measured here by the Employment\nCost Index or ECI on a quarterly and yearly basis. Wage growth remains elevated in\nthe current high inflation environment. Recognizing that workers benefit from increases\nin their real wages, or purchasing power, I look forward to returning to an environment\nwith wage growth consistent with the 2 percent inflation target.4\nContinued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further to bring it\ninto better balance with supply – however, importantly, I do not believe a significant\nslowdown is required. I have described myself for some time as a “realistic optimist” –\nrealistic about the risks and uncertainties around a baseline outlook, while optimistic\nbecause the resilience I see leads me to believe price stability is achievable with an\norderly slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate increase – ideally preserving\nsome of the favorable labor supply dynamics.\nMonetary Policy Lags and My Outlook\nI’ll shift now to a brief assessment of the impact of monetary policy actions to\ndate, and my outlook.\n\n4\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has noted, “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to\nbe sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.” (see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm).\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs Figure 7 shows, starting in March 2022, we raised the federal funds rate\ntarget by five and a quarter percentage points in just 18 months, the fastest policy rate\nincrease in 40 years. While the effects of higher interest rates were almost immediately\nevident in the housing sector, they have been slower to show through to broader\nindicators of activity, such as GDP and labor market statistics.\nTypically, monetary policy actions are estimated to meaningfully affect broader\nmeasures of economic activity with a lag of four to six quarters.5 But there is\nconsiderable variation around this estimate, and special factors in the pandemic\nrecovery are likely making these lags longer than usual.\nIn particular, policy tightening has occurred amidst sound business and\nhousehold fundamentals, compared to previous hiking cycles – likely implying a longer\ntime for tighter credit conditions to work through the economy. For example, many firms\nhad refinanced when interest rates were very low, somewhat insulating their investment\nplans from higher rates. And households that accumulated excess savings during the\npandemic have needed to borrow less than usual so far, to finance expenditures.\nSo monetary policy may take longer than normal to affect the broader economy.\nBut given that policy is clearly in restrictive territory, I do expect to see slowing growth\nby the end of this year and throughout 2024. And there are already some signs\nconsistent with this outlook. Firms’ cash levels are returning to pre-pandemic trends,\nand households’ excess savings are declining.6 Demand should slow as spending\nbecomes more interest sensitive.\nThe goal is an orderly slowdown that better aligns demand with supply, which is\nessential to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to target.\nImplications for Monetary Policy in an Uncertain Environment\nI’ll conclude my discussion of the economy by highlighting some considerations\nthat underpin my outlook. The economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and\nrecovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual, with implications for monetary\npolicy. This complex topic is likely to be a long-term focus for analysis and research.\nI’ve flagged two key dimensions: First, we’re in a period where it is difficult to\nextract the signal from the noise in the data. As I noted, some data, such as monthly\n\n5\n\nThese lags appear in various estimates of the effects of monetary policy, for instance those surveyed by Ramey\n(Ramey, V.A., 2016; \"Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation,\" in: J. B. Taylor & Harald Uhlig [ed.],\nHandbook of Macroeconomics, edition 1, volume 2, chapter 2, pages 71‐162, Elsevier). A more recent study\nconfirming significant lags in the effects is Romer and Romer (Christina D. Romer & David H. Romer, 2023; \"Does\nMonetary Policy Matter? The Narrative Approach after 35 Years,\" NBER Working Papers 31170, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, Inc.).\n6\n\nSome households, including those at the lower end of the income distribution, have likely already depleted any\nexcess savings.\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nPCE inflation, are unusually volatile.7 Second, there is increased uncertainty about the\ntiming and ultimate impact on the economy from policy tightening to date. Reasons\ninclude the unusually sound initial business and household fundamentals, and the\nunusually rapid initial pace of tightening.\nThe risk of inflation staying higher for longer must now be weighed against the\nrisk that an overly restrictive stance of monetary policy will lead to a greater slowdown in\nactivity than is needed to restore price stability. This context calls for a patient and\ncareful, but deliberate, approach to policy, allowing time to assess the effects of policy\nactions to date, and then acting appropriately. Importantly, patience does not mean\nindecision, or a change in the commitment to the 2 percent target, but rather time to\nensure that the economy is on a clear trajectory to achieve price stability.\nOverall, we are well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic\nenvironment, recognizing the risks while remaining resolute and data-dependent, with\nthe flexibility to adjust as conditions warrant.\nA Vibrant, Inclusive Economy\nI started with comments about the strengths of New England. I’d like to close by\nalluding to some of the challenges I hear about, too – and some of the things\norganizations like yours, and mine, are doing about them.\nThe privilege and responsibility of policymaking make engagement with\nstakeholders essential. So I will continue to prioritize taking cross-sector visits to each\nNew England state, and hearing from those in a wide range of roles, who make up and\nshape our region’s economy (see Figure 8).\nAgain, our domain at the Fed is monetary, not fiscal, policy. But our mandate\nand our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to the challenges that\nprevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce – real economic\nissues like childcare, housing, climate, and infrastructure, such as transportation and\nbroadband. And like many of you, we worry about the gaps in wealth accumulation and\nprosperity by group and place.8\n\n7\n\nMonth‐to‐month consumer spending patterns have also been somewhat unusual and continue to evolve,\ncomplicating seasonal adjustment.\n8\n\nThe Boston Fed has a decades‐long history of studying wealth disparities for groups and places. We believe\nbetter understanding these gaps can expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring\nmore people into the workforce, and strengthen economic growth and competitiveness. A healthy economy\nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute,\nand prosper. In this context, the Boston Fed ‐ working with community partners ‐ recently launched a multi‐year\nresearch initiative to explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts. Initial priorities for\nthis work include measuring family wealth and exploring wealth differences between racial‐ethnic groups and\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThese are very real challenges. But I remain optimistic about what we all,\ntogether, can accomplish when we care, collaborate, study, and act. Here are a few\nexamples.\nMany parts of New England that were once centers for manufacturing or natural\nresources have faced long-term challenges. Our Working Places initiative, started in\n2014 under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an\nessential element of place-based economic resurgence is local, cross-sector\ncollaboration. Now in 30 communities across 5 states, teams of local leaders choose a\nshared goal for improving the economy that benefits low-income people, and then\ndevelop and implement strategies. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these\nefforts – but not financially. The real work is in local ingenuity and commitment.9\nLack of affordable childcare is a very real economic issue across New England\nand nationally. Childcare gives options to parents who want or need to participate in the\nworkforce. As an outgrowth of our Working Places effort, a team in Fitchburg has\nimplemented a bilingual childcare entrepreneur training program to help support\nindividuals in opening up their own small businesses in childcare. It has 80 graduates\nand just started its fifth cohort.10\nClimate change is on many business and government leaders’ minds, and the\nFed’s responsibilities make it important and prudent for us to study the issues. For\nexample, our recent research examines potential costs related to climate change for\nMassachusetts cities and towns – and ultimately taxpayers. We find that per capita\nlocal spending could grow significantly in the decades ahead, with hotter and stormier\nweather increasing the cost of public works, government administration, operation of\nschools, and other public services.11\nLast but not least, I mentioned earlier the Fed’s work on payments. It wasn’t that\nlong ago that paper checks had to be flown around the country to settle at the bank they\nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity. The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer\ndigital check imaging, and expanded automated clearing – and more recently, creation\nof an entirely new instant-payments infrastructure to help banks of all sizes meet\n\nacross geographies. We want to better understand why certain disparities persist, and hope the findings will be\nused by a broad group of public, private, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions.\n9\n\nLearn more about Working Places at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n\n10\n\nLearn more at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/news/2022/tackling‐the‐child‐care‐crisis‐lele‐\nteammates‐see‐child‐care‐training‐need‐fill‐it.aspx. And similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut Working Places\nteam has provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home‐based childcare facilities, opening 15 new\nfacilities so far. The vision and effort is local, but organizations like ours can help spark or support the progress.\n11\n\nSee the summary by Larry Bean and the study by Bo Zhao: https://www.bostonfed.org/news‐and‐\nevents/news/2023/01/price‐tag‐on‐climate‐change‐bo‐zhao‐report‐boston‐fed‐massachusetts.aspx\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncustomer needs. In July, we launched the FedNow instant payments service – and the\nnational program leader is the Boston Fed’s C.O.O., Ken Montgomery.12\nConcluding Observations\nAcross New England, I hear that people from all sectors want to collaborate and\nwork together to solve problems like these. Efforts large and small, in combination, can\nmake a real difference.\nWe will continue, at the Boston Fed, working to serve the public interest and\nsupport a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity. It is a privilege and a\nresponsibility, and we look forward to collaborating with many of you, to help the region\nthrive.\nThank you for having me join you today.\n\n12\n\nSee the announcement at https://www.frbservices.org/news/press‐releases/072023‐fednow‐live‐\nannouncement\n8\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. To build a vibrant, inclusive economy, we need the best ideas, energy, and participation\nfrom everyone. Community colleges play a critical role in this important work by providing\naffordable, accessible higher education and essential skill development – ultimately\nstrengthening our economy and society.\n2. Collins said we can and should do much more to discover and nurture the potential in\npeople with a range of experiences and backgrounds – including individuals who may be\nthe first in their family to attend college and individuals who may look different in\nappearance from those who’ve traditionally held particular roles.\n3. Reflecting on her first 14 months as Boston Fed president, Collins said she’s been\nimpressed and encouraged by the leaders and residents she’s met who are working to\nensure everyone has a chance to participate and thrive in the economy. The Boston Fed\nbelieves in the power of collaborative leadership to make local economies stronger and\nmore inclusive. The Bank knows from experience that tangible, practical, community-based\nefforts serve to strengthen our region.\n4. Collins commended community college students for having resilience, determination, and\nthe ability to overcome challenges. These traits, she added, give them the potential to be\nhighly capable contributors to economy. She also shared her appreciation for the faculty\nand staff supporting those students.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIt is truly a pleasure to join you this morning for the 2023 Bunker Hill\nConvocation! It’s always wonderful to be among faculty and staff, and I am delighted to\nknow many students are here as well. I want to thank President Eddinger and Provost\nCaniff for inviting me to be with you today.\nThe start to a new academic year is a very exciting time – and I know, also an\nextremely busy one. Having spent most of my career in academia, your convocation\nreminds me of so many starts to the academic year – initially as a student, then for\nabout 25 years as a faculty member, and for nearly another 15 as a university\nadministrator. I have many wonderful memories of meeting students; launching\nprograms; and welcoming, and welcoming back, faculty and staff – who are the\nessential pillars in every higher education institution.\nIn my current role, I lead an institution that, like yours, has a public mission. At\nthe Federal Reserve, we work to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy – characterized by\nour congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment – an\neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people. However, we know that\neconomic outcomes for some people, some communities, and some places have\ndiverged – despite best efforts – and therefore, many have been unable to fully\nparticipate in the economy. A healthy economy needs the best ideas, energy, and\nparticipation from everyone – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute, and prosper.\nIn that context, I have a particular appreciation for the critical role that Bunker Hill\nCommunity College plays in the greater Boston region. More broadly, I’m thinking\nabout the essential ways community colleges serve our educational system in New\nEngland, and nationally. Simply put, community colleges are foundational to higher\neducation in this country. They enroll nearly half of all first-time undergraduate\nstudents1 and provide an affordable, accessible opportunity for investing in essential\nskills. Here at Bunker Hill, you are supporting students of all ages and backgrounds,\n\nSee “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility” by Jack Mountjoy, American Economic Review, Vol.\n112, No. 8, Aug. 2022 (pp. 2580-2630): https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181756.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmany who are the first generation in their families to attend college.2 Your students are\nwonderfully diverse, and you’ve earned the designation of a Hispanic-Serving\nInstitution, and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving\nInstitution, from the U.S. Department of Education. I want to express my admiration and\nappreciation for all that you do to support and invest in your students. You are\nstrengthening our economy and our society.\nIn my remarks this morning, I’d like to talk about two things. First, I’ll briefly discuss\nmy own career trajectory, with a bit of reflection on lessons and takeaways that I hope\nyou will find helpful. Then I’d like to share my perspective on the importance of a\nvibrant, inclusive economy and mention some of the ways we at the Fed, community\ncolleges like yours, and people across the region are working to achieve that goal. In\nthis discussion, I have a few key themes, including: the vital role of community colleges,\nespecially your work here at Bunker Hill. I’ll also touch on the importance of\npartnerships and collaboration – since success in my work, and yours, requires all of us\nworking together. And finally, since this is a convocation beginning a new academic\nyear, I’ll offer a thought on beginning, persisting, and finishing.\n\nMy Own Path\nI’d much prefer to talk about the work of the Boston Fed, or Bunker Hill\nCommunity College, than about myself. But I am often asked how I got to be in this\nrole, and whether I have advice for others – especially since I am the first woman of\ncolor to lead a Federal Reserve Bank. I see this as an honor, a privilege, and a\nresponsibility. So, I’ll share some brief reflections based on my own path.\nLike many of your students, I have an international background. I was born in\nScotland to Jamaican parents, and raised in New York City with frequent visits to\n\nSee “Community Colleges and the Future of Higher Education” by Michael Patrick Rutter and Steven\nMintz in Inside Higher Ed (March 2019): https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-edgamma/community-colleges-and-future-higher-education.\n2\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nJamaica. I see exposure to different cultures as something to joyfully embrace and\nlearn from – and a source of strength for navigating the inevitable challenges each of us\nencounters.\nMy parents certainly passed on their love of learning, and I see myself as a\nlifelong learner. I hope you see yourselves that way, too. While many things interested\nme early on, I took courses in economics in college, and found it really appealed to me\n– including a fascination with how analyzing data could help us understand the complex\neconomy. Studying economics in graduate school, my experiences visiting Jamaica\nand other countries led me to specialize in the international aspects of\nmacroeconomics, with a focus on econometrics, or data analysis.\nLike my father, I began my career in academia as a professor, engaged in\nresearch and teaching, and becoming increasingly interested in using my expertise to\nhelp improve public policies. I eventually moved to academic administration – as dean\nof a public policy school, and then provost. Then fourteen months ago, I started in this\nposition, giving me the opportunity to use my background and experiences now as a\npolicymaker, serving the public interest.\nI know many Bunker Hill students are the first in their families to attend college,\nand recognize how helpful it was for me to have parents and other family members with\nadvanced degrees. Observing them made it easier for me to see myself as a\nprofessional, possibly in a leadership position one day. But while my family saw my\npotential, I can tell you that not everyone in society saw a small, very young-looking\nblack woman as likely to become an economist, a professor, a dean, a provost, or\npresident of a Federal Reserve Bank.\nThere is much more we can, and should, do to look for and nurture the potential\nin people from all backgrounds, including – perhaps especially – people who look\ndifferent from those traditionally seen in particular roles. We should avoid making\nassumptions about the capabilities and possibilities that lie behind mere appearance.\nThis mindset influenced my work as a faculty member, and is one factor that led me to\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nacademic administration. It is also critical for the Fed – as I’ve said, a healthy economy\nneeds ideas, energy, and participation from everyone.\nI also recognize that I’ve been blessed with considerable support throughout my\neducation and career. I’ve benefitted from having a family – parents, as well as a\nhusband and now adult children – who supported and encouraged me along the way. I\nhad instructors, advisors, and mentors too; and the best ones were those who\nchallenged me the most. I am very grateful to each of them.\nBut not everyone has that level of support, which makes the work you do here at\nBunker Hill all the more important. People like to talk about trailblazers opening doors,\nbut an image that resonates with me involves the responsibility, once through that door,\nto hold it open for excellent, high-potential people. I want to congratulate and commend\nyou for opening doors – and holding them open – for your students.\nThis is a convocation, a gathering to mark a beginning of a new school year.\nBeginnings are important, but I suspect you and your students are focused on the entire\njourney – including its resolution. I’m reminded of the extraordinary Jamaican sprinter\nUsain Bolt, who said “There are better starters than me, but I’m a strong finisher.” A\nchallenging start to a journey – whether a sprint or a career – does not determine the\noutcome. What matters is staying the course and finishing. And to be clear, I do not\nsee the most important journeys in life as races. I wish you great success in your own\njourneys as you support your students throughout this school year and beyond.\n\nCreating a Vibrant, Inclusive Economy – Together\nThe Fed works to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy, and we do that in a much\nwider range of ways than most people realize – monetary policy, economic research,\nfinancial stability work and bank supervision, community and economic development\nactivities, and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and finance.\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nToday I want to mention a few aspects of the Boston Fed’s work that show the\nbreadth and depth of our efforts to support a strong economy characterized by equitable\nopportunity.\nThe Boston Fed has a reputation for analytical rigor and analysis of current\neconomic data. This is absolutely vital for policy work – as is our long-term research on\na variety of empirical and theoretical topics. We hope our nonpartisan, unbiased\nresearch is a public service. Of course, we study a range of topics related to credit,\nemployment, and inflation. But our work is much broader than that.\nUnfortunately, we can see through our own research that not everyone has the\nsame opportunities to contribute to our economy – which limits its strength and\nvibrancy. We are committed to doing our part to help address this challenge by\nfostering inclusion. Key ways we do this are by examining factors that could limit\npeople participating in the economy going forward, and by collaborating with other\norganizations.\nAs part of that work, the Boston Fed has a decades-long history of studying\nwealth disparities for groups and places. We believe better understanding these gaps\ncan expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring more\npeople into the workforce, and strengthen economic growth and competitiveness.\nIn this context, the Boston Fed recently launched a multi-year research initiative\nto explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts. It’s a\ncomplex issue, and we aren’t taking it on ourselves. Our community partners include\nthe Boston Foundation, the Barr Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, and the Greater\nBoston Chamber of Commerce.3\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Boston press release, “Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and community\npartners launch research effort to explore wealth divides” (April 2022): https://www.bostonfed.org/newsand-events/press-releases/2022/boston-fed-and-community-partners-launch-research-effort-to-explorewealth-divides.aspx\n3\n\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe initial priorities for this work include measuring family wealth and exploring\nwealth differences between racial-ethnic groups and across geographies. We want to\nbetter understand why certain disparities persist. We hope the findings will be used by\na broad group of public, private, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions that\npromote equity in wealth – which is a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.\nI’d also briefly mention the Boston Fed’s work to support community economic\ndevelopment, expanding opportunities for everyone to participate in the economy.\nSince 2014, our staff have focused on encouraging local efforts to find economic\nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long-term struggles. We call it\n“Working Places.”4\nThis initiative, started in 2014, is based on research that showed that an essential\nelement of place-based economic resilience is cross-sector collaboration among local\nindividuals willing to take on shared leadership. Now in 30 communities across 5\nstates, teams of local leaders choose a shared goal for improving the economy that\nbenefits low-income people, and then develop and implement strategies to address\nthem. They focus on issues such as workforce development, poverty reduction,\naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. This initiative has helped\nfoster collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local\norganizations, and residents. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.\nThis ongoing work demonstrates our belief in the power of collaborative networks.\nAs I talk to people in all parts of our region, I hear that people really do want to\ncollaborate and work together to solve problems. Efforts large and small are essential,\nand in combination they can make a real difference and build resilience. In this, I’m\nreminded of the Kenyan proverb, that “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”\nI think about all the working people, leaders, and organizations I’ve visited with\nover the 14 months I’ve been in this job. And in addition to being so impressed with\n\nLearn more about the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s “Working Places” initiatives:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n4\n\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwhat they are doing, I’m also incredibly encouraged that local, tangible efforts are\nadding up to real strength in our region. I’d like to tell you about a few of them, and\nhope you find them inspiring and motivating, as I do.\nOften these efforts focus on the basic, practical things that get in the way of\nparticipation in the job market and economy – whether skillsets and training, or reliable\nand affordable childcare, or transportation, or the ability to find housing that’s affordable\nin the vicinity of a job or school. It is important for us to celebrate these sorts of efforts,\nlearn from them, and build on them!\n•\n\nA first, obvious example would be right here – the way community colleges give\npeople options to affordably develop skills to lead better lives. I note in your\nmission statement that “The College provides inclusive and affordable access to\nhigher education, supports the success of all students, and forges vibrant\npartnerships and pathways...” And I know you work so hard to provide\n“wraparound” services that help smooth the issues that may be getting in the way\nof students continuing to progress. I also note the range of partnerships with\norganizations you’ve built, to give your students options and opportunities. As\nsomeone who thinks about the economy’s health all the time, I just want to thank\nand commend you for that vital work.\n\n•\n\nAnother example – another stick strengthening that bundle – is in Connecticut,\nwhere East Hartford CONNects has launched a Professional Skills Academy with\nthe goal of connecting residents with local employers – in the words of their\ndirector, trying to fill the gap between folks saying, “We need training,” and\nemployers saying, “We will hire anyone as long as they’re career-ready.” A\nrelated effort recruits underrepresented groups into manufacturing with training,\nand stipends that make it possible for people to take time for that training.\n\n•\n\nOther examples touch on the critical economic issue of child care, which gives\noptions to parents who want or need to participate in the workforce. To that end,\n\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nLeaders for Equitable Local Economies5 is an outgrowth of our Working Places\neffort, and in Fitchburg, the team has implemented a bilingual child care\nentrepreneur training program to help support individuals in opening up their own\nsmall businesses in childcare. The program has 80 graduates and started its fifth\ncohort this month! Similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut Working Places team\nhas provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home-based child\ncare facilities. So far, 15 new facilities have opened.\nThere are so many other examples I could mention, from longstanding initiatives\nsuch as the public-private partnership facilitated by the Boston Private Industry Council\nfor the Boston Fed and many other employers to hire summer interns from Boston\nPublic Schools, to very recent ones such as the Boston Fed’s Economic Research\nImmersion pilot program this past summer for a small number of community college\nstudents – most from here at Bunker Hill.6 As I go around the region and meet with the\nwide range of the Fed’s stakeholders, people I talk to cite many challenges in our\neconomy in New England, and also many strengths and opportunities. I find these\nstories of people and organizations making a difference to be inspiring and so gratifying.\nWhat you do, what your students do, what we at the Boston Fed are doing, and\nwhat people are doing across New England are all part of making our economy resilient,\nvibrant, and inclusive. Efforts like these are adding to that Kenyan proverb’s bundle and\nhelping to make it unbreakable.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I’ll just say that it is so essential that all in society have\nopportunities to enhance skills.

While no one would wish hardships on a person, there is\nno doubt that your students have built capability, resilience, grit, and the ability to\nmanage many challenges. This gives them the potential to be some of our economy’s\nmost capable contributors. We all do well to recognize that in them!\nHowever, let’s think about that analogy of rough seas.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nMay 31, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fOpening Remarks\nGood morning. I am Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, and it’s my\npleasure to welcome you – whether here in person or online -- to the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston for this half-day forum on several aspects of the post-pandemic\neconomy.\nThank you all for joining us today. Special thanks to Fed Governor Michelle\nBowman for coming to the Boston Fed for our FedListens event. Before I invite\nGovernor Bowman to give some opening remarks, I’ll just say a few things about our\nevent today.\nAs you may know, it is part of a series the Federal Reserve began a few years\nago, and the second we’ve hosted here in Boston. 1 The FedListens series is an\nimportant opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional banks and the Board of\nGovernors in Washington, to expand the ways we hear from participants in the\neconomy.\nThat’s why, today, we’ve brought together panelists and audience members who\nreflect the diversity of the New England region. For some of you, this may be your first\nopportunity to engage with the Boston Fed – we look forward to your participation.\nThere are a number of Fed leaders in the room today, including those\nresponsible for economic research and for community development, among other key\nareas. Our goal today, as leaders at the Federal Reserve, is that we really listen to you,\nto help us deepen our understanding of post-pandemic experiences, and of the\nchallenges and opportunities facing each of you, and our region.\nOur conversations today focus on three key topics - labor markets, housing, and\nstate and local fiscal health. We’ve distributed some background materials on each,\nand hope you’ve found them informative and helpful.\nAnd as you’ll hear more about shortly, we have ensured a variety of ways for you\nto share your views with us, whether you are on a panel, in the room or online.\nSo, I want to welcome you all again – and it’s now my pleasure to invite Governor\nMichelle Bowman to the podium.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGovernor Bowman has served as a member of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board in Washington, she\nserved as the state bank commissioner of Kansas, and prior to that, as vice president of\nFarmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. At the Federal Reserve, Gov. Bowman has been a\nleader and a proponent of these FedListens gatherings, and we’re thrilled to have her\nhere with us today.\n###\nClosing Remarks\nLet me close out our gathering by first offering my sincere thanks to our\nmoderators, panelists, attendees. We greatly appreciate today’s robust discussion, and\nyour valuable insights – in the panel sessions, around the tables, and from input shared\nby those online.\nThanks as well to Governor Bowman and the other members of the Board of\nGovernors for promoting events such as this one. It is so important for policymakers to\nhave windows like this, into regional experience and perspectives.\nI want to say just a few things about how I believe we can use the insights gained\ntoday to advance the work we are charged with doing here at the Fed. First, I will give\nmy standard disclaimer, which is that the views I share today are my own and not the\nviews of my colleagues on the Board or at other Reserve Banks.\nI like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions that support\na vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all – not just for some people.\nThat is why it is essential for us to connect with and learn from people across the\nBoston Fed’s district, which encompasses most of New England, about their\nexperiences, challenges, and opportunities.\nThe Boston Fed prioritizes engaging with the community in a variety of ways,\nfrom collaborations, to serving as a nonpartisan resource, to convenings such as this\none. And since I started in this job nearly 11 months ago, being out and meeting with\nstakeholders across the region has been a key focus.\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe perspectives you’ve all shared today augment what I have heard from my\ntravels. Community leaders in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont,\nMassachusetts, and just last week, New Hampshire, have raised many recurring\nthemes – in particular, the toll from high inflation, challenges related to worker\navailability and retention, and barriers to full participation in the region’s economy and\njob market, such as the availability and cost of housing, and childcare.\nYour input today helps to us to flesh out what we learn from the statistical data,\nand to connect quantitative analyses to the real-world experiences of people.\nThis is particularly relevant as we, at the Fed, focus on our dual mandate from\nCongress: price stability and maximum employment. We are intent on reducing inflation\nthat is simply too high and impacting everyone, with particular challenges for those with\nlower incomes. I’ll note that price stability is a foundation for maximum employment that\nis sustainable - a robust job market with opportunities for all.\nOur next monetary policy meeting is in mid-June. And as I shared in remarks\nlast week to an audience at the Community College of Rhode Island, I believe it is\nimportant to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of all the\navailable information. 2\nPolicymakers continue to monitor a wide range of data – about price\ndevelopments, labor markets, financial conditions and more. And we will continue to\nhave conversations such as these with business and community leaders, in order to\ncomplement the economic data and to help us more comprehensively assess how the\neconomy is doing.\nHere at the Boston Fed, the insights we’re gathering today will broadly help to\ninform the wide range of work we do to advance our commitment to promoting a strong\nand equitable economy.\nAgain, I want to thank you for your active participation. We have enjoyed this\nFedListens event and look forward to continuing these conversations with many of you\nover lunch, and to future opportunities to engage.\n###\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFor more about the FedListens series, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategytools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm\n1\n\nSee May 25, 2023 remarks by Susan M.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. Collins wanted her first visit to an educational institution as Boston Fed president to be at a\ncommunity college – because they provide affordable, accessible higher education to learners\nfrom all backgrounds. Community colleges play a crucial role in helping students develop the\nnecessary skills to contribute in the economy of today and of the future. It is essential that our\neconomy has opportunities for everyone to thrive, and that makes community colleges particularly\nimportant.\n2. High inflation impacts everyone – and we need to make sure it does not become entrenched.\nAn inflation rate that is low and predictable is needed for fostering conditions that promote a\nvibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable over\ntime. This is why it is so important to remain resolute in bringing inflation back down to the Fed’s 2\npercent target in a reasonable amount of time.\n3. While inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation. Collins believes\nwe may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising interest rates. This will\nprovide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the\ngeneral tightening of credit conditions on economic activity. However, it is important to make\neach policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of information available at the time.\n4. Collins noted the breadth of ways the Fed advances its mission – e.g., providing back-end\ninfrastructure that underpins the financial system that people and organizations depend on;\nsupervising banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment and serving\nas a “lender of last resort”; working to support community economic development and identify\nimpediments to participation in the job market and economy; and conducting economic research\nand analysis to support monetary policymaking, in pursuit of the dual mandate from Congress to\npromote price stability and maximum employment.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. It is truly a pleasure to be here with you today, at CCRI, the\nCommunity College of Rhode Island.\nSince I started in this job about 10 months ago, being out and meeting with\nstakeholders has been a key focus. I like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to\nfoster conditions supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all. So it is\nessential for us to connect with and learn from people across the Boston Fed’s district\n(which is essentially New England) – about their experiences, challenges, and\nopportunities.\nMy initial remarks today revolve around what we at the Fed are doing, and you at\nCCRI are doing, to support a vibrant and inclusive economy that works for all.\nGiven my background as a professor, dean, and provost, I’ve been fortunate to\nreceive speaking invitations at a number of educational institutions. But this is the first\ntalk at an educational institution that I am giving as president of the Boston Fed,\nbecause I wanted my first visit with students, and faculty to be at a community college.\n\nOverview\nI would like to touch briefly on three things – and then look forward to a\nconversation with President Hughes, and to questions from all of you:\n•\n\nFirst, I want to highlight why I wanted to prioritize speaking at a community\ncollege like CCRI; and why community colleges, and all of you engaged with\nthem, are so important to our economy and society.\n\n•\n\nThen, I’ll talk briefly about the range of things we do at the Federal Reserve, to\nadvance our mission.\n\n•\n\nAnd finally, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned from my own career path,\nin case my experiences may be helpful to you.\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nBut before I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own\nviews; I’m not speaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at\nthe Board of Governors.\n\nThe Importance of Community Colleges\nCommunity colleges provide affordable, accessible higher education to millions\nof learners from all backgrounds. They support a wide range of needs for students,\nemployers and communities, and provide opportunities for upward mobility. 1 And\ncommunity college students exemplify working hard, juggling multiple responsibilities,\nand developing additional skills to contribute to the economies of today and the future.\nI would especially like to acknowledge the cohort of entrepreneurs and owners of\nsmall businesses who are here today. You play such an important role in a vibrant\neconomy.\nAs I travel around New England and talk with employers, one of the most\nprevalent themes is the need for skilled personnel, to power their organizations and\nindustries. Indeed, our region’s labor market provides opportunities for good jobs,\nenabling people to prosper and thrive. But those jobs require evolving sets of skills and\nexpertise. So I congratulate all of you for investing in yourselves and your skills here at\nCCRI. Doing so is not only good for you; it also helps the organizations, households,\nand communities that make up our economy.\nAs a policymaker, it is critical to me that our economy provides opportunities for\neveryone, not just for some. This makes community colleges, like CCRI, particularly\nimportant in the broader higher education and skill-development landscape.\n\nSee the recent study by Jack Mountjoy, “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility,” American\nEconomic Review, 2022, 112(8): 2580–2630.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt the Fed, part of our mandate from Congress is to use our tools to maximize\nemployment. So if things like a lack of childcare, or insufficient housing, prevent some\npeople from participating in the job market and economy, we need to study those\nimpediments. We need to deepen our understanding of the obstacles and help explore\nways, locally and more broadly, that progress can be made to address them. The\nBoston Fed has been doing this through our research-based Working Places program,\nin locations across New England – including Cranston, Newport, and Providence here in\nRhode Island. 2 Working Places encourages and fosters local, cross-sector\ncollaboration to identify issues and work on solutions to address complex economic\nproblems.\n\nOur Roles at the Federal Reserve\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of activities is much more extensive than\nmany realize – and I’d like to speak briefly about the breadth of ways we, at the Fed,\nwork to achieve our mission.\nThe Fed, which is the U.S. central bank, was created almost 110 years ago by\nCongress. I’ll mention four of our key roles:\n•\n\nWe provide a lot of back-end infrastructure that underpins the financial system,\nsupporting stable and reliable payments that people and organizations\nthroughout the economy depend on. Think cash, direct deposits, wire transfers,\nand a new service we’re about to unveil, FedNowSM instant payments. 3 It is the\nfirst new payments “rail” the Fed has built in 50 years, and it will allow individuals\n\n2\n\nLearn more about these efforts at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n\n3\n\nLearn more about the FedNow service at https://explore.fednow.org/\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand businesses to send and receive instant payments and have access to the\nfunds immediately.\n•\n\nSecond, we supervise some of the country’s banks for safety, soundness, fair\nlending, and community reinvestment. And we serve as a “lender of last resort”\nto the financial system, to ensure liquidity and to support financial stability.\n\n•\n\nThird, we work to support community economic development initiatives, like the\nWorking Places program I just mentioned.\n\n•\n\nFourth, and importantly, we conduct monetary policy in the pursuit of our dual\nmandate from Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment. I’ll\nsay a bit more about this area of our work.\nTo me, maximum employment refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job\n\nopportunities for all. Price stability means inflation that is low and stable enough that it\nis not on people’s minds. Inflation at 2 percent, the target the Fed has defined,\naccomplishes that goal. But as you all know, prices have been rising more rapidly than\nthat, so much attention has been focused on inflation. In my conversations with people\nacross the region, I have heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost\nincreases, and from workers having to take on additional jobs given rising prices on\nnecessities.\nThese and other discussions are a constant reminder that inflation impacts\neveryone, and is particularly challenging for those with lower incomes. The Federal\nReserve has been responding forcefully to make sure that high inflation does not\nbecome entrenched.\nI’ll note that wage increases that are simply chasing higher prices do not make\nworkers better off, they just fuel more inflation. What matters for workers are gains in\ninflation-adjusted, or real wages.\nThus, I see the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – stable prices and\nmaximum employment – as intertwined, especially over the medium and longer term.\nLow, predictable inflation is needed for fostering conditions that promote a vibrant,\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nresilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable\nover time. This is a key reason why it is so important for us to remain resolute in\nbringing inflation back down to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.\nThere are several factors behind the inflation we’ve been experiencing, but\nultimately it reflects demand outpacing supply, resulting in pressures on wages and\nprices that fuel inflation. The Fed raising interest rates is intended to slow spending,\ncool the labor market, and bring demand back into alignment with supply.\nSince March 2022, the Fed has raised rates from near zero to just over 5 percent\n– with the most recent increase occurring just a few weeks ago. And recent stresses in\nthe banking system are likely to further tighten credit conditions for businesses and\nconsumers, also cooling demand.\nWhile inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation. I\nbelieve we may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising\ninterest rates. This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the\nactions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic\nactivity. However, I also believe it is important to make each policy decision based on a\nwholistic assessment of information available at the time – and the next policy meeting\nwill be in mid-June. In the meantime, we continue to monitor a wide range of data –\nabout price developments, labor markets, financial conditions and more – to evaluate\nhow the economy is doing.\n\nMy Own Path, and Some Lessons Along the Way\nLet me turn, for a moment, to my own career path. I’ll just mention a few\ndimensions of my journey, and then wrap up.\nFirst, I was inspired to be a lifelong learner by my parents and relatives. While I\nrealize that not everyone has that support, I hope you will be inspired by those you meet\nhere at CCRI, to never stop learning and developing your skills. The pace of change in\nour economy, and the skills it requires, make that essential.\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDuring my studies, I encountered instructors who were inspiring, challenging …\nor both. It was the challenging ones who taught me the most. I encourage you to seek\nout opportunities to stretch yourself – maybe by asking questions, to be sure you have\nmastered a subject, or taking a class here at CCRI that will push you. I know many\npeople around you at CCRI care about your success – so, seek out those who will\ninspire and challenge you.\nAnd throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have encouragement from\nfriends and family – especially my husband and (now adult) children. Again, I realize\nnot everyone is so fortunate. I’ll just say that it is vital to have allies and supporters as\nyou do the hard work of juggling everything, both while attending CCRI and in the\nfuture. So I encourage you to seek out allies … and perhaps most importantly, to be an\nally. I’ve found that working together, building networks and partnerships, is a key to\nsuccess – whether in school, or in a new job, or as President of the Boston Fed.\n\nConcluding Observations\nLet me close by encouraging you to keep at what you are doing here at CCRI,\nand to embrace being a lifelong learner. I have such respect for all of you, who are\nworking so hard to broaden your skills. You’re building a more prosperous future for\nyourselves, and also for our economy.\nIndeed, as someone who thinks about and works on our economy all the time, I\nwant to thank you, students – and your instructors and supporters as well as the staff\nhere at CCRI – for helping to build a vibrant, high-skill, inclusive economy – in Rhode\nIsland and beyond.\nWith that, thank you again for having me here today. I look forward to questions\nand conversation.\n\n6\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nAt the 39th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nMarch 30, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. Financial stability: The banking system is strong and resilient, with well-capitalized\ninstitutions and ample liquidity. Recent difficulties, and the decisive actions taken in\nresponse, demonstrate commitment to use all our tools to ensure the financial system\nremains safe and sound, and to take action as needed. The lessons learned from the\nreview underway will be welcome, and instructive.\n2. Monetary policy and the macroeconomic outlook: Recent data show that inflation is still\ntoo high, continuing to take a toll on households and firms. I anticipate that some additional\npolicy tightening will be needed as we follow through on our commitment to price stability.\nHowever, while recognizing the risks and uncertainties to the outlook, I remain optimistic\nthere is a path to bringing inflation down without a significant downturn, because of the\nresilience I see in the economy.\n3. Financial infrastructure and payments services: The Fed provides essential financial\ninfrastructure the economy depends on – and innovates to meet evolving needs and\npreferences. In today’s world, people want quick and easy ways to make payments\ninstantly, with immediate access to those funds. To help financial institutions offer instant\npayment services to their customers around the clock, we will launch the FedNowSM\nService in July.\n4. Community economic development and opportunity: While the Fed’s activities are\nbroad, they all relate to supporting a vibrant and inclusive economy, consistent with our\nmandates – stable prices and maximum employment. That’s why, for example, we have for\ndecades studied the gaps and disparities behind the aggregates. It is also why the Boston\nFed is helping spark collaboration among the private, public, nonprofit, and philanthropic\nsectors, to find local solutions to complex economic problems in urban and rural areas.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. It is truly a pleasure to be with you today. I thank NABE for the\ninvitation, and Elaine Buckberg for moderating the discussion.\nMy thanks to all of you, for being here, and for the work you do – using the tools\nand insights from economics to support your organizations, and our economy.\nBy way of introduction, I am honored to serve as an economic policymaker at the\nFederal Reserve. It is a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity – and I am\ncommitted to an inclusive approach to service in the public interest.\nBefore turning to questions, I will share some perspectives from my first nine\nmonths as a Fed president and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant. I’ll\ncover some obvious topics (financial stability, monetary policy, and the macroeconomy).\nI’ll also touch very briefly on some things about the Fed that get less attention (including\npayments infrastructure and supporting economic resurgence). When you think about\nthe economy – as those in this room do, all the time – recognizing the breadth of the\nFed’s work is important, because it all connects to our mandate and mission, and to our\noverarching goal of a vibrant, inclusive economy with opportunities for all.\nFirst, I’ll give my standard disclaimer: These perspectives are my own. I am not\nspeaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.\nMonetary Policy, and the Macroeconomic Outlook\nInflation remains too high, and recent indicators reinforce my view that there is\nmore work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target associated with price\nstability. I’ll say more about why this is so important, in a moment.\nOur banking system is strong and resilient, with well-capitalized institutions and\nample liquidity. The banking industry plays an important role in the economy – banks of\nall sizes are important for meeting saving and credit needs across communities.\nHowever, recent bank failures underscore how difficulties in just a few institutions have\nthe potential to undermine confidence in the entire banking system.\nThe Federal Reserve, in concert with the Treasury and FDIC, took decisive\nactions to strengthen the public’s confidence in the U.S. banking system and to protect\nthe U.S. economy. I note that while these actions assisted depositors of the failed\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbanks, shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders were not protected, and the\nbanks’ senior management were removed. Vice Chair Barr has a comprehensive review\nunderway to determine what went wrong and whether changes are needed. We will\ntake what is learned to heart and strengthen practices accordingly – consistent with our\nmission to ensure a safe, sound, and stable banking system supporting a healthy\neconomy for all. 1\nThe Federal Reserve continues to monitor financial conditions closely, and is\nprepared to use all tools at its disposal in keeping the banking system safe and sound.\nI will now turn to monetary policy, mindful of course that challenges to financial\nstability – and credit conditions generally – have implications for the macroeconomy and\nby extension, for policy.\nIn March of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began\nraising interest rates to bring inflation down. But despite progress, inflation remains too\nhigh, and there is more work to do to restore price stability.\nWhy is the inflation fight so important? The starting place is the Fed’s dual\nmandate from Congress, for price stability and maximum employment – representing\nstrong and stable economic conditions that benefit everyone.\nHigh inflation creates hardship for all, particularly those at the lower end of the\nincome distribution who can least afford price increases – especially for essentials such\n\n1 See the Joint Statement describing “actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon\nValley Bank…in a manner that fully protects all depositors,” emphasizing “No losses associated with the\nresolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer”, and continuing “We are also announcing\na similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank … which was closed today by its state chartering\nauthority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley\nBank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not\nbe protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to\nsupport uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to\neligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their\ndepositors.” (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm). Also\nnote the announcements that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is leading a review of the\nsupervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, in light of its failure\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230313a.htm), and of coordinated\ncentral bank action to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230319a.htm).\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nas food, housing, and transportation. Inflation also complicates investment and planning\ndecisions for firms throughout the economy.\nI lead the Fed’s First District, which covers most of New England, and as I meet\nwith constituents, many highlight the challenges they face from inflation. In Vermont\nearlier this month, I heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost\nincreases, parents having to take on second jobs given rising prices on necessities, and\npeople unable to accept attractive jobs because living costs are rising too fast where the\njob is located.\nImportantly, the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – price stability and\nmaximum employment – are intertwined. Low, predictable inflation is an important\nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. Price stability is\nessential for a well-functioning economy and labor market.\nInflation reflects a gap between demand and supply, resulting in pressures that\nfuel wage and price increases. In raising interest rates, the Fed intends to slow demand,\ncool a still-hot labor market, and bring demand and supply back into sustainable\nalignment.\nSince March, the FOMC raised rates from near zero to the range of 4.75 to 5\npercent. After initial, expeditious moves, recent increments have been small and\ndeliberate – which in my view is appropriate as we approach a level that is sufficiently\nrestrictive.\nThe recent data show signs of more underlying strength in the economy than\nmany anticipated. The unemployment rate remains at historically low levels, job growth\nremains robust, and spending indicators through February were stronger than expected.\nThis strength might reflect the fact that policy did not enter fully restrictive territory until\nthe second half of 2022, and it may be too soon to see its full effects on real activity.\nBut special factors may also have limited the impact of policy actions thus far,\nrelative to historic norms. On the household side, a sizable amount of “excess” savings\naccumulated during the pandemic remains – although this is less evident at the lower\nend of the income distribution, where some signs of stress are emerging. On the firm\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nside, balance sheets also remain quite strong overall, limiting the need for external\nfinance.\nSustained household and business spending, and limited pickup in labor supply,\nhelp explain why the labor market remains robust. But there are some emerging signs\nof slowing labor demand. In particular, a large portion of the recent strength in payrolls\ncomes from sectors that were hit especially hard early in the pandemic – such as leisure\nand accommodation, and health care – and faced significant hiring challenges in the\nrecovery. As this “catching up” process ends, I expect more moderation in hiring, which\nshould help to relieve wage pressures. 2 Here, it is important to note that workers do not\nbenefit from nominal wage gains that are eroded by too-high inflation – what matters for\nworkers are gains in real wages.\nWhile we may be seeing some initial signs of wage moderation, more will be\nneeded for a sustained improvement in price inflation. In determining whether inflation is\nmoving toward target in a reasonable amount of time, it is informative to look separately\nat three key components.\n\n\nFirst, core goods price inflation has slowed, but a full passthrough of supply chain\nimprovements and lower input costs to goods prices will take more time.\n\n\n\nSecond, shelter inflation remains quite high. Slowing growth in new rents (with\nactual declines in some areas for rents and house prices) should feed through\ninto lower shelter inflation in the coming quarters.\n\n\n\nBut, third, services inflation excluding shelter, which tends to be closely tied to\nlabor costs, remains particularly elevated and will require wage pressures to\nease more.\n\nThe recent slowdown in job quits is another potential sign of slowing labor demand. In addition, crossstate data suggest that wage inflation tends to be more strongly correlated with quits than vacancies,\nimplying that the slowdown in quits may help to ease wage pressures despite vacancies remaining\nelevated. Wage inflation, however, also continues to be highly correlated with unemployment, suggesting\nthat at least some rise in unemployment rate will be needed to bring about a more significant decline in\nwage growth.\n2\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn all, the challenge ahead lies in determining the level and path of the federal\nfunds rate to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable amount of time, without undue\nlabor market disruptions.\nAs I noted earlier, recent financial sector stress has added to this challenge by\nincreasing the uncertainty around appropriate monetary policy. While the banking\nsystem remains strong and resilient, recent developments will likely lead banks to take a\nsomewhat more conservative outlook and tighten lending standards, thus contributing to\nslowing the economy and reducing inflationary pressures. These developments may\npartially offset the need for additional rate increases.\nWhile recognizing the heightened uncertainty, I believe staying the course with a\none-quarter-percent increase in the policy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting was\nappropriate. Similarly, given current information, I see the median federal funds rate\npath for 2023 in last week’s Summary of Economic Projections from Fed policymakers\n(the SEP) 3 as reasonably balancing the risk of monetary policy not being restrictive\nenough to bring inflation down, and the risk that activity slows by more than needed to\naddress elevated price pressures.\nSimilar to the SEP median, I currently anticipate some modest additional policy\ntightening, and then holding through the end of this year. Of course, I’ll be carefully\nwatching a range of indicators including data on inflation, spending, labor markets, and\nfinancial conditions.\nOverall, I continue to be what I call a “realistic optimist.” I am well aware of the\nmany risks and uncertainties facing our economy – including the risk of a self-fulfilling\nloss in business and consumer confidence. However, I’ve also mentioned reasons to\nbe optimistic the economy may prove more resilient to tight financial conditions than in\nthe past – including business and household fundamentals that remain relatively strong.\nSo, I am still optimistic there is a path to bringing down inflation without a significant\neconomic downturn.\n\n3\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20230322.pdf\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA Range of Activities in Support of a Vibrant Economy\nAs I mentioned at the outset, I want to touch briefly on some things the Fed does,\nthat get less attention. In my view, understanding the breadth of the Fed’s work is\nimportant because I see the Fed’s mission as fostering a vibrant, resilient, inclusive\neconomy; and we do that in a wider range of ways than most people realize – from\nmonetary policy, to economic research, financial stability efforts, community\ndevelopment activities, and initiatives related to payments, technology, and finance. I\nwill be happy to elaborate during the discussion, but for now I’ll just mention two\ninitiatives that show the breadth and depth of the Boston Fed’s commitment to a strong,\ninclusive economy with opportunities for all.\nFirst, the infrastructure for making and receiving payments is a foundation of\neveryone’s economic lives and our financial system. In today’s world, people\nincreasingly want quick and easy ways to make payments and immediate access to\nthose funds.\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, the Boston Fed has been leading the\nbuild of a new, real-time payments service, referred to as the FedNowSM Service.\nLaunching in July, the infrastructure will provide access to instant payments for\nparticipating financial institutions and their customers.\nFedNow will offer real economic benefits to the American public, who will be able\nto send and receive instant payments safely and efficiently through participating\ninstitutions – giving greater flexibility to manage money at any time of the day or night,\n365 days a year. We encourage financial institutions across the country join in the\nservice, so their customers can broadly enjoy the benefits of instant payments. 4\nSecond, for decades we have studied gaps and disparities in economic\noutcomes. This relates directly to our mandates from Congress, which include\nmaximum employment. Because unemployment rates that are persistently higher by\n\n4\n\nLearn more at FedNowSM Explorer – Instant Payments Learning & Resources.\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrace, or by place – as they have been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our\ncountry’s labor resources, adversely affecting productivity and prosperity.\nOne effort proving important in this regard is the Boston Fed’s Working Places\nprogram, which touches 30 urban and rural areas across New England. Research\nshows that the “secret sauce” in economic resurgence seems to be cross-sector\ncollaborative leadership from local people, working together to identify issues and\nsolutions. The Fed’s role is to provide a framework for convening and for increasing\ncollaboration among the private sector, philanthropy, local organizations, state\ngovernment, and residents. The program supports efforts by local leaders to help their\nareas address challenges such as workforce development and affordable housing – and\nthe results are promising. 5\nI’ll conclude with a final observation. As I travel and hear about peoples’\nexperiences, I’m struck by the opportunities and strengths in our economy, as well as\nthe challenges. Hearing from a wide range of voices rounds out the economic data,\ndeepens our understanding, and helps us all make progress. My Fed colleagues and I\nwill continue to prioritize this type of engagement, which is essential to our work.\nWith that, I’ll be happy to discuss some questions, with Elaine.\n\nIn a January speech, I discussed the Working Places framework and local efforts to find economic\nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing challenges. https://www.bostonfed.org/news-andevents/speeches/2023/the-national-and-regional-economy-navigating-near-term-changes-and-long-termchallenges.aspx\n5\n\n7\n\n\f",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nsponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways:\n1. Inflation remains too high. I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then\nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time. My views will continue to be based on a holistic\nassessment of available information. And while aware of the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic\nthere is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn.\n2. The root of the inflation surprise was an imbalance between demand and supply. During 2021-22,\nrealized demand exceeded supply, and forecasters were overly optimistic about supply recovering to meet\nthe increase in demand as the economy reopened. The interaction of supply chain bottlenecks and\nconstraints to labor supply compounded the forecasting misses. Supply chains were under strain due to\ncontinued bouts of COVID variants; and later, Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n3. My view is that, in 2021 – in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant\ncontinued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range – supporting the economy\nversus pre-empting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.\n4. Policy lessons from this still-evolving episode include that capacity constraints can lead to a less\nfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment – and this potentially has implications for the\nfuture conduct of monetary policy, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate. Furthermore, I’ll observe that\nadditional wide-ranging indicators can be especially helpful for evaluating policy options in unusual\ncontexts.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIt is a pleasure to be part of the 2023 Forum. I’ll begin by noting that, of course, I speak\nonly for myself, not for colleagues at the Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks. After\nsome brief remarks about current monetary policy, I’ll turn to the important topic of this panel.\nInflation remains too high, and recent data – including several strong labor market\nindicators, as well as faster than expected retail sales and producer price inflation – all reinforce\nmy view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target. While\noptimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn, I am also well\naware of the many risks and uncertainties, including the risk of a self-fulfilling loss of business\nand consumer confidence.\nPolicy actions to date continue to demonstrate the committee’s resolve – and it is helpful\nto see further declines in longer term inflation expectations, consistent with the credibility of our\ncommitment. I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, and then\nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time. My outlook and policy decisions will continue\nto be based on a holistic assessment of available information and rooted in pursuit of the Fed’s\nCongressional mandate for price stability and maximum employment.\nFew forecasters inside or outside the Fed anticipated the inflation surge that began in\nthe first half of 2021, as the economy reopened from the pandemic. Indeed, for months, many –\nincluding the Fed – miscast how high, broad, and recalcitrant inflation would prove to be. Fed\nactions to remove accommodation began in late 2021, with winding down asset purchases. As\nthis shifted to an asset run-off (from our balance sheet) that is still underway, the FOMC began\nraising rates in March 2022. Since then, our unusually aggressive actions increased the federal\nfunds rate by four and a half percentage points in just nine months. These actions, along with\nthe ones I expect will be taken going forward, should bring inflation back down to target in a\nreasonable amount of time.\nWhile I’ll say a bit more about recent policy, my remarks focus on the topic of this panel\n– why were the inflation forecast misses so large and persistent? Examining the nature of the\nerrors is important and will help us improve policy going forward. The following are key aspects\nof my current perspective, recognizing that this complex episode is still unfolding.\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Miscast Inflation Forecast\nInflation has several determinants, but unsurprisingly, the root of the inflation surprise\nwas an imbalance between demand and supply. Over the course of 2021 and 2022, realized\ndemand exceeded expectations while the opposite was true for supply, causing significant price\npressures and much higher-than-expected inflation. I’ll highlight a few important factors.\nThe first relates to the behavior of consumption and gross domestic product (GDP),\nrelative to pre-pandemic trends. Output fell suddenly and sharply in the pandemic, prompting\nstrongly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy actions (from the central bank and the\nfederal government, respectively).\nAs shown in Figure 1, the rebound in demand was also quick, and especially so for\nconsumption. Perhaps more focus on consumption rather than GDP would have helped\nforecasters better assess the implications of demand for consumer price inflation dynamics.1\nBy early 2021, both GDP and consumption were above trend. But although notable at\nroughly 3 percent, even the consumption gap was not that large by historical standards. By\nitself, such a gap cannot account for most of the inflation surge.\nUnanticipated supply shortfalls that lowered capacity relative to pre-pandemic trends\nclearly had to play an important role in the supply-demand imbalance and in miscasting inflation.\nMonetary policy, of course, cannot remedy supply disruptions. But an understanding of supply\nconditions is central to assessing the economic context, developing the outlook, and\ndetermining appropriate policy. And the FOMC does need to respond to supply-driven\ninflationary pressures that have the potential to un-anchor longer-run inflation expectations.2\nThe errors in assessing the speed of the supply recovery were, for most policymakers\nand observers, large and persistent. There were certainly efforts then, which continue today, to\nbetter understand constraints on global supply chains and their impact on inflation. The New\n\n1\n\nThe consumption basket includes domestic and imported goods and services so that both domestic and\ninternational developments will impact consumer price inflation dynamics. However, much of the\nspending in the early stages of the recovery was on imported goods, likely somewhat mitigating the initial\neffects on domestic prices.\n2\n\nSee “Inflation levels and (in)attention,” by Anat Bracha and Jenny Tang, Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston Working Paper 22-4 (2022), for details on how the relationship between inflation news and\ninflation expectations becomes stronger when inflation rates are high.\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nYork Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (Figure 2) is an example.3 Still, it is difficult to\nassess the extent and duration of supply challenges in real time – especially if they depend on\npandemic developments and unexpected shocks such as Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nAnother factor to consider is that the consumption recovery after the initial phase of the\npandemic was disproportionately concentrated in goods, rather than on service sector spending\nthat required face-to-face interactions. This pattern by itself was bound to create supply\npressures, which were in turn amplified by pandemic-related constraints. This dynamic is\nreflected in the chart (Figure 3) showing the large increase in goods consumption and the surge\nin goods price inflation.\nPerhaps equally notable is the fact that, despite the large drop in services consumption,\nthere was little decline in services price inflation (Figure 4). Here, the contrast with the\nexperience from the Great Recession – when the mild slowdown in consumption was\naccompanied by a noticeable deceleration in inflation – is instructive, and again suggests a key\nrole for supply constraints this time.\nSurprises on the inflation front continued in late 2021 and into 2022. The expectation\nwas that, as the economy reopened, demand would shift back from goods to services, and\ngoods inflation would subside without a significant rise in service-sector inflation. Supply – and\nmost notably labor supply, since services tend to be labor intensive – would increase to meet\ndemand.\nReality was a bit different. Services consumption rose somewhat, without a material\ndecline in goods consumption. This meant little relief to supply chains, which were also under\nsignificant strain due to continued global bouts of COVID variants and, later, Russia’s war in\nUkraine – thus keeping pressure on inflation.\nMost importantly, the expected pickup in labor supply to meet the increased services\ndemand has been taking much longer to materialize than expected, creating a demand-supply\ngap in the labor market that fueled wage and price inflation.\n\n3\n\nSee https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/a-new-barometer-of-global-supply-chainpressures/. More broadly, there was an expansion of types of information considered by policymakers,\nincluding an effort to better understand consumer behavior as the economy re-opened by using highfrequency data on mobility and foot traffic, transportation, dining, and hotel occupancy, among others.\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThere are several ways to think about the labor market imbalance. One is illustrated in\nthis chart (Figure 5), which compares the GDP recovery to the employment recovery, again\nusing pre-pandemic trends as benchmarks. Although fast by historical standards, the\nemployment recovery was noticeably slower than the GDP recovery.4 Only near the end of\n2022 did the cyclical position of employment become more in line with GDP.\nThe fact that employment took more time to recover than aggregate demand reflected a\nslower than expected recovery in labor supply, which caused fierce competition among firms for\navailable workers. Given these unusual patterns, the unemployment rate has clearly not been a\nsufficient statistic for gauging labor market conditions.\nJust before the pandemic, inflation was seemingly stuck below the 2 percent target, with\nan unemployment rate at similarly low levels. Perhaps more weight should have been placed\non indicators such as quits and vacancies – but their possible superiority as measures of labor\nmarket tightness relative to the unemployment rate was not clear from past experience.\nAgain, the pandemic was uncharted territory for forecasters and policymakers alike, and\nthere was little reason to expect an accurate real-time read on how much, for example, fear of\nCovid and remote education arrangements would affect labor supply decisions, especially given\nall the uncertainty associated with the pandemic’s evolution.5\nIn sum, an important reason for underpredicting inflation was that forecasters were\noverly optimistic about supply recovering to meet the increase in demand as the economy\nreopened. The fact that both supply chain bottlenecks and constraints to labor supply were\noperating at the same time compounded the forecasting errors.\n\nMonetary Policy in Real Time\nMy comments so far have highlighted the importance of supply constraints in generating\nhigh, unexpected inflation during the pandemic recovery. I’ve noted that there is little the Fed\n\n4\n\nOn this point, see also “A new interpretation of productivity growth dynamics in the pre-pandemic and\npandemic era U.S. economy, 1950-2022” by Robert J. Gordon and Hassan Sayed, NBER working paper\n30267 (2022).\n5\n\nIncidentally, I will note here that it was also difficult to predict that the pandemic would lead to increased\ndemand for residential space, stemming from remote work, which in turn resulted in higher house prices\nand rents.\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncan do to alleviate supply challenges, but that policy should lean against supply-driven inflation\nthat risks un-anchoring longer-run inflation expectations. In particular, a temporary but\npersistent dislocation can increase such a risk.\nIt is also clear from my previous comments and charts that demand played a role in the\ninflation rise as well.6 One question, then, is whether monetary policy should have tightened\nearlier to reduce the risk of un-anchoring inflation expectations and to offset the demand\nincrease.\nSome may say that policy was too accommodative in the first place. In my view, such a\nstatement ignores the real time concerns created by the pandemic; the associated risk\nmanagement required; and the difficulty of inferring, in real time, how quickly adverse supply\nshocks would unwind.\nWhile not involved in policy decisions until becoming Boston Fed President in July 2022,\nI was a keen policy observer. I agree with Chair Powell and other colleagues who have stated\nthat, with the benefit of hindsight, policy could have been tightened sooner. But to me in 2021,\nin the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant continued uncertainty,\nand with inflation expectations in a reasonable range, supporting the economy versus preempting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision. I’ll note that\nmy view was not predicated on the 2020 revisions to the Fed’s policy framework.\nWould earlier rate increases have significantly helped reduce inflation pressures? That\ndepends on how early and how quickly the Fed would have moved. In my view, given the\nsignificant uncertainty that continued to surround the pandemic, earlier action by the Fed may\nhave been less aggressive, taking longer to reach a restrictive range.\n\nWhere Are We Now?\nWhile the misses in inflation were large, key aspects of prior forecasts are playing out,\nalbeit with a lag. With improvements on the supply side – both in terms of supply chains and, to\n\n6\n\nFor a decomposition of inflation into demand- and supply-driven components, see “How much do supply\nand demand drive inflation?” by Adam H. Shapiro, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic\nLetter (June 21, 2022) and “Are the Demand and Supply Channels of Inflation Persistent? Evidence from\na Novel Decomposition of PCE Inflation” by Viacheslav Sheremirov, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nCurrent Policy Perspectives (2022).\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsome degree, labor supply – we are now seeing initial signs of deceleration in goods-price and\nwage inflation. These improvements took longer than expected to materialize but do appear to\nbe providing some relief to inflation.\nIn addition, despite the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming un-anchored,\nthey have remained in check throughout this period. And now that policy is in restrictive\nterritory, the process of realigning demand with supply is underway.\n\nSome Policy Lessons\nThere are several important policy issues to be studied from this still-evolving episode. I\noffer a partial list and reiterate that these are my views alone.\nThe belief that inflation dynamics during the pandemic recovery would remain similar to\nthe 1996-2019 period was too optimistic. Thus, forecasters likely underestimated implications of\nexcessively strong labor markets for wages and prices. And especially when unemployment is\nlow, it is clear that labor market tightness is best assessed with a broad range of indicators.\nReliance on a small trade-off between inflation and unemployment – that is, on a linear\nand flat Phillips curve even at low unemployment rates – implied more willingness to risk\nprobing down on the unemployment rate than may have been warranted. Recent experience\nsuggests that capacity constraints can lead to a nonlinear Phillips curve with a higher slope at\nlow unemployment rate levels. This less favorable trade-off between inflation and\nunemployment has implications for how best to probe going forward, as we at the Fed fulfill our\ndual mandate.\nUltimately, the nature of the pandemic represented unchartered waters for policymakers,\nand as I have argued, supply factors played an important role. Indeed, there may be a\nsomewhat stronger case than previously thought for taking out insurance against adverse\ninflation outcomes, with policy tightening, when there is the risk of supply constraints being\nbinding. Moreover, we have learned that additional, wide ranging, indicators may be helpful for\nevaluating if there is a need for preemptive policy in these contexts.\nIn sum, I believe a collective dose of humility and openness is appropriate, as we focus\non all we can learn from studying this episode. I am pleased to see that work well underway,\nincluding at the Fed and through discussions such as this panel.\n6\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 19, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“The National and Regional Economy:\nNavigating Near-term Changes\nand Long-term Challenges”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nRemarks at the Conference\n“Housing, Place, and Flexible Work: The Future of the\nNew England Economy”\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fKey Takeaways\n1. Restoring price stability remains the imperative for monetary policymakers, and there is more\nwork to do. I anticipate the need for further rate increases, perhaps at a slower pace, depending on\nincoming data, before holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. More measured rate\nadjustments will better enable us to address the competing risks that monetary policy now faces.\n2. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain reasonably optimistic that there is a\npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn. I see ongoing resilience in\nthe economy, evidenced by many firms’ continued hiring plans, and household and business spending that\nis holding up relatively well.\n3. New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to address.\nThis is an opportunity to take stock, look ahead, and assess long-term trajectories, opportunities, and\nimperatives – especially related to the availability of both workers and housing.\n4. The Fed’s mandate and mission involve an economy with opportunities for all – but outcomes\npersistently differ in certain places, and for certain people or groups. The region’s economy is\nhealthiest when it’s providing opportunities for all to contribute and prosper, not leaving some people and\nplaces behind. Today’s conference will explore the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the postpandemic economy for New Englanders.\n5. Since 2014, the Boston Fed has been leading promising work focused on encouraging local\nefforts to find economic resurgence – in smaller cities where manufacturing once flourished, and rural\nareas facing challenges. We call it the Working Places Challenge – and the model is proving effective.\n6. “Working Places” is based on research that showed a key to resilience, through waves of\neconomic change and challenge, is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals willing to\ntake on shared leadership. The program is structured as a competition for grant money (not from the Fed\nbut from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders are building cross-sector vision and\npriorities, and working on them together. It helps communities weave together many small individual\napproaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the system. The Fed hosts, convenes, and\nsupports these efforts.\n7. Working Places helps the Fed encourage economic progress in local economies, grounded in\nour mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price stability and\nmaximum employment – for all not just some. It is one example of strategic partnerships the Boston\nFed creates to improve New England’s economy. Like other community development efforts of the Boston\nFed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and supervision work as we seek to fulfill\nour mission and mandate.\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to thank our organizers: my\ncolleagues at the Boston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center – part of our Research\ndepartment – as well as our partners at the New England Economic Partnership, and the\nDonahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts.\nThis gathering provides an opportunity to explore key aspects of the future of the New\nEngland economy, especially given the pandemic effects that are still with us, and still evolving.\nIt is important to study the shifts we are seeing – in work, commuting, housing, and economic\nactivity – with an eye to navigating them effectively, and ensuring a vibrant regional economy\nwith opportunities for all.\nIn my remarks, I’ll speak briefly about monetary policy, then touch on what I’ve seen in\nthe New England economy during my first six months in this role, and finally talk about an\napproach we at the Fed have found helps local community efforts to coalesce around\nchallenges, in support of economic resurgence.\n\nThe National Context: The Macroeconomy and Monetary Policy\nMy comments about monetary policy and the national economy focus on recent\ndevelopments related to the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustained employment and price\nstability. Of course, these comments are my own; I’m not speaking for my fellow policymakers.\nWith the inflation rate well above the 2 percent target, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (or FOMC) has been resolute in its goal of restoring price stability – raising interest\nrates aggressively since last March. High inflation takes a toll on households, especially the\nmost vulnerable ones. And it complicates investment and planning decisions for firms. Price\nstability is essential for a well-functioning inclusive economy that works for all, and for healthy\nlabor market conditions that are sustainable over time.\nWe are starting to see some effects of the cumulative policy actions the FOMC has\ntaken so far. Less demand (from higher interest rates), combined with lower input costs (from\neasing supply bottlenecks), are contributing to noticeably slower inflation for goods – with the\nprices for some goods actually declining. These developments, together with decreasing energy\nprices, are at the root of the inflation improvement we saw in the last quarter of 2022. But\nhouseholds consume far more services than goods, and services inflation remains persistently\nhigh.\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA key piece of this has been sizeable increases in shelter costs. However, monetary\npolicy tightening has slowed new rent growth considerably, which should lead to a moderation in\nshelter inflation starting in the spring of this year. For services outside of shelter, labor tends to\nbe the most important input – so developments in this component of services inflation are\nultimately tied to the behavior of wages.\nBringing labor market conditions into better balance will therefore be critical to achieving\nour inflation target. While labor market activity has shown some signs of moderating, there is\nstill a long way to go. Indeed, high job vacancies and “quit rates” are signs that labor demand\nremains strong. And while the latest average hourly earnings data suggest some softening of\nwage pressures, labor costs continue to grow more rapidly than is consistent with 2 percent\ninflation. (I’ll note that workers do not benefit from nominal wage gains that are eroded by toohigh inflation. What matters for workers are gains in real wages.)\nWhile it is promising to see the effects of higher rates starting to spread from the most\ninterest-sensitive sectors to the broader economy, more is required to ensure a steady path\ntoward our inflation target. As monetary policymakers, restoring price stability remains our\nimperative. Thus, I anticipate the need for further rate increases, likely to just above 5 percent,\nand then holding rates at that level for some time.\nNow that rates are in restrictive territory and we may (based on current indicators) be\nnearing the peak, I believe it is appropriate to have shifted from the initial expeditious pace of\ntightening to a slower pace – though appropriate policy will, of course, depend on a holistic\nreview of available data. More measured rate adjustments in the current phase will better\nenable us to address the competing risks monetary policy now faces – the risk that our actions\nmay be insufficient to restore price stability, versus the risk that our actions may cause\nunnecessary losses in real activity and employment. I am well aware that, as with inflation, the\ncosts of higher unemployment are disproportionately borne by people of color and economically\nvulnerable groups.\nI’ll conclude my comments about monetary policy by noting that I continue to be what I\ncall a “realistic optimist.” The ongoing resilience of our economy – from many firms continuing to\nincrease their payrolls, to business and household spending still holding up relatively well\ndespite an uncertain economic environment – make me reasonably optimistic that there is a\npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn. But I also recognize risks\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand uncertainties to that outlook, including the possibility of a more substantial downturn driven\nby a self-fulfilling loss of confidence in the economy.\nThese are among the many considerations for both determining and communicating\nmonetary policy. I’ll shift now from national policy to some of the longer run opportunities and\nchallenges with a focus on New England – the Fed’s First District, which the Boston Fed serves.\n\nNew England’s Economy… and the Issue of Gaps\nNew England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to\naddress. The conference today provides an opportunity to take stock, to look ahead, and to\nassess long-term trajectories, opportunities, and imperatives – especially around the availability\nof both workers and housing.\nSome of the greatest strengths of New England can be found in our workforce, and the\ninnovative institutions located here. Our workforce is among the most highly skilled and\neducated in the world. 1 The region also hosts many organizations leading in healthcare,\ntechnology (including biotechnology), clean energy, and higher education. 2\nThese enviable characteristics suggest New England is favorably positioned for the\nfuture. I see the Fed’s mandate and mission, however, as encompassing an economy with\nopportunities for all – not just those with advanced degrees, and not just the cities and towns\nthat are thriving. When we look across New England, we see places and communities that are\nnot fully participating in the region’s overall prosperity. For example, some small cities, and rural\nareas with dwindling employment, struggle to sustain local schools and services.\nAnd we see some demographic groups – particularly when looking by race and ethnicity\n– with lower levels of income, wealth, and educational achievement than their white and Asian\npeers. For instance, students in New England perform better on math and reading tests than\nmost other states, but there are large gaps by race and income. 3,4 And household incomes\ndiffer widely by race. 5\nThe region’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to participate,\ncontribute, and prosper, not leaving some people and places behind. As we head into a future of\nslowing population growth and likely continued labor challenges, we need the contributions and\ncapabilities of all communities and places across the region. So this conference is timely and\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nimportant, as we think together about the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the\npost-pandemic economy for people and places.\n\nWorking Places: Local Successes from a Productive Model\nI’ll turn now to an effort the Boston Fed has been involved with for nearly a decade,\nbegun under the leadership of my predecessor, Eric Rosengren. Since 2014, staff here have\nfocused on encouraging local efforts to find economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural\nareas facing long-term struggles. We call it the Working Places Challenge.\nThese places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural resource economies\nin New England. With the employment decline in those industries, many of these communities\nhave struggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. They face myriad challenges: aging\nhousing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax base, and often high rates of poverty. Of\ncourse, they also have strengths and potential.\n“Working Places” is based on research that showed the key to economic resilience,\nthrough waves of change and challenge, is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals\nwilling to take on shared leadership. 6 This collaborative leadership seems to be the “secret\nsauce” in resurgent communities. The Working Places model helps it blossom.\nThe program is structured as a competition for relatively modest grant money (not from\nthe Fed but rather from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders – now in 30\ncommunities across 5 states – are building cross-sector vision and priorities, and working on\nthem together. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.\nIt starts with teams choosing a shared goal for improving the economy that benefits lowincome people. Many teams focus on improving conditions and capabilities for the local\nworkforce, or for locally owned businesses. If the independent jury (not the Fed!) selects a\ncommunity in the competition, that team receives several hundred thousand dollars over three\nyears (again, not from the Fed), to use in coordinating efforts and creating new interventions.\nI’ll share some examples:\n\n\nThe team in rural Lamoille County in northern Vermont is newly focused on\nresponding to the need for housing voiced by low- and moderate-income residents\nand the employers in need of workers. The county has low-income areas of poverty\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nalongside higher income and second-home communities associated with skiing. The\nneed for housing is made more acute by the influx of new residents – many working\nelsewhere, remotely – and the growth of the short-term rental market, which\nsqueezes out long-term renters. Locals from a variety of sectors are working together\nto move the needle on housing, by experimenting with novel approaches such as\nextending water and sewer infrastructure to enable new development, and creating a\nlandlord liaison to facilitate rental housing for local residents.\n\n\nIn East Hartford, Connecticut, people across sectors saw the need to align job\nopportunities for local residents with local employers’ workforce needs. East Hartford\nis a diverse community. Compared to nearby towns and the state as a whole, it has\nhigher poverty rates, more working poor, fewer with college degrees, and more\nfemale-led single-parent households. The Working Places team focused on localresident job training, local recruiting and placement with major employers, and\nsummer jobs for high school students. 7 For example, the Professional Skills\nAcademy has now trained three cohorts of local residents for placement with local\nemployers, in cooperation with a local college – including relatively well paid, careerladder jobs.\n\n\n\nLawrence, Massachusetts, once a textile manufacturing powerhouse, has been\none of the lowest-income cities in the Commonwealth for decades, with deteriorating\nservices and high rates of poverty. People in city government, nonprofits, the school\ndepartment, the community college, and local firms decided to focus on raising the\nincome prospects of parents with children in the public schools. They provided job\ntraining and wraparound services for more than 600 parents, assisted 200 families\nwith job placements (with an average wage increase of 25 percent), created new\ntraining pipelines with employers and the local community college, and integrated\nsome long-term interventions into the school system, aimed at improving family wellbeing. 8\n\nIn sum, we see progress, and promise. Working Places helps communities weave\ntogether many small individual approaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsystem. It has been wonderful to see relatively limited awards be followed by substantial private\nand public investment, capitalizing on new cross-sector frameworks and creating new hubs of\neconomic activity. For example, in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, work by the local team was a key\nfactor in now more than $100 million in new investment downtown and in surrounding\nneighborhoods. In Massachusetts, the Executive Office of Economic and Housing Development\ncreated the Urban Agenda grant program, modeled partially on Working Places, which has now\ninvested in collaborative economic growth projects in over 50 communities over 5 years,\nincluding Lawrence – and a national funder 9 created a small-city investment fund for follow-on\ninvestment.\nIndependent outside evaluations cite progress such as heightened involvement of\nanchor institutions like educational and health care organizations, and other private employers;\nevaluations also find city government spending more aligned with local priorities. 10 And from\n2011 to 2016, poverty dropped and high school graduation rates improved faster and more\ndramatically in our Round 1 winning “working cities” (Lawrence, Fitchburg, Holyoke, Chelsea)\nthan in the state as a whole and other similar cities.\nThere are important lessons from Working Places. Complex issues cannot be solved by\none sector, one organization, or one person. Successful collaboration requires attention to\nprocess, and new voices at the table to expand insight. It requires the flexibility to seize\nopportunities – and to change along the way, including admitting when efforts need to be\nrethought. A neutral, trusted convener can help. The most successful Working Places teams\nhave robust community engagement, local government supporters, and an urgent shared\npurpose.\nWhile still unfolding, it’s a great story that deserves to be told – and hopefully replicated\nas well as studied.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe Working Places initiative helps the Fed encourage progress in local economies. It is\ngrounded in our mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price\nstability and maximum employment for all, not just some. Like other community development\nefforts of the Boston Fed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and\nsupervision work, as we seek to fulfil our mission and mandate.\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIf we are to move toward a more inclusive economy over time, the capacity for lowincome places to adapt to economic change, which Working Places supports, is ever more\nimportant. This is particularly true in the context of the kinds of changes in housing and work we\nare discussing at today’s conference.\nI’ll conclude my remarks there. We have important topics to cover today, and some\nterrific experts to share their perspectives. I look forward to hearing from our panelists about\nshifting economic conditions, and invite moderator John Ballantine to begin that session.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today.\n\nForty-seven percent of Massachusetts residents 25 and older hold a bachelor’s or advanced degree, the highest among states\n(although bested by Washington, D.C.).

In\nthe wake of COVID-19, the team realized that over 50 percent of adult education participants – largely Black and Latino people – in\nHartford and East Hartford do not have regular access to the Internet, which is hindering learning, the ability to apply for\nemployment, and access to remote jobs.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nOpening Remarks\nat the Bank’s 66th Economic Conference,\n“Labor Markets During and After the Pandemic”\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. The Fed’s focus on the U.S. labor market is grounded in its dual mandate\nto achieve price stability and maximum employment. Restoring price\nstability remains our current imperative as monetary policymakers, and it is\nclear there is more work to do. Understanding how the pandemic is\naffecting employment in the short and longer term, while challenging, is\nessential for that effort.\n2. There has been a significant amount of work on COVID-19 and the labor\nmarket among academic economists as well as researchers within the\nFederal Reserve System. This conference brings together leading experts\non the topic, enabling us to benefit from their perspectives and learn about\nremaining questions to be answered.\n3. Answering key questions about the pandemic’s effects on labor demand\nand labor supply is important for calibrating monetary policy and reducing\ninflation back to 2 percent. By raising rates, we are aiming to slow the\neconomy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. I remain\noptimistic that there is a pathway to re-establishing labor market balance\nwith only a modest rise in the unemployment rate – while remaining realistic\nabout the risks of a larger downturn.\n4. Potentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on the labor market, such\nas increased remote work and accelerated automation of service-sector\njobs, are likely to have differential effects across the workforce.\nUnderstanding these differences is important for achieving the Fed’s\nmission of a vibrant, inclusive economy in the wake of COVID-19.\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome everyone to the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston. We are also pleased to be joined by those watching on the\npublic livestream.\nThis is the 66th economic conference organized by the Boston Fed. And while it\nis my first conference as the Bank’s president, it is wonderful to be reconnecting with\nmany friends and colleagues attending today to explore some very important issues.\nI’m delighted to now be part of the Boston Fed’s long conference series. These\nmeetings foster analysis and discussion – among a diverse set of researchers, central\nbankers, and other policymakers. They focus on complex issues where the work\npresented and discussed can inform, and make a difference – consistent with the Fed’s\ngoal to support a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy. Our conference this year is a\nprime example, and I want to commend our economic research team – led by our\nDirector of Research Geoff Tootell – for designing such a timely and impactful agenda.\nBefore beginning, I note as always that the views I share today are my own. I am\nnot speaking for colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nContext: Maximum Employment and Price Stability\nLet me start with some context. At the Fed, policy-relevant discussions are\nrooted in the dual mandate assigned to us by Congress – maximum employment and\nprice stability. We define price stability as 2 percent inflation. Maximum employment is\nless specifically defined; but I see it as a broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all.\nI’ve noted in past remarks that these two mandates are intertwined. Price stability\nis key for achieving sustained maximum employment – meaning, only when inflation is\nlow and stable can the economy in general, and the labor market in particular, work well\nfor all Americans. Labor market conditions also influence inflation dynamics, as we have\nseen recently with very tight labor markets contributing to high inflation.\nAt the Fed we approach our mandate with the utmost seriousness, and\nconferences like this help in achieving our goals – by providing insights, challenging\nassumptions, and exploring central questions about the economy. And coming out of\nthe acute phase of the pandemic, there are many relevant questions about the U.S.\nlabor market to explore. For instance:\n\n\n\nHow has the pandemic affected job opportunities, and how is labor supply\nresponding to those changes?\nWhich recent changes in the labor market reflect transient, cyclical conditions;\nand which reflect developments in long-run, structural forces that monetary\npolicy has little influence over?\n\nThese sets of questions are important for the key task the Fed faces today:\nlowering inflation back to 2 percent. By raising rates, we are aiming to slow the\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neconomy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. The intent is not a\nsignificant downturn. But restoring price stability remains the current imperative and it is\nclear that there is more work to do. I expect this will require additional increases in the\nfederal funds rate, followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level\nfor some time. The latest data have not reduced my sense of what sufficiently restrictive\nmay mean, nor my resolve. Still, despite being realistic about the risks, I look at current\nconditions1 and remain optimistic that there is a pathway to reestablishing price stability\nwith a labor market slowdown that entails only a modest rise in the unemployment rate.\nIn my remarks today, I will begin with the issue of structural versus cyclical labor\nmarket developments, then touch on aspects of the labor market that are especially\nsalient for the current conduct of monetary policy, and finally consider some longer-run\nissues related to full employment in an inclusive economy.\nStructural Trends Versus Cyclical Movements\nDistinguishing long-run trends from temporary cyclical movements in the\neconomy and labor market is challenging. And it is vital for calibrating monetary policy,\nso as to ensure we restore price stability in a reasonable timeframe without slowing real\nactivity more than necessary.\nChanges in the labor market are typically driven by a combination of structural\nand cyclical forces, and parsing their relative impact is complex. For example,\nmanufacturing employment is highly cyclical, but the two recessions in the decade from\n2000 to 2010 likely brought forward some of the longer-run declines in factory jobs that\nwould have happened anyway, from increased automation and globalization. In other\nwords, structural change can be concentrated in recessionary periods.2,3\nOf course, structural influences have not prevented the job market’s return to a\nhealthy state during ensuing economic recoveries. That was the case after the COVID19 recession, as the unemployment rate quickly returned to low, pre-pandemic levels.\nEven so, there are potentially many long-lasting implications of the COVID-19\nrecession for the labor market. It is quite possible that COVID-19 brought significant\n\n1\nFor example, it appears many firms are still “catching up” to fill staffing vacancies even as demand\nslows. In addition, strong household balance sheets should help support consumer spending.\n2\nSee for example “Why does structural change accelerate in recessions? The credit reallocation channel”\nby Cooper Howes, in the Journal of Financial Economics, Volume 144, Issue 3, June 2022, pgs. 933-952.\n3\nMore generally, fears of increased structural unemployment have often followed recessions, going back\nat least to the early 1960s. In 2011 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussed whether a\nsignificant amount of the high unemployment that remained after the Great Recession was structural.\nSee, for example, a now-public memo on structural unemployment presented to the FOMC in 2011.\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nchanges that bear directly, and over the long term, on the Fed’s goal of a thriving,\ninclusive economy.\nConsider that in addition to a significant decline in aggregate demand, the\nCOVID-19 recession also saw large changes in aggregate supply as firms shut down\nearly in the pandemic. Firms have re-opened, but pandemic-related adjustments like\nincreased remote work and the accelerated automation of service-sector jobs have the\npotential to affect aggregate supply in the longer run.\nAnd these trends will probably have differential impacts on workers with different\ncharacteristics. This is important because the Fed’s mandate is to support a healthy\neconomy characterized by price stability and maximum employment – for everyone. To\ndo so, policymakers must assess which of the labor market changes originating in, or\naltered by, the pandemic are likely to last. For example, there have long been troubling\ngaps in the rate of unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers relative to national\naverages. Beyond their human toll, these gaps reflect underutilization of our country’s\nlabor resources, and adversely affect productivity and prosperity. It is important to\nunderstand the factors behind these gaps in general, and how (and for how long) they\nare affected by labor market disruptions like Covid-19.\n\nParsing the Pandemic’s Effects\nOne way the COVID-19 recession’s aftermath has played out differently than that\nof past recessions involves the relationship between the unemployment rate and other\nlabor market variables. In contrast with recent recoveries, unemployment returned quite\nquickly to its prior rate after the COVID-19 recession and has remained between 3.5\nand 3.7 percent since March.\nHowever, other indicators are now quite different than they were pre-pandemic. A\nchallenge for current monetary policy is determining whether the changes in the\nrelationship between the unemployment rate and other labor market variables stem\nfrom temporary effects of the pandemic, or from longer-lasting labor market trends that\nthe pandemic might have influenced.\nIn particular, both price and wage inflation are now much higher than before the\npandemic, even though the unemployment rate is back to pre-pandemic levels.\nOne explanation for a higher inflation rate coinciding with the pre-pandemic\nunemployment rate has to do with the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation as\ncaptured by the Phillips Curve. More specifically, the Phillips Curve may be steeper at\nunemployment rates near 3.5 percent.4\n\n4\n\nDemand pressures appear much more pronounced now than before the pandemic. With a much steeper\nPhillips Curve at low unemployment rates, these additional demand pressures would result in much\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA key question for monetary policy is whether relationships at this low\nunemployment rate are symmetric. If true, this would raise the likelihood of a similarly\nrapid decline in inflation associated with modest increases in unemployment, as tight\nmonetary policy eases demand pressures. But we cannot rule out other explanations\nthat would point to a less favorable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, such\nas an increase in inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting.\nThe pandemic has also highlighted challenges in measuring labor market slack.\nVacancies relative to the unemployment rate, as captured by the so-called Beveridge\nCurve, are now at historically high levels. One reason could be that firms are struggling\nto replace workers who move from job to job to obtain higher wages. Alternatively, the\nrecent increase in vacancies could signal a longer-lasting increase in frictional\nunemployment, and therefore in the natural rate of unemployment.5\nThese alternative explanations for the recent observed vacancy-tounemployment relationship matter for monetary policy, and how we think about labor\nmarket slack. If the substantial increase in vacancies mostly reflects temporary factors,\nthen a slowdown in labor demand could work primarily through lower vacancies, rather\nthan higher unemployment. This scenario for the Beveridge Curve would be consistent\nwith a steeper Phillips Curve at low unemployment rates – the possibility I just\nmentioned.\nLonger-Run Issues Affecting the Labor Market\nThe increase in remote work is just one example of longer-term trends that the\npandemic may have accelerated, or in other cases slowed. These trends are relevant\nbecause they affect our understanding of the cyclical position of the economy, and also\nbecause they matter for what the Fed considers to be maximum sustainable\nemployment. Moreover, trends affected by COVID-19 could have disparate effects on\ndifferent groups in the labor force.\nI’ll briefly highlight three key trends that we will explore in more detail over the\nnext day and a half – remote work, education, and automation.\nFirst, remote work, while not an option for all jobs, could alter employment\nopportunities at the individual, sectoral, and regional levels. Given all the considerations\nfor employees and employers, these changes are unlikely to apply uniformly across\nworkers and firms. Nevertheless, at the individual level, the ability to work remotely\n\nhigher inflation, with little further reduction in the unemployment rate. In this view, the pandemic has\ntraced out a portion of the Phillips Curve that may have always existed but was not empirically relevant in\nrecent decades.\n5\nFor example, workers may not live in areas of increased labor demand due to a lack adequate housing\nin those places. Although housing markets may eventually adjust, restoring regional balance between\nlabor demand and supply may take a long time.\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncould help people with family responsibilities or physical limitations participate in the\nlabor force to a greater degree. At the regional level, the ability to work in remote\nlocations could help spread the population more widely and limit the disproportionate\ngrowth of job opportunities in high cost, “superstar” cities.6\nHowever, remote work may not ameliorate troublesome geographic disparities.\nRather than repopulating cities that had lost manufacturing jobs, remote workers may\ninstead flock to places with relatively high consumption amenities, which may worsen\nthe housing shortages in those places. And given that higher-income, college-educated\nworkers were more often able to work from home during the pandemic, they may be\nmore likely than others to benefit from a long-run shift toward remote work.\nSecond, we need to parse the pandemic’s effects on education – a topic near\nand dear to me, and very important to the labor market. College enrollment was 6.8\npercent lower for students graduating from high school in 2020 than in the previous\nyear.7 This unprecedented decline could reduce the lifetime college attainment rate for\nthe affected cohort – and was more pronounced among students from disadvantaged\nhigh schools.\nThird, automation may well extend beyond assembly-line and clerical jobs, which\nhave been disproportionately automated during the last several decades, to encompass\nmore jobs in the service sector. The push for additional automation may be fueled in\npart by limited labor supply in the service sector following the pandemic. In general,\neconomists view favorably the application of new technologies to production since\nproductivity growth is the ultimate source of rising living standards. But economists also\nrecognize that there are often winners and losers from automation. Increased\nautomation of service-sector jobs could exacerbate wage inequality.\nConcluding Observations\nThe sessions at this conference will address critical labor-market issues –\nincluding the effect of COVID-19 on labor supply, the future of remote work, the effects\nof automation, retirement trends, immigration, short-time compensation, and new firm\nformation. The analysis and discussion will help illuminate COVID-19’s implications.\n\n6\nA few months before the pandemic began, the Boston Fed hosted a conference on regional disparities.\nThe growth of remote education and work has the potential to ameliorate some problems the conference\nhighlighted.\n7\nA March 2021 report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC) documents\nCOVID-19’s effect on college enrollment among students graduating from high school in 2020. The report\nnotes that the pandemic “disproportionately affected graduates of low-income, high-poverty, and highminority high schools, with their enrollments dropping more steeply than their more advantaged\ncounterparts. For instance, enrollment declines are 2.3 times steeper for low-income high schools\ncompared to higher income schools.”\n\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile fascinating in their own right, the conference sessions are highly relevant\nfor monetary policy given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. At the Fed we are\ncommitted to returning inflation to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.\nOnly when inflation is low and stable can the economy in general — and the labor\nmarket in particular — work well for all Americans.\nClearly, policymaking benefits from careful, ongoing study of all the ways the\npandemic has changed the labor market. So it is a fitting time to gather, and deepen our\nunderstand of the labor market during and after the pandemic.\nThank you again for being here. Now we’ll move into the first session. This\nmornings’ sessions will be moderated by Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes from the University\nof California, Merced.\n\n8\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Perspectives on the Economy\nand Monetary Policy”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nPublic remarks hosted by\nThe Brookings Institution\nNovember 4, 2022\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. With inflation much too high, and job-availability robust, the priority is to\nbring inflation back to the 2 percent target, consistent with the Fed’s dual\nmandate from Congress. It is clear there is more work to do, to get there. I\nexpect this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate,\nfollowed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for\nsome time.\n2. Both unemployment and inflation are very costly for individuals and our\neconomy. The costs for both are also disproportionately borne by those\nwho are most vulnerable in our society, like those with lower incomes.\nReturning to low, stable inflation will set the foundation for maximum\nemployment that is sustainable; and for a vibrant, resilient, inclusive\neconomy that works for all.\n3. Lowering inflation requires slowing economic activity, and bringing\ndemand and supply in the labor markets into better balance to relieve\ninflationary pressures. While there are risks and uncertainties, I remain\noptimistic about the possibility of achieving this without a significant\neconomic slowdown.\n4. The aggressive pace of interest rate increases to date has been\nappropriate, given rates had been near zero before March. Now that rates\nare in restrictive territory, the next phase of tightening should shift from a\nfocus on pace to a focus on levels – determining the level needed to be\nsufficiently restrictive. I expect it will be appropriate to continue raising\nrates, with the size of future increases determined by a holistic assessment\nof incoming information.\n5. As policy becomes more restrictive, the risks of overtightening rise.\nIncreasingly, these risks must be thoughtfully weighed against the risks of\nmoving too slowly and allowing higher inflation expectations to become\nentrenched.\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for having me speak with you today. It is truly a pleasure\nto be hosted by the Brookings Institution for this talk. My association with the Brookings\nEconomic Studies area extends back some 30 years. I have many fond memories of my time\nas a senior fellow. The nonpartisanship, rigor, open-minded inquiry, and emphasis on impact at\nBrookings are values we share at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nI also want to mention my appreciation for David Wessel, and his decades of work\nhelping people better understand the economy and policymaking, most recently as director of\nthe Hutchins Center. As a lifelong educator, I see this work as so important.\nI joined the Boston Fed as president just a few months ago. In this role, I have the\nprivilege and responsibility of serving on the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC), which\nsets national monetary policy – this year as a voting member.\nThe committee met this week. At this time of intense focus on the FOMC, I want to\nshare my perspectives on macroeconomic conditions and discuss some key dimensions of\nmonetary policymaking in the current context.\nBefore beginning, I would like to note that these views are my own, and I am not\nspeaking for colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nOverview\nI will start by providing some historical context for current monetary policy. Then I’ll turn\nto inflation and explore how we got to today’s environment – which is important for thinking\nabout mapping out future policy discussions. I’ll then discuss the recent path of monetary policy\nand explore some of the challenges to determining appropriate policy going forward – and\ninclude some of my own perspectives on monetary policymaking.\nAfter my remarks, I look forward to answering some questions.\nKey Context\nI’d like to start with some context.\nNot long ago, the challenge facing policymakers was persistently low inflation, and how\nto increase it to the FOMC’s target. Clearly, this is no longer the issue. Inflation has surged,\nand remains much too high, with serious repercussions for households, businesses, and the\neconomy.\nCongress has charged the U.S. central bank with a dual mandate – price stability and\nmaximum employment. We define price stability as two percent inflation – a low level, where\nconsumers and businesses do not have to focus on protecting themselves from eroding\npurchasing power. The other facet of our mandate, maximum employment, is less specifically\ndefined. It refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all.\nHistory has shown that low and predictable inflation is an important precondition for\nsustaining maximum employment over time. In other words, the two dimensions of the Fed’s\nmandate are intertwined; they work together in the long run. Price stability is foundational to\nachieving the Fed’s overarching mission, which is a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy.\n\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt the moment, with inflation well above the Fed’s 2 percent target, the Fed’s central\ntask must be to restore price stability. The FOMC has moved aggressively towards\naccomplishing this important goal, but the job is clearly not yet done. I expect more tightening\nwill be needed.\nThe higher interest rate environment necessary to restore price stability has challenging\nimplications for real people. I take this, as well as the costs associated with too high inflation,\nvery seriously. Indeed, policymakers must balance the risk that inflation remains elevated and\nbecomes entrenched in expectations, against the risk that policy actions excessively slow down\neconomic activity.\nThe economic environment is, admittedly, highly uncertain but today I will discuss why I\nam still optimistic about the possibility of restoring price stability while maintaining a relatively\nrobust labor market.\nMore generally, I will also discuss my perspectives about monetary policy going forward.\nWe are moving from the initial policy phase focused on moving rates into restrictive territory very\nquickly, to a second policy phase with a focus on determining how high rates need to go to\nreturn inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent target over a reasonable horizon. This requires a\ncareful, holistic assessment of available information and deliberate actions. I will say more\nabout this in my remarks as well.\nInflation\nI want to briefly review how inflation got to where it is, since that is important for\nassessing how best to go forward.\nThe initial rise in inflation, across many countries, resulted mostly from supply\ndisruptions rooted in repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. They caused commodity\nprices to jump, and the cost of transportation to rise, particularly for imported goods. Then,\nRussia’s war in Ukraine disrupted production and trade for several key commodities, such as\nenergy and wheat.\nOver time it became apparent that problems with supply were not going to fade as\nquickly as expected, while demand was noticeably exceeding the economy’s productive\ncapacity. To restore price stability, monetary policy needed to respond to realign demand with\nsupply.\nAs the acute phases of the pandemic eased, the strength in U.S. consumer demand led\nto a very hot job market, characterized by widespread job vacancies, rising quits rates, and what\nI’ll call “hesitant” labor supply. All these factors had employers competing fiercely for workers.\nThis led to wage increases inconsistent with a sustainable rate of overall inflation.\nA number of factors have played, and are playing, a role in the shortage of workers –\nincluding a population that is aging, early retirements, lower immigration, and some potential\nworkers remaining on the sidelines with pandemic-related concerns. So far, high wages and job\navailability have yet to prompt a more robust return to the labor force.\nClearly, the evolution of the labor market and jobs during and after the pandemic is a\nvital topic and, parenthetically, I want to mention that it is the focus of this year’s Boston Fed\nannual economic conference, which will take place in two weeks.\n\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nReturning to inflation, there is unfortunately little the central bank can do to address\nsupply constraints – whether related to COVID-19, Russia’s war in Ukraine, or workers’\ndecisions about labor-force participation. But monetary policy can influence demand, and our\njob right now is to slow demand, to bring it back into alignment with our economy’s productive\ncapacity and relieve pressures on inflation.\nIrrespective of source, current levels of inflation are simply too high, and are taking a\nsignificant toll on households and firms. If not addressed, inflation will be increasingly damaging\nto the economy and its participants. I’d like to spend a bit of time discussing some of these\ncosts, and why bringing inflation down is so important.\nOf course, the Fed conducts extensive analysis of economic data. We augment this\nanalysis by working to understand the experiences and economic realities of people and\norganizations in the economy. For example, an increase in inflation can reduce consumers’\nspending power – and that problem is more acute for lower-income individuals. I’ve heard\nabout the increasing difficulties that many lower-income households are having making ends\nmeet as costs for food, housing, and transportation rise. The rise in fuel and auto prices has\nalso made it difficult for some low wage workers to accept jobs that require a car to get to work.\nIn addition, many operators of small businesses have told me about the challenges they\nare experiencing with inflation’s effects on their raw inputs and supplies. I’ve also heard about\nfirms putting their expansion plans on hold because of the uncertainty created by inflation.\nImportantly, high inflation also risks upsetting the stability in inflation expectations seen\nover the past 25 years. Without well-anchored inflation expectations (that is, expectations\nconsistent with the Fed’s 2 percent target), the cost of bringing inflation down, which involves\nslowing economic growth and thus lost output, would be much higher.\nUnfortunately, recent data on price inflation show PCE inflation only slowly drifting down\nfrom its year-over-year peak of 7 percent, reached in June. This has been disappointing, and\nthere clearly is more work to do to bring inflation down, as I’ll discuss shortly.\nBut I’ll note that other, related price indicators are providing more encouraging signs. In\nparticular, some global supply chain problems that have contributed to inflation since early 2021\nare beginning to fade. Transportation costs and commodity prices have significantly retrenched\nfrom their peaks, and broader measures of prices paid by manufacturers have noticeably\ndeclined in recent months. In addition, recent wage data, specifically the private sector\nEmployment Cost Index, grew more slowly than anticipated in the third quarter of 2022.\nSo there are some hopeful signs, although not yet clear evidence, that inflation may be\nbeginning to moderate. It is also reassuring that long-run inflation expectations, measured in a\nvariety of ways, remain well anchored overall.\nMonetary Policy Actions to Date\nMonetary policymakers reacted to this significant rise in inflation by raising interest rates\nrapidly. I would like to briefly discuss the recent path of monetary policy. In doing so, I will\nexamine some factors that add challenges to determining appropriate policy going forward.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and concerns over additional waves of\nCOVID-19, the federal funds rate remained near zero from the beginning of the pandemic until\nthis spring.\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSince March, the FOMC has embarked on an appropriately aggressive path of interest\nrate increases, moving the federal funds rate from near zero to nearly 4 percent, including this\nweek’s action. The strong pace of these increases in a short period of time has brought\nmonetary policy from a very accommodative stance in March to restrictive territory now, with the\ngoal of slowing demand.\nImportantly, however, the work to tame inflation is not yet finished. As Wednesday’s\nFOMC policy statement noted, \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target\nrange will be appropriate” until the stance of policy is “sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to\n2 percent over time.” 1\nVarious indicators do suggest that the policy tightening underway since March is having\nan effect. Raising the federal funds rate – which is a short-term rate – impacts the longer-term\ninterest rates that affect people and firms’ economic decisions. The runoff of assets from the\nFed’s balance sheet that was initiated earlier this year is also increasing interest rates at longer\nmaturities. In all, longer-term rates have proven to be more responsive than in some previous\neconomic cycles, and this amplifies the restrictiveness of the current level of the funds rate.\nThis has been especially notable with mortgage rates. They had risen 75 basis points at\nthe beginning of the year, then rose from roughly 4 percent in March to around 7 percent in\nOctober. This has had a strong impact on what was an extremely hot housing market. 2\nDemand is also slowing for appliances and other durable goods that go along with home\npurchases.\nAgain, the path to price stability involves bringing what has been very strong demand\ninto better balance with supply. So I believe we need to see growth at a below trend pace in\ninterest-sensitive sectors of the economy and more broadly — growth that is hopefully still\npositive but down from the rapid pace we saw last year. Indeed, there are some early signs that\ngrowth in consumer spending is slowing to a pace closer to trend. Ultimately, this broader\nslowdown in demand will affect the labor market. Restoring a better balance between demand\nand supply in the labor market will play an important role in reducing unsustainable wage\ninflation, and with it, price inflation.\nIn this context, it is notable that wage inflation is now much higher than it was prepandemic, despite a similar unemployment rate. A possible explanation is that demand for\nlabor is stronger, relative to labor supply, than it was pre-pandemic. Some evidence of this can\nbe gleaned from the fact that vacancies per unemployed worker are now considerably higher\nthan they were in 2019. Another sign is that workers have been quitting their jobs for other\nopportunities at higher rates than before the pandemic.\nWith a very low unemployment rate, and very high vacancy and quit rates, wages were\nbound to increase sharply. I hope it will be possible to see a decline in wage inflation with only\na relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate, as demand in the labor market cools\nand vacancies and quits decline.\nThe possibility of re-equilibrating the labor market with only a modest increase in the\nunemployment rate is one important reason for optimism about reducing inflation without a\nsignificant downturn.\nThere are also other reasons for optimism. Household balance sheets remain strong,\nand there do not appear to be significant imbalances in the nonfinancial business sector. So,\nhouseholds and businesses are fairly well positioned to support spending, and weather tighter\nfinancial conditions – which has not typically been the case in earlier cycles. In particular,\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nhouseholds accumulated more than two trillion dollars in excess savings over the course of\n2020 and 2021, and while they have started to spend out of this stock, the buffer is still large.\nMoreover, many firms may be reluctant to lay off workers they have had considerable difficulty\nhiring.\nAnd well-anchored medium- to longer-term inflation expectations, as I have noted, will\nreduce the extent of the slowdown in activity needed to reduce inflation.\nI recognize that this scenario might sound rosy, and acknowledge that there are a\nnumber of significant risks. The continued stresses and uncertainties of the pandemic period\nhave been extremely challenging, taking a toll on individuals, families, and communities.\nUnderstandably, this has also dented consumer sentiment, which implies a risk that\nexpectations of a downturn could become self-fulfilling, with a sudden curtailing of spending.\nAnd, unfortunately, we cannot rule out additional supply or demand shocks, whether\nfrom a resurgence of COVID-19 or from food and energy supply disruptions due to other factors.\nWe have also seen a sharp appreciation of the dollar, interest rate hikes around the globe, and\ngrowth slowdowns in many nations. These factors increase the risks of a more rapid decline in\nglobal and domestic demand.\nBut overall, while a realist and attuned to the significant risks, I am optimistic about the\npath for our economy, as we do the essential work to restore price stability – which is\nfoundational to an economy that works well for everyone.\nMonetary Policy Going Forward\nGiven all the imperatives and uncertainties I have mentioned, what is the way forward for\nmonetary policymaking?\nThe FOMC’s goal is to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s 2 percent target\nover time, and as Wednesday’s FOMC statement and communications stressed, this will likely\nentail raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and then holding there for some time.\nBack in March, rates were far from being restrictive – they were near zero. Since then,\nthe FOMC has tightened policy at a very fast pace to reach a level of the federal funds rate near\n4 percent. The swiftness of these actions was appropriate, and reflected the FOMC’s\ncommitment to price stability.\nWith rates now in restrictive territory, I believe it is time to shift focus from how rapidly to\nraise rates, or the pace, to how high – in other words, to determining what is sufficiently\nrestrictive. And down the road, when we get there, in my view we’ll need to shift again to focus\non how long to hold rates at that level.\nIn thinking about how to reach the level of the funds rate at which the Committee will\ndeem appropriate to hold policy, I believe it is important for us to consider the various options for\npolicy moves. This will include 75 basis points, as well as smaller increments. I note that a 50\nbasis-point move was considered a large move in the past.\nIn my view, smaller increments will often be appropriate as we work to determine how\nmuch tightening is needed to reach a level of the funds rate that is sufficiently restrictive. A\nfocus on the level (not the pace) is what “resolve” looks like in this second policy phase.\nImportantly, as policy tightens further, the risks of overtightening increase. As I’ve\ndiscussed, I do not believe a significant slowdown is required to accomplish our goal of restoring\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nprice stability. Therefore, it will increasingly be important to balance the risk of possibly slowing\ndemand in the economy too much, with the risk of allowing inflation to persist too long and\npossibly de-anchoring inflation expectations.\nMaking policy decisions going forward will not be easy – it never is at this stage in the\neconomic cycle. There is no one single indicator that will be sufficient by itself to guide policy.\nDecisions, even more than usual, will require a careful, holistic assessment of the range of\ninformation available. Our task is further complicated by some unusual challenges of extracting\nthe signal from what can be very noisy data. For example, demand indicators and the labor\nmarket may send somewhat different signals as the need by businesses to fill vacant positions\nmay persist even with some slowing of demand. The continued above-trend growth in payrolls\nin this morning’s October employment report is consistent with this view.\nIt is premature to signal how high rates should go. However, I will say that the median\npath in September’s Summary of Economic Projections can be taken as a starting point of my\ncurrent thinking, with the possibility of a higher path depending on incoming information.\nIn determining appropriate policy, I will assess how much financial conditions have\ntightened and look for evidence that our cumulative policy actions are slowing demand, cooling\nlabor markets, and having the desired effects on wages and prices. Indeed, as noted in this\nweek’s FOMC statement, the Committee “will take into account the cumulative tightening of\nmonetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and\neconomic and financial developments.”\nConcluding Observations\nTo conclude, let me reiterate my commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate – price stability\nand maximum employment – and specifically, my resolve to restore price stability. Policy has\nmoved expeditiously into restrictive territory, but there is more work to do. In this next phase for\npolicymaking, my focus is shifting from raising rates rapidly to determining the level that the\nfunds rate must reach to be sufficiently restrictive to achieve the desired outcomes. This\nrecognizes that the risks of inflation falling too slowly and of the economy weakening too quickly\nare becoming more balanced.\nReturning to price stability will set the foundation for sustainable maximum employment\n– and for achieving the mission of a vibrant, inclusive economy that works best for all in the long\nrun.\nThank you again for hosting me today, to discuss my perspectives on the economy and\nmonetary policy. David, I look forward to your questions.\n\n1\n\nTo view the full statement, see Nov. 4, 2022 Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement.\n\nHome buying has been slowing, house price increases have been decelerating (if not declining in some areas), and residential\ninvestment has been contracting quite sharply.\n\n2\n\n8\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nMonday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Perspectives on the Economy,\nand on the Opportunities Ahead”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nPublic remarks hosted by the\nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nKey Takeaways:\n1. Policymaking in the public interest: My Fed colleagues and I are\ncommitted to price stability and maximum employment, our core mandates.\nWe are tightening monetary policy, to bring supply and demand into better\nbalance and reduce inflation to the 2% target before high inflation rate\nbecomes entrenched in expectations – for the long-term good.\n2. How I’ll lead: I’m committed to following data without presumption or\nbias as we study the economy. I’ll complement data with outreach, to\ngather insights from stakeholders in different regions and sectors\nthroughout New England. I embrace the breadth of our work at the Boston\nFed, all of it rooted in helping to support an economy and financial system\nthat works for everyone.\n\n3. Behind the scenes: There is exciting work at the Fed to ensure the\ncountry’s payments infrastructure can meet the public’s needs. Reserve\nBanks underpin many of the ways Americans make and receive payment,\nand the Fed is in the process of launching a new, real-time payments “rail”\nthat will improve payments for all – called the FedNowSM Service.\n\n4. In the region: In support of a strong, resilient inclusive economy for New\nEngland, the Boston Fed makes a unique impact through our “Working\nPlaces” initiatives, now in 30 communities in five states. The Fed does not\ndirect this research-informed work; it is truly local. Collaboration across\nsectors and working toward a common long-term vision generated at the\nlocal level, is the key.\n\n5. A unique role and opportunity: I am excited to be back in New\nEngland and working to help the region’s economy flourish. Many\nchallenges are not for the Fed to solve, given our toolkit and roles. But our\ncommitment to a vibrant, inclusive economy and financial system mean we\ncontribute as nonpartisan, data-driven researchers, and as conveners\nhelping cross-sector efforts.\n\n2\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and welcome to everyone joining us. It is wonderful to be\nwith you for my first public talk as president of the Boston Fed. My thanks to Jim\nRooney for his kind introduction, for inviting me to speak, and for opening the\nevent to all who wished to attend or tune in.\nBefore we begin, my warmest wishes to those who are observing Rosh\nHashanah, and reflecting on the year past and the new year ahead. We have\nmade sure the video will be available online for any who could not attend today.\nI’d also like to congratulate the Greater Boston Chamber for its focus on\nlong-term issues related to our economic environment, such as expanding\nopportunities for people in our region to contribute and prosper, regardless of\ngender, race, age, or background. Such opportunities are key elements of a\nvibrant economy. And we appreciate the Chamber, and others, participating in\nthe work underway to assess, and address, barriers to creation of generational\nwealth in communities of color.\nMy comments today will touch on monetary policy and the national and\nregional economy. I’ll also share some early observations about this very special\norganization with a public mission – the many ways we help foster a vibrant,\ninclusive economy that works for all. After my remarks, I’ll look forward to Jim’s\nquestions and those from the audience.\n\nBy Way of Introduction\nFirst, I’ll say a little more about me, by way of introduction. My parents\nwere both from Jamaica; however, I was born in Scotland and grew up in New\nYork City. So perhaps it’s no surprise that I became an international\nmacroeconomist.\nAfter grad school, I worked as a professor, researcher, and policy advisor\n– both here in Boston and in Washington, D.C. As Jim mentioned, I then spent\nten years as dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of\n\n3\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMichigan, eventually becoming provost, the chief academic and budget officer for\nthe University.\nI had the opportunity to serve on the Chicago Fed’s boards for nine years.\nThis really broadened my understanding of the Federal Reserve and the many\nways it can help improve people’s lives.\nThis role at the Boston Fed combines three things about me – my\nbackground as a policy-focused macroeconomist, my commitment to education,\nand my experience leading complex organizations with a public purpose.\nI also recognize that I am the first Black woman to lead one of the Federal\nReserve Banks. I see that as a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity. In\nparticular, it is an opportunity to engage even more broadly with constituents – to\nexpand understanding of how our economy works, and how it could work better.\nI am excited to continue the Bank’s work, including with groups that have\nbeen under-represented in leadership and policy roles. Our economy needs the\nbest ideas, energy, and effort from everyone.\n\nPerspectives on the Economy, and Monetary Policy\nNow I’ll turn to some high-level perspectives on current economic\nconditions and monetary policy. These views are my own; I’m not speaking for\nmy colleagues at other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve with a dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. We define price stability as 2% inflation – a\nlow level, where consumers and businesses do not have to focus on protecting\nthemselves from eroding purchasing power. Maximum employment, while less\nspecifically defined, refers to the broad inclusive goal of job opportunities for all\nAmericans. History has shown that price stability is a precondition to achieving\nmaximum employment over the medium and long run. The two dimensions of\nour mandate are intertwined.\nBut at the moment, inflation remains too high. Rapidly rising prices for\nnecessities like food, housing, and transportation are also disproportionately\n4\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\naffecting the most vulnerable. And rising input costs, and wage pressures,\ncomplicate investment and planning decisions for firms, as well.\nIt is the Fed’s mandate to bring inflation back down to the 2% target. The\nFed’s monetary policymaking committee is called the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC. Actions taken by the FOMC since March, together with\nthe guidance provided in its most recent projections, illustrate policymakers’\nresolve to address high inflation expeditiously, and prevent it from becoming\nentrenched in expectations.\nThe rise in the overall inflation rate after the early stages of the pandemic\nstems from supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, and the food and energy\ndisruptions related to the war in Ukraine – as well as from the very rapid\neconomic recovery from the COVID outbreak, which has resulted in an extremely\ntight domestic labor market.\nThere is little the Fed can do to alleviate pandemic-related bottlenecks in\nthe global supply chain and increases in energy and commodity prices related to\nthe war in Ukraine. Some of the global supply chain problems that contributed to\ntemporarily high inflation are beginning to fade. But of course, we don’t know\nwhen the war will end, or when effects of the pandemic will fully abate.\nFurthermore, domestic labor supply developments are also beyond the\nFed’s control – though of course, we study these trends to understand their\nimplications. An aging population, lower immigration, pandemic-related health\nconcerns, and early retirements have all contributed to a shortage of workers.\nMonetary policy does, however, play an active role in affecting demand.\nAnd demand for goods and services clearly exceeds the economy’s productive\ncapacity right now, which is being manifested in a very hot labor market. The\nexcessive labor market tightness is illustrated by an historically high level of job\nvacancies – currently around two vacancies for every unemployed worker – and\nby the inflationary push associated with rapidly rising wages.\nTo address this situation, the Fed is raising interest rates, which slows the\ninterest-sensitive components of demand. Returning the markets for goods,\nservices and labor to a more stable balance is how monetary policy lowers\n5\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ninflation back to the 2% target. I do anticipate that accomplishing price stability\nwill require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment\nrate. And I take very seriously that unemployment is painful, and that its costs\nhave been disproportionately concentrated among groups that have traditionally\nbeen marginalized.\nHence it is no surprise that, as monetary policy moves to a restrictive\nstance to transition the economy to more sustainable labor market conditions,\nthere is apprehension about the possibility of a significant downturn. I do believe\nthe goal of a more modest slowdown, while challenging, is achievable.\nThere are reasons to be somewhat more optimistic about the ability to\nachieve the necessary slowing of demand without leading to a significant\ndownturn, this time around. Household and business balance sheets are\nconsiderably stronger than in previous tightening cycles, reducing the risk of a\nsignificant retrenchment in spending and investment as interest rates rise.\nLabor market conditions also differ from past cycles. Firms seem to have\ntoo few workers, not an excess, suggesting that this time a slowdown in activity\nmay have a smaller impact on employment.\nDespite these potentially more favorable conditions, there are of course\nalso downside risks to the outlook. A significant economic or geopolitical event\ncould push our economy into a recession as policy tightens further. Moreover,\ncalibrating policy in these circumstances will be complicated by the fact that\nsome effects of monetary policy work with a lag.\nI’ll end this part of my remarks by reiterating my commitment to bring\ninflation back to the 2 percent target, recognizing the toll that high inflation is\nalready taking, noting that it will be harder to bring inflation down if high expected\ninflation were to become entrenched, and reiterating that price stability sets the\nfoundation for sustainable maximum employment.\nReturning inflation to target will require further tightening of monetary\npolicy, as signaled in the recent FOMC projections. It will be important to see\nclear and convincing signs that inflation is falling, and I will continue to assess the\n\n6\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrange of incoming data, both quantitative and qualitative, as inputs to my future\npolicy determinations.\n\nA Focus on New England\nTurning briefly to New England’s economy, the mix of cutting-edge work\nbeing done here, and the smart people who do it, make the region a national\ntreasure and an international powerhouse. Of course, it does have challenges.\nLet me say a bit more about the regional economy – building both from\nstatistical analyses and what we hear from stakeholders. I’m sure some of these\nthemes will be familiar to you.\nAmong the strengths, I’ll highlight:\n▪\n\nThe region’s collective brainpower, diverse and skilled workforce, and\necosystem of innovation.\n\n▪\n\nThe world-class institutions and organizations – in many fields, but\nnotably in education, health, technology, and finance.\n\n▪\n\nOur vibrant nonprofit, cultural, and public-policy sectors.\n\n▪\n\nThe geography and physical features that make New England such\nan appealing place to live, locate a business, or visit.\n\n▪\n\nAnd last but not least, job opportunities have historically been plentiful\nin this region – though with some variation by area. Of course, high\nunfilled job openings factor into the region’s economic challenges, too.\n\nLet me summarize some key challenges and opportunities:\n▪\n\nI repeatedly hear about the cost and availability of housing. Houseprice and rent increases have been substantial. Housing affordability\nendangers our ability to attract and retain the workers needed in the\nregion’s economy.\n\n▪\n\nIn addition, pockets of the region face persistent social and economic\nchallenges.\n\n▪\n\nConcerns about the reliability of key services essential to participating\nin the job market (such as dependent care, and transportation).\n7\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n▪\n\nNew England, like many parts of our country, is challenged by\nreduced labor force participation.\n\n▪\n\nAnd demographic factors, including net aging of the population,\ncontribute to lower labor-market participation and have implications for\nthe demand and supply of goods and services.\n\nThoughts on the Boston Fed, as its New Leader\nMany of these challenges are the purview of elected leaders and fiscal\npolicymakers. At the Fed, our commitment to a vibrant, inclusive economy and\nfinancial system leads us to contribute as objective researchers; and at times as\nconveners, bringing attention to cross-sector opportunities.\nWith the fresh eyes of someone immersed in this organization for just a\nfew months, I’ll share some early observations about the Boston Fed and its\nroles, and what I would like us to prioritize and build on, going forward.\nOne is our tradition of analytical rigor, as we study the economy.\nNonpartisan, unbiased research can be a public service, we hope, to anyone –\nand particularly those whose decisions impact others. With a commitment to\npursuing our dual mandate, I will focus on the data and analysis as I participate\non the FOMC, as a voting member in the rotation this year, and going forward.\nTo me, statistical data is complemented by qualitative information –\ninsights that stakeholders from different regions and sectors provide. I’ve started\nengaging with a range of stakeholders, to better understand the challenges and\nstrengths of the economy from their perspectives.\nI’m also very committed to the breadth of our work at the Boston Fed.\nWhat we do is much more extensive and varied than most people realize.\nThe roles we play are broad, but they all have a strong link to supporting\na healthy economy and financial system characterized by price stability and\nmaximum employment, our mandate. Today, let me mention two areas.\nFirst, there is exciting work underway to ensure our country’s payments\ninfrastructure meets the public’s needs. Reserve Banks underpin many of the\n8\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nways Americans make and receive payment – supporting coins and currency,\nchecks, and electronic payments (like the automated clearing house which\nsupports services like direct deposit, and systems that support wire transfers).\nThe Fed is building a new, real-time payments “rail” that will change the\nfuture of payments – called the FedNowSM service. Our C.O.O. Ken\nMontgomery, and many others at the Boston Fed, are leading the execution of\nthis work.\nThe FedNow service will provide a new clearing and settlement\ninfrastructure, enabling participating financial institutions to provide instant\npayment services in real-time – 24/7, 365. The Fed’s connections with more\nthan 10,000 financial institutions mean this instant-payments infrastructure really\nwill be nationwide.\nFor businesses, it will mean the ability to make just-in-time payments to\nworkers or suppliers, or receive an immediate payment at the time of sale. For\nindividuals, instant payments can be used to facilitate time-sensitive bill\npayments or reduce high-cost “bridge” borrowing. We recently announced that\nFedNow’s release is planned for mid-2023.\nSecond, I’d like to mention work to support community economic\ndevelopment, expanding opportunities for everyone to participate in the\neconomy.\nThe Boston Fed is making a unique impact on economies of smaller\ncities, regions, and rural areas through our “Working Places” initiatives. The\nwork builds on the lessons from formerly industrial areas that adapted well to the\nloss of manufacturing jobs some decades ago. Research showed that for\nresurgence, the key seems to be collaboration across sectors, and working\ntoward a common long-term vision at the local level.\nSo Working Places, which began in 2013, has helped foster increases in\nthat collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local\norganizations, and residents. The Fed does not direct this work; it is truly local.\nWe help convene, catalyze, and connect – and it makes a difference.\n\n9\n\n\fRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCommunities participating in Working Places report solving problems,\nmaking changes that create opportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and\npartners to shape progress. Local teams develop goals and strategies, which\ncommonly include workforce development, poverty reduction, affordable housing,\nand removing barriers to entrepreneurship. Working Places has expanded to 30\ncommunities in 5 New England states.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, at the Boston Fed our focus will always be on serving the\npublic interest. We’ll work in ways both well-known and “under the hood” to\nsupport a vibrant economy and financial system that all can depend on.\nThe challenges in our region, some of which I mentioned, clearly require\ncross-sector collaboration. If sectors work together, there are opportunities to\nsecure a regional economy that flourishes for generations to come. Like so\nmany of you, I am energized and inspired by that prospect.\nThank you for the opportunity to share some of my views. I look forward\nto speaking with you, Jim, and answering some questions. Indeed, I appreciate\ntalking with people around the region, in many different ways – including through\nforums like this.\nThank you.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Montgomery\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWelcoming Remarks and Conference Overview\nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n65th Economic Conference, entitled\n“The Implications of High Leverage for Financial Instability\nRisk, Real Economic Activity, and Appropriate Policy\nResponses”\nNovember 8, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the Boston Fed’s 65th annual economic\nconference – the second of two economic conferences hosted by the Bank this fall. We are\npleased to have our speakers, participants, and audience members join us this week to discuss\nand analyze a very important topic – the implications of high leverage. As noted in the title of\nthe conference, we want to explore the implications of high leverage for financial instability risk,\nfor real economic activity, and for policy responses.\nI am grateful to my colleagues in the Boston Fed’s Research Department for putting\ntogether another in a long line of rigorous and relevant economic conferences. Our intention\nwith these conferences has always been to convene experts who can explore important economic\nissues and contribute to improving policy and outcomes. So I appreciate the opportunity to say a\nfew words of introduction and overview as we open the 65th such gathering.\nI’ll begin by saying the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in\nstudying financial instability risks, specifically the implications of these risks for the real\neconomy. Eric Rosengren, who recently retired as president of the Bank, studied and spoke\nabout these issues, first as a researcher and later as a policymaker, often working alongside Joe\nPeek and his colleagues. All told, the Bank has, for some time, emphasized the important role of\ncredit in the economy and the importance of financial stability considerations in monetary policy\ndeliberations.\nThis focus at the Boston Fed has allowed us to contribute in significant ways to policy\ndiscussions and decisions at some critical moments for the U.S. economy. Two such examples,\nabout which I will touch on only very briefly, are the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19\npandemic. Indeed, in both cases, we had the opportunity to play key roles in implementing and\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nadministering Federal Reserve System programs intended to help provide liquidity to markets\nand support credit availability to the private sector.\nThe first example I’ll point to – the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, which was\ntriggered and exacerbated by a financial crisis – drove home the critical importance of having a\nstable and resilient financial system. Policymakers have since taken many actions to strengthen\nregulation of financial institutions in order to minimize the risk of a repeat financial crisis and\nresulting disastrous collapse in economic activity of the sort we experienced during the Great\nRecession. Take, for instance, the introduction of stress testing for large banks and a number of\nother regulatory measures that led to a relatively well-capitalized banking system.\nIn contrast, over the past decade, we have seen other sectors’ indebtedness climbing – to\npotentially concerning levels. In particular, by some measures, nonfinancial business leverage is\nhistorically high – perhaps due, in part, to extremely low interest rates globally. Our conference\naims to analyze the risks of such high leverage for the broader economy – and also provide a\nforum for discussion of appropriate policy responses targeted at mitigating those risks.\nI’ll turn now to the second example – focused on the Fed’s response to the economic\nemergency brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S.,\nstarting in March 2020, had a devastating impact on many households and businesses, especially\nsmall businesses. Many business owners lost revenue streams overnight, as they had to\nsubstantially curtail or even shut down operations. Millions of workers lost their jobs. The\nabrupt and drastic disruptions, along with extremely elevated uncertainty, caused widespread\nturmoil in financial markets.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConfronted with such unprecedented disruptions to the U.S. economy, public\npolicymakers – both monetary and fiscal – took decisive actions to support households,\nbusinesses, and markets in order to stabilize the financial sector and ultimately help minimize\ndamage to the real economy. The Federal Reserve, with support from the Treasury Department,\nintroduced a number of liquidity and credit facilities to ensure businesses, as well as consumers,\ncould readily access the credit they needed in order to weather the pandemic-induced\ninterruptions. The Main Street Lending Program, 1 one such facility that was administered by the\nBoston Fed on behalf of the Federal Reserve System, supported continued operations of small\nand medium sized businesses, despite the pandemic disruptions.\nThe Bank’s 65 th annual research conference is intended to contribute to our\nunderstanding of how leverage affects financial stability risks, and ultimately the resilience of\nthe real economy – in particular the effect of leverage on key macroeconomic variables such as\nemployment and investment. In addition to a focus on the business sector, the conference will\nalso include analysis of the effects of household leverage on the severity of the Great Recession,\nas well as analysis of how the commercial real estate sector can best recover after the pandemic.\nAnother particularly timely topic to be considered is the likely difficult trade-off for\npolicymakers going forward – stemming from the unfortunate side effects of some of the policy\nmeasures taken to combat the pandemic, given that they added more debt to businesses’ already\ndebt-laden balance sheets.\nI am confident the insights we take from the discussions and presentations during the next\nthree days can contribute to improving the formulation of public policy going forward. Again, I\nwant to thank our organizers, presenters, discussants, and audience members for taking part.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt this point, it is my pleasure to introduce the moderator of the first day of the\nconference, Benjamin Friedman. Professor Friedman is the William Joseph Maier Professor of\nPolitical Economy at Harvard University.\nProfessor Friedman’s work has focused on monetary policy – including the optimal\nconduct of policy and the transmission of policy through the financial system to the real\neconomy – as well as the role of central banks in maintaining financial stability and formulating\nappropriate policy responses to various crises.\nMore recently, Professor Friedman has broadened even further his distinguished portfolio\nof work, with his newest book, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, which provides a\nfundamental reassessment of the foundations of current-day economics and shows how religious\nthinking has shaped economic thinking.\nPlease join me in welcoming Professor Friedman – truly an expert on many of the topics\nthat will be central to this conference.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nFor more information, see: Main Street Lending Program - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n\n4\n\n\f",

But, we are grateful to all our participants, speakers, and audience members for\njoining us to discuss, dissect, and analyze a vital topic – racial disparities in today’s economy.\nI appreciate the Bank’s research leaders for putting together another rigorous, analytical,\nhighly relevant economic conference, the 64th held by the Bank over many years, exploring\nimportant economic issues. And I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words as we open the\nconference.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has long been engaged in studying gaps in credit,\nemployment, and wealth – across race, ethnicity, and gender – with an eye to policies and actions\nthat can make a difference. More than three decades ago, the Bank’s research department\ncontributed groundbreaking work on racial differences in home mortgage lending. That initial\nresearch led to a large body of rigorous academic work that was subsequently published in\nleading economic journals, and also led to important policy actions.\nMore recently, we at the Boston Fed have done studies focused on racial and ethnic\ndifferences in wealth. And we are proud to be one of three Federal Reserve Banks that initiated\nthe Racism and the Economy event series that now has the participation and sponsorship of all\ntwelve regional Reserve Banks, and has seen the participation of tens of thousands of interested\nindividuals across the country.1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI mention these efforts in order to emphasize the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\ncontinued commitment to this vital exploration. While this work and interest is not new to the\nBoston Fed, it is important to hold a rigorous and analytical economic conference focused on\nracial disparities in the economy, at this time. As we have learned from the discussions in the\nFederal Reserve System’s Racism and the Economy series in recent months, the lamentable fact\nis that differences in racial, ethnic, and gender outcomes remain large in the economic data –\nparticularly in the areas of employment, credit, wealth, education, and health. Even more\nsobering, for us as a society, is the fact that these persistent differences in the data have not\nlessened since the Boston Fed’s research first described disparities in mortgage lending practices\n30 years ago.\nConsider these striking statistics: over the past 35 years, the Black unemployment rate\nhas exceeded 10 percent for 60 percent of the time, spending roughly 21 years at over 10 percent.\nAt the same time, the white unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent for just 3 months, in 2020,\nat the outset of the pandemic. The persistence of these gaps also underscores why it is so\nimportant for the Federal Reserve to conduct research on economic racial disparities if we are to\nachieve the full employment component of our “dual mandate” from Congress.2 I’ll say it again:\nunderstanding racial disparities is essential to the Federal Reserve’s full employment mandate.\nOver the next few days, we will have many terrific presenters – as Jeff mentioned –\nsharing their research on racial disparities in labor market outcomes, in education, in housing, in\nwealth, and in criminal justice.\nWe will begin, however, with a keynote presentation, further setting the stage for much\nof the discussion that will follow.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, Oct. 4, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAnd it is my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker, Dean Kerwin K. Charles, of the\nYale School of Management. Dean Charles’ research focuses on earnings and wealth inequality,\nconspicuous consumption, race and gender discrimination in labor markets, the intergenerational\ntransmission of economic status, worker and family adjustment to job loss and health shocks, and\nthe labor market consequences of housing bubbles and sectoral change. He is the vice president\nof the American Economic Association, the vice chair of the nonpartisan and objective research\norganization NORC at the University of Chicago, a research associate at the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, and an elected fellow of the Society of Labor Economics – among other key\naffiliations.\nThank you all for joining us today, and please join me in welcoming Dean Charles.\n\n1\n\nFor more, see: https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/racism-and-the-economy-series-launched\nThe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate provided by Congress is to “promote effectively the goals of maximum\nemployment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.”\n2\n\n3\n\n\f",

Rosengren\n\nFriday, June 25, 2021\n\nVirtual\n\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) Fed Week:\nFinancial Stability session\n\nFigures (pdf)\n\nFinancial stability\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nOur latest information\non COVID-19\nPrivacy - Terms\n\n\fWatch on\n\n5 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric\nRosengren’s June 25, 2021, remarks to the\nOfficial Monetary and Financial Institutions\nForum\n1. Takeaway: Rosengren observed that short-term credit markets\nhave been disrupted in the past two recessions, and significant\nrisks remain. For example, prime money market mutual funds\nand stablecoins bear attention.\nExcerpt on money market funds: “The result has been that [prime]\nmoney market funds have been a critical feature of the financial\ncrises that we've seen in the last decade, and this is a problem that\nhas yet to be resolved.”\nExcerpt on stablecoins: “I think there's a financial stability concern\nthat a future crisis could easily be triggered as these become a\nmore important sector of the financial market, unless we start\nregulating them and making sure that there's actually a lot more […]\nstability to what is being marketed to the general public as a ‘stable’\ncoin.”\n2. Takeaway: Substantial emergency actions were necessary to\nsupport lending during the pandemic, and the economy would\nbenefit from being less dependent on ad hoc measures in\ncrises.\n\n\fExcerpt: “We need a less ad hoc approach to these crises. We need\nto think more systematically about how we can make sure that\ncredit is available, and not only to the largest institutions, but many\nof the small- and medium-sized enterprises as well.”\n3.\n\nTakeaway: A properly implemented Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer, or CCyB, would help avoid some of these issues.\nExcerpt: “I think a well-designed CCyB, which is a counter cyclical\ncapital charge, which builds up capital buffers during good times\n[and] gets released when we have bad economic times, would have\nmade … at least some of those measures less necessary, because\nit would have been a natural way to provide a lot more capacity for\nbanks to continue to do their lending.”\n\n4.\n\nTakeaway: Unfortunately, emergency facilities do well\nsupporting large firms but are challenged somewhat to reach\nsmall firms. Without better facilities for small firms, the\nsituation will increase economic concentration.\nExcerpt: “So, if we continue to have these kind of crises where\nthese kind of interventions are needed, I think ultimately it's going to\nresult in a greater concentration that we want in the U.S. economy,\nin the corporate sector.”\n\n5.\n\nTakeaway: Housing prices have played a role in financial\nstability problems in the past, so recent housing price trends\nshould be monitored closely by policymakers.\nExcerpt: “Around the world, banking crises and financial stability\nperiods are frequently tied to real estate... And, so, I think this bears\nwatching as a potential ‘side effect’ that [policymakers] have to be\nthinking about as we [determine] what appropriate monetary policy\nis, going forward.”\n\nStraight to your inbox: News and\n\n\finsight from the Boston Fed.\nSign up to receive the latest speeches from Boston Fed experts, along with\nour press releases and newsletter.\n\nEmail\nSubscribe\nSee our privacy policy\n\ncollapse all\n\nexpand all\n\nAbout the Authors\nEric S.

Rosengren\n\nWednesday, June 23, 2021\n\nVirtual\n\nNational Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter\n\nFigures (pdf)\n\n5 takeaways from Boston Fed President Eric\nRosengren’s June 23, 2021, remarks\n1. Takeaway: Vaccination rates have been better than expected in\nmuch of the U.S., and that’s led to a more rapid reopening of\nthe economy than was forecast earlier this year.\nExcerpt: “I think the most important message is that we really have\na quite a robust recovery that is underway. The economy is opening\nup faster than we would have anticipated five or six months ago.\nOur latest information\nVaccination rates particularly in New England but throughout the\non COVID-19\ncountry have occurred more rapidly than we anticipated. And as a\nPrivacy - Terms\n\n\fresult, businesses are reopening much more quickly.”\n2. Takeaway: Forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP) have\nbeen significantly upgraded since the start of this year, with\nthe median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee\nmembers at 7% growth for 2021. That is unusually high for a\nU.S. recovery.\nExcerpt: “Seven percent is … more like a number that you would\nexpect from an emerging market, not a developed country like the\nUnited States, and really highlights how strong the economic growth\nis expected to be over the course of this year.”\n3. Takeaway: Despite the positive signs, we still have quite a way\nto go before we reach full employment, given the most recent\nunemployment rate was 5.8%, substantially above the 4.5%\nFOMC participants project by the end of 2021. One reason for\nthat is a slower recovery in public-facing services, including\ntourism, hospitality, restaurants, and retail.\nExcerpt: “If you're working in a store, if you’re working a hotel,\nyou're probably having a lot of contact with people, some of whom\nwill be vaccinated, some of them will not, and you may just not be\nwilling to take that much of a risk for a job that's not paying much\nmore than minimum wage.”\n4. Takeaway: Inflation is higher, but spikes in food and energy\nprices explain much of this, and those will moderate. Increased\ninflation can also be attributed to a variety of things that have\nhappened over the last six months because of the unusual\nfacets of coming out of a pandemic – including shortages in a\nvariety of goods and services that we don’t normally\nexperience during a recovery.\nExcerpt: “Most Fed speakers have talked about expecting inflation\nto come back to 2%. That is my forecast as well, that I expect us to\nbe slightly above 2%. … So, I think the Fed’s expectation, that most\nof the price movement that's occurring this year is not sustained into\n\n\fnext year, is actually a pretty common forecast.”\n5. Takeaway: Low rates and a high degree of stimulus have been\nappropriate, but it is important over time to watch for\nconditions that potentially raise financial stability issues.\nExcerpt: “Housing prices [are] something worth closely monitoring. If\nwe continue to see housing appreciation like we've been seeing, I\nthink over time we'd have to take a hard look to see whether we're\ngetting some spillovers from some of the monetary policy\naccommodation that we're having and think about ways to mitigate\nthat.”\n\nStraight to your inbox: News and\ninsight from the Boston Fed.\nSign up to receive the latest speeches from Boston Fed experts, along with\nour press releases and newsletter.\n\nEmail\nSubscribe\nSee our privacy policy\n\ncollapse all\n\nAbout the Authors\nEric S.

U.S. Eastern Time on\nWednesday, May 12, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRemarks at the Panel Discussion,\n“Central Bank Perspectives on Central Bank\nDigital Currencies”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nHarvard Law School,\nProgram on International Financial Systems\nMay 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThank you for the opportunity to join you for this important discussion today. The topic\nof central bank digital currencies is certainly of interest to the Federal Reserve and other nations’\ncentral banks around the world. Like others, the Federal Reserve System is considering both the\ntechnical and policy issues surrounding all aspects of a central bank digital currency. In my brief\nremarks today on the panel, I will touch on several of these key considerations.\nThanks in part to the lower cost of information and data processing, brought on by\ntechnology advances, payments and payment systems are changing rapidly. In the United States,\nthere has been a growing need to update our payments system to allow for cutting-edge digitized\ncommerce. A major step in that direction came in the form of the 2019 announcement of the\nlargest payments system investment by the Federal Reserve in 40 years – specifically our plans\nto roll out an instant payment system, FedNow, running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and\navailable to banks of any size in the United States.1\nFedNow is intended to be a fast, seamless, and secure way to transmit funds. The Federal\nReserve System is expecting to launch the service in 2023, and I would note that FedNow will\nprovide many of the use cases frequently associated with potential digital currencies, including\nfacilitating digital commerce in dollars. It may, over time, also have the capacity to significantly\nreduce costs for a variety of transactions, including possibly international transactions. In\naddition, a faster payments system – combined with a no-cost transaction account at banks –\ncould potentially promote better economic inclusion in the financial system for many citizens.\nIn addition to the work being done on FedNow, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is\nalso engaged in research focused on the technology related to a central bank digital currency. At\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe outset, it is important to highlight that this is exploratory work, and any decision to move\nforward with such a currency would depend on a variety of factors beyond the technological\nfeasibility and implementation.2 Of course a variety of very difficult policy issues would need to\nbe resolved to appropriately design key features of a central bank digital currency.\nA variety of reasons are sometimes offered for deploying a central bank digital currency,\nincluding:\n•\n\nresolving issues with financial inclusion, such as serving the unbanked;\n\n•\n\nreducing costly cross-border transactions;\n\n•\n\nproviding monetary policy with additional flexibility;\n\n•\n\nfacilitating targeted fiscal transfers; and\n\n•\n\nreducing counterparty risk by using legal tender.\n\nDesign choices would involve trade-offs, however, including introducing additional\ncomplexity that could actually slow the processing of large volumes of transactions. In addition,\none must be attuned to the possibility of unintended consequences, including the possibility of\nrapid movements of funds which could impact financial stability.\nIn part, of course, it is important to understand what problems a central bank digital\ncurrency is being designed to solve, and whether other technologies could more cheaply or\nefficiently address those problems. Nonetheless, work on understanding the technical hurdles to\na central bank digital currency can proceed, while these very difficult policy issues are\nconsidered and navigated.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI am not going to discuss in any detail today the policy issues involved, but I will touch\non the work being done by Boston Federal Reserve Bank that is focused on the technology. This\nwork has two major components.\nThe first component is a joint exploration with MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI)\ninto the use of existing and new technologies to build and test a hypothetical digital currency\nplatform.3 Dubbed “Project Hamilton,” the effort is designed to determine the feasibility of the\ncore processing of a central bank digital currency, while leaving substantial flexibility for the\nimpact of future policy decisions.\nA central bank digital currency would need to be able to provide rapid processing of a\nlarge number of transactions in geographically dispersed locations. We anticipate that in early\nthird quarter of this year, MIT and the Boston Fed will release a white paper that will document\nthe ability to meet reasonable goals with core processing, and create an open source license for\nthe code. Additional work following the white paper’s release will explore how addressing\nadditional requirements including resiliency, privacy, and anti-money laundering features will\nimpact the core processing.\nA second component, and area of exploration, will focus on comparing Project Hamilton\nwith some of the private-sector platforms currently being built, and open-source platforms for a\npossible digital currency. This workstream will examine how each platform performs in similar\nenvironments, with a focus on being able to provide a large number of transactions across\ndifferent locations in a short period of time.\nIt is important to note that there are many complementary aspects of the Federal\nReserve’s work on FedNow, and the exploration of a central bank digital currency. Both require\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n9:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntechnology experts to study and pursue topics ranging from data architecture, to coding, to\neffective use of the cloud. It may be, even, that some significant aspects of both systems could\nbe run on the same payments backbone. Certainly there is much to explore, and the eventual\npayments platform choices are quite uncertain, but this is an exciting area for central banks to\ncontinue to explore.\nThank you for having me join you today.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Aug. 8, 2019 Federal Register Notice: Federal Register :: Federal Reserve Actions To\nSupport Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments, and subsequent announcement on Aug. 15, 2019: Federal Reserve\nNames Ken Montgomery Leader of Newly Announced FedNow Service for Real-Time Gross Settlement of Faster\nPayments - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org).\nFor more context, see Feb. 5, 2020 remarks by Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Lael Brainard: Speech by\nGovernor Brainard on the digitalization of payments and currency (federalreserve.gov)\n2\n\n3\n\nFor more, see: The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston announces collaboration with MIT to research digital currency\n- Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n\n4\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time on\nWednesday, May 5, 2021 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Pandemic Ebbs and Flows: Economic Data, Inflation\nConcerns, and Policymaking”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston College Carroll School of Management\nWebinar on Post-Pandemic Trajectories\nMay 5, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. Even though this event is being held virtually, it is wonderful to be with\nthe Boston College community today. Thank you for inviting me to participate in this webinar\nseries, focused on aspects of life after the COVID pandemic. Clearly, we have all learned a great\ndeal during this extremely difficult period. Now, as we contemplate and work towards a\nrecovery – in both public health and the economy – it is important to keep learning, to continue\napplying those lessons even after the crises fade, and to keep analyzing data and policy options\nwith rigor – and without overreacting to the inevitable temporary ebbs and flows that may show\nup in high frequency economic data. The analysis I will share with you today, I hope, will\nreflect this perspective.\nI’d like to begin with an overview of the main points I will cover today.\nI’ll start on an optimistic note, recognizing that half of the adult population, or more, in\neach New England state has already received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, all six\nstates in the region are among the top ten U.S. states with the highest percent of their population\nwith at least one vaccine dose. As a result, New England residents and businesses can\ncontemplate a somewhat more normalized summer. Indeed, high frequency data on economic\nactivity indicate that air travel is picking up, as are visits to restaurants – suggesting that\nindustries hard hit by social distancing are now beginning to recover. And the New England\neconomy, like the national economy, is in the process of experiencing rapid growth in real output\nand notable improvements in payroll employment relative to the levels seen at the depths of the\npandemic.\nDespite the improved public health outlook and the expansion in economic activity, it is\nvery important to note that significant slack remains in the economy. U.S. unemployment in\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMarch was still elevated compared to pre-pandemic readings. And the unemployment rate does\nnot include the millions who have left the workforce since the pandemic began. The labor force\nparticipation rate, measured by the percent of the population in the workforce, whether employed\nor unemployed, remains depressed. Therefore, while rapid economic growth is very good news,\nit was, and still is, badly needed to offset the sizable shock that occurred with the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe strong outlook for the economy is not just reflecting the progress toward\nnormalization of the public health situation and the resulting reopening of businesses; it is also\nthe result of aggressive government policy actions. Fiscal policy has been unusually stimulative,\nand in some innovative ways, providing a major boost to the pandemic-shocked economy. The\nstance of monetary policy has also remained highly accommodative, as the Federal Reserve’s\nnew policy implementation framework places emphasis on realized, rather than expected,\noutcomes as part of material shifts in policy.1 This implies that current policy will remain\naccommodative until the labor market can consistently help deliver on the Fed’s 2 percent\ninflation goal, as is described in the most recent statement by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).2\nGiven the strong support from both fiscal and monetary policy, some analysts are worried\nthat inflation – dormant for most of the past decade, if not longer – could pick up significantly.\nAs I will discuss today, a number of temporary factors are likely to make measured inflation this\nspring higher than its underlying and more informative trend. These factors, to a large degree,\nare the result of the ebbs and flows of the pandemic, which has produced unusual patterns in the\nmonthly economic data.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIndeed, payroll employment, retail sales, and inflation numbers have all been influenced\nby pandemic-related events. As a case in point, at the outset of the pandemic the contraction in\npayroll employment and retail sales led to a notable decline in prices and a slowdown in the\nassociated 12-month measures of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index. However, as the weak March and April\ninflation readings of last year drop out of the 12-month computation, measured inflation will\nrebound, largely reflecting the reversal of deflationary pressures that occurred in late spring and\nearly summer of last year.\nOther factors are also likely to distort the inflation numbers this spring. Oil prices, which\ndeclined dramatically as travel fell, have increased significantly of late. Pent-up demand for\ngoods has resulted in the rise of shipping costs, and delays in unloading at ports have made it\ndifficult for many businesses to restock their shelves. All these factors will likely result in\ntemporary increases in prices.\nThe Federal Reserve is, and should be, focused on the underlying rate of inflation, and\nnot on temporary price fluctuations, such as the ones just mentioned. In this regard, inflation\nexpectations remain stable, compensation and wages have yet to expand at rates that would drive\naccelerating inflation, and the most likely outcome remains that inflation will normalize close to\n2 percent.\nMonthly economic data can grab attention and fuel concern, so this is an important time\nto recognize distortions in the higher frequency data brought by the pandemic. In short, it will be\nimportant to differentiate between temporary and longer-term trends. Of course, policymakers\nwill need to be vigilant in making sure that the post-pandemic economic environment does not\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbring structural changes that would lead to wages and prices being more responsive to tightening\nlabor market conditions.\n\nEbbs and Flows in the Economic Data\nFigure 1 provides a cell-phone-based mobility index that a data provider calculates based\non tracking foot traffic to different points of interest. At the beginning of the pandemic,\ngovernment-mandated shutdowns and concern with public health caused most of the public to\nstay in their residences, and as a result the mobility index fell precipitously. As government\nmandates lifted and people and firms adapted market transactions to social distancing needs,\nmobility increased. With progress in vaccinations since the height of the second wave in the\nwinter, many people are once again enjoying enhanced mobility. It is important to note that\nwhile mobility has clearly improved, it remains about 15 percent below 2019 levels.\nThis pattern can be seen even more clearly in the next slide. Figure 2 provides high\nfrequency spending data, again compared to the same period in 2019, but this time spending that\nrequires close personal contact is separate from spending that does not. Consumer spending\npatterns on goods and services less sensitive to social distancing already mirror 2019 spending\npatterns. However, spending that is more sensitive to social distancing – such as tourism and\ntravel – remains more than 20 percent below 2019 levels, even though it has improved\nsignificantly since the onset of widespread vaccinations.\nIt is my view that the ebbs and flows of spending sensitive to social distancing have\nimplications for future growth. The impact of the pandemic on such spending is worth noting.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt the outset of the pandemic social-distance-sensitive spending fell, rebounded quite rapidly\nwhen infections were low, fell again in the fall with a resurgence of cases, and has rebounded\nmore recently as vaccines have rolled out. While much progress has been made, one reason to\ncontinue to expect strong growth in employment and real GDP going forward is that there are a\nvariety of industries still impacted by the pandemic. Policymakers expect these effects to further\ndiminish as a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated and the infection rate diminishes\nfurther.\nThe same pattern can be seen in the more traditional retail sales data. Figure 3 provides\nthe monthly ebbs and flows in retail sales. Again, we see a similar pattern – a sharp decline at\nthe outset of the pandemic, a pick-up as COVID cases fell in the summer, a decline in the fall\nwith higher case counts, and a recent pick-up as more people are being vaccinated. In short, the\neconomic data, and in this case retail sales data, are strongly showing the impact of the\npandemic.\nAs previously mentioned, more than pandemic-driven business re-openings are driving\nconsumer spending. Many individuals fortunate enough to have not lost their job have increased\ntheir saving rate during the pandemic. This, in addition to the support from government\ntransfers, was largely because many households reduced their discretionary spending given the\npublic health concerns. As many individuals now have more opportunities to spend, that\nincreased savings represents pent-up demand for goods and services that were restricted during\nthe pandemic. The release of this pent-up demand should lead to strong growth going forward. In\nfact, consumption last quarter expanded more than 10 percent. This expectation of strong\nconsumption is one reason that at the March meeting of the FOMC, the median real GDP growth\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nforecast for 2021was 6.5 percent – a much faster pace of growth than what we normally\nexperience in the United States.\nWith an expected surge in spending, low interest rates, and stimulative fiscal policy,\nsome commentators have highlighted risks that inflation will pick up quickly. Figure 4 shows\nthe April forecasts of the Blue-Chip forecasters, roughly 50 private-sector economists. The left\npanel shows the distribution of their individual forecasts for inflation for 2021. The average of\nthe forecasts is 2.3 percent. In addition, the forecasters are tightly clustered between 2.1 and 2.5\npercent, with only a few isolated forecasters either above or below that range.\nThe right panel shows the distribution of Blue Chip forecasts for inflation for 2022. Here\nthe average is 2 percent, somewhat below this year’s average expectations. However, the 2022\nforecasts are now more dispersed, with most forecasts between 1.6 and 2.4 percent. Seventeen\nforecasters expect an inflation rate above 2 percent in 2022, while 21 forecasters expect a rate\nlower than 2 percent. And, the median for 2022 – 2 percent – is also the mode with 9 economists\nforecasting a rate of 2 percent in 2022. Overall, these private-sector forecasters expect slower\nprice increases in 2022 than 2021. This indicates that many prominent forecasters expect\nsomewhat more pronounced price increases in the near term, but that these increases will be\ntemporary and as such, will not significantly alter the underlying rate of inflation. Still, many of\nthem expect that once these temporary increases have dissipated, the inflation rate will remain\nnoticeably above 2 percent next year.\nI will now spend a few moments investigating with you why this uncertainty is a feature\nof the inflation outlook.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEbbs and Flows – Versus Trends – in Inflation\nFigure 5 shows the monthly changes in the CPI and PCE inflation indices.3 Like the\nspending data, inflation data show substantial effects from the pandemic. As the economy was\nclosing down in the early days of the pandemic, prices were being heavily discounted. As the\neconomy surged with reduced infections and a reduction in restrictions over last summer,\nmonthly prices rose quite rapidly. With a rise in infections as we approached winter, price\nincreases were again subdued; and now prices are again rising as people get vaccinated.\nThese price movements, intertwined with the ebb and flow of the pandemic, cause\nunusual patterns in the monthly inflation data. While the monthly data normally show only\nmodest fluctuations, the data for the past year are quite variable. This implies that annual\naverages of inflation will be impacted noticeably by these oscillations in the monthly readings.\nFor example, as the updated, rolling annual averages no longer include the initial months of the\npandemic, large negative observations will be dropped – which will cause the measured inflation\nover the past year to rise. Ideally, we should all focus on the more durable underlying price\nincreases and recognize that the choppiness of the data will cause some ebbs and flows in annual\naverages, largely tied to what was occurring with the pandemic last year.\nIn addition to the pandemic causing volatility in measured inflation, commodity prices\nlike oil are highly sensitive to current economic conditions. Figure 6 shows that oil prices have\nincreased substantially from a year ago. However, the magnitude of the increase reflects how\nweak oil prices were at the outset of the pandemic. Figure 7 illustrates that both oil prices and\nthe total PCE show significant movements depending on what was happening with the pandemic\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n(a sharp drop as the pandemic began, for example, and dips when cases flared up mid to late\n2020).\nSupply disruptions are also affecting prices in the short run. Many firms are currently\ncomplaining that they cannot get intermediate goods for production, or that it has become\nincreasingly costly and time consuming to replenish inventories. Ports have had difficulty\nunloading ships, resulting in back-ups. Figure 8 shows a measure of shipping costs, which\nindicates that as pandemic restraints have been lifted, the cost of shipping has risen markedly.\nFigure 9 highlights that import prices have exhibited significant movements related to\nthe pandemic. Foreign producers dropped prices as the pandemic began, but with surging\ndemand and many impediments to production arising in many developing countries, prices of\nimports have been rising.\nThe supply constraints occurring with surging demand are particularly problematic for\nsome firms, because of their reliance on just-in-time inventory processes. While keeping\ninventory levels low reduces carrying costs, it also means that many goods may be in short\nsupply in the near term. Figure 10 shows that inventories declined significantly at the outset of\nthe pandemic and still lag pre-pandemic levels quite significantly. As a result, in addition to a\nsurge in consumer demand, many firms are trying to rebuild their inventories.\nIn sum, as all these charts illustrate, we should expect that measured inflation will\naccelerate this spring. However, my view is that this acceleration in the rate of price increases is\nlikely to prove temporary. Toilet paper and Clorox were in short supply at the outset of the\npandemic, but manufacturers eventually increased supply, and those items are no longer scarce.\nMany of the factors raising prices this spring are also likely to be similarly short-lived.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, the debate about whether trend inflation will rise as the economy strongly recovers,\nrepresented by the dispersion of Blue Chip inflation forecasts for 2022, will not be answered\nuntil next year.\n\nPolicy Implications\nThe Federal Reserve should be and is focused on underlying inflationary trends. Onetime, temporary changes in prices should not impact the medium-term trajectory of inflation.\nWhen people expect persistently higher inflation, it would follow that wages would begin\nto reflect these higher expectations. Figure 11 shows that average hourly earnings are higher.\nHowever, it is important to appreciate a nuance: much of this trend reflects that, unfortunately,\nfirms impacted by social distancing reduced staff that were generally lower paid, and this made\nthe calculation of average hourly earnings rise. The employment cost index controls for\ncomposition changes in the workforce, and to date is not showing much change.\nFigure 12 summarizes the outlook for inflation from the Blue Chip forecasters. Despite\nthe ebbs and flows of the data, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 percent over the forecast\nhorizon. This does seem to me to be the most likely outcome, which should allow monetary\npolicymakers to be patient in removing accommodation, until more progress in the labor market\nhas occurred.\nHowever, the pandemic is likely to change some behaviors. Both spending patterns and\nwork environments are likely to be altered by the pandemic. It is too early to know whether the\neconomic relationships we observed pre-pandemic will behave similarly in the post-pandemic\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n11:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 5, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nera. It will be particularly important to see whether wages and prices continue to be relatively\nunresponsive to the tightening of the labor market.\n\nConcluding Observations\nWith a shock as large as the pandemic, policymakers need to be alert to potential changes\nto the economy. To date, inflation expectations and the underlying inflation rate look to be\nstable. It is important to keep in mind the difficulty that was experienced in achieving inflation\nof 2 percent in the United States and most of the developed world after the Great Financial\nCrisis.4 As a result, my perspective is that the emphasis on actual outcomes rather than forecasts\nof rising inflationary pressures when setting monetary policy appears justified. However, given\nthe noise in the data, it will be important to carefully filter underlying inflation trends as labor\nmarkets tighten.\nThank you for having me today, and I wish you all an enjoyable – and healthy – spring\nand summer.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion of the changes to the framework, see: Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\n2\n\nFor more discussion, see the April 28, 2021 statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC):\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210428a.htm.\nEconomists typically measure inflation as inflation over the year – the percent change in either the CPI or PCE for\na given month from the same month in the previous year (as is done in Figures 6 and 7).

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNewton-Needham Regional Chamber\nApril 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to join you today. As we gather today,\nimprovements on the public health front, coupled with fiscal and monetary policy actions, make\nthis a hopeful time to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy.\nDespite continuing concerns with COVID-19 variants, which have contributed to\ninfection rates still being elevated, over one-third of Americans have already received at least\none dose of vaccine, and the economy is beginning to show signs of recovering from the\ndevastating effects of the pandemic.\nEven with this relatively positive public-health outlook, policymakers must be mindful\nthat many businesses and households continue to experience significant economic distress\nbrought on by the pandemic. The effects have, unfortunately, fallen disproportionately on lowerwage workers in industries where social distancing and remote work are difficult – segments of\nthe workforce that include many Black and Hispanic workers. Women and younger workers\nhave also suffered disproportionately during the pandemic. With economic recovery in sight, we\nshould focus on creating a more inclusive economy in which opportunities are widely shared.1\nThere are a number of signs that the economy is recovering, starting with the recent\nemployment report. The employment report for March illustrates the strength of the recovery,\nwith payroll employment growing by over 900,000 jobs. However, the U.S. unemployment rate\nis still elevated, at 6 percent, and many workers and firms impacted by social distancing\nrequirements (or continued consumer fears, at least for the time being) are still struggling.\nAssuming vaccines remain effective against new variants of the virus, the U.S. economy should\nexperience a significant rebound this year, propelled by highly accommodative monetary and\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfiscal policy, and significant pent-up demand from consumers and firms whose ability to spend\nhas been restrained by the pandemic.\nAt the March meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policy-making body, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), the median projection of participants for real GDP growth for 2021\nwas 6.5 percent, with the unemployment rate expected to finish the year more than 2 percentage\npoints lower (i.e., better) than at the end of 2020. Many private forecasters expect particularly\nstrong consumption growth this year, fueled by fiscal stimulus payments and the easing of\nrestrictions that have limited consumers’ ability to spend on certain leisure and entertainment\nservices. As people become vaccinated, domestic travel is likely to pick up. Indeed, airlines,\nhotels, and restaurants that were particularly hard hit over the past year are already showing\nevidence of recovery in high-frequency spending data.\nDespite this very strong forecast, I expect a return of the economy to pre-pandemic levels\nwill likely take longer than many private forecasters expect. With labor-market slack still\nsignificant, and inflation still below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, my perspective is that\nthe current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate.\nCertainly everyone hopes that we quickly return to an economy with tighter labor\nmarkets and a significant improvement in many of the sectors of the economy hardest hit by the\npandemic. A strong labor market and a return to in-person schooling, for instance, would make\nit easier for parents who left the job market last year to care for children (a dynamic that\ndisproportionately involved female workers), to reenter the labor force and find a job. I expect\nthat over the next couple of years, we will see the unemployment rate falling back to prepandemic levels, with significantly improved labor force participation rates.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe current accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy should help return the\neconomy to full employment much faster than in the previous downturn. Indeed, the Federal\nReserve’s revised monetary policy framework puts an emphasis on seeing economic evidence\n(for example, of higher inflation) before shifting the stance of policy.\nOf course, the Fed seeks to avoid a prolonged slow recovery such as the one that\nfollowed the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ensuing Great Recession.2 Nonetheless, it is\nimportant to acknowledge that running a so-called “hot” economy for a prolonged period is not\nwithout risks, as I have discussed many times in recent years. As I will discuss today, it arguably\nfactored into some of the challenges to financial stability that emerged at the start of the\npandemic. Going forward, such issues should be addressed to limit financial markets’ potential\nto amplify the effects of adverse economic outcomes in the future. Today, I will focus on three\nsuch risks.\n•\n\nFirst, I will highlight that in the last two downturns (the episodes beginning in 2007 and\n2020), prime and tax-exempt money market funds experienced rapid, large outflows of\nfunds, which badly disrupted short-term credit markets. (This necessitated emergency\nlending facilities, which were administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on\nbehalf of the Federal Reserve System.) I will also highlight risks in certain open-end\nmutual funds.\n\n•\n\nSecond, many financial firms experienced a liquidity squeeze that led to a wave of sales\nof usually liquid Treasury securities, badly disrupting the Treasury market which is the\ncornerstone of the U.S. bond market.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nAnd third, I will share my view that extensive forbearance for borrowers and banks was\nnecessary to continue the flow of bank credit.\n\nThe factors underlying these financial market stresses, in my view, must be addressed – to avoid\na future repeat of the issues the economy experienced at the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nFor the past year, economic forecasts have been intertwined with projections of COVID19 infections and mortality, which were reflected in many of the movements of higher-frequency\nmobility and spending data. Today, I am pleased to focus for a moment on a more optimistic\npicture – vaccination rates. As Figure 1 shows, in the U.S., 33 percent of the population have\nreceived at least a first dose of the vaccine. Here in New England, the rollout of vaccinations has\nbeen better than in many parts of the country, with all six New England states among the states\nwith the highest percentage of residents who have received at least one shot.\nIn contrast, as the figure shows, Europe has had difficulty obtaining a sufficient vaccine\nsupply, and then getting that supply to people, at a time when variants of the virus are\nunfortunately proving more contagious. This has caused several European countries to once\nagain confront rising infection rates with increased restrictions on social mobility. Without these\npolicies hospitals would again become strained and deaths would rise. The problem is even\nworse in many third-world countries, where there is little to no domestic vaccine production, and\nvaccine costs are prohibitively high.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 2 shows that as the vaccination rollout in the U.S. has improved since the\nbeginning of the year, FOMC participants have upgraded their outlook for GDP, as reported in\nthe Summary of Economic Projections, which is a collection of economic projections made by\nFed policymakers four times a year. Passage of the large fiscal stimulus also played a role.\nSpecifically, between the December projections and the March projections, the median GDP\ngrowth forecast for this year has risen by more than 2 percentage points.\nThis optimism appears to also be shared by private-sector forecasters. Figure 3 reports\nthe four most recent GDP forecasts from the Blue Chip Survey (which polls roughly 50 privatesector economic forecasters). Many of the Blue Chip forecasters have upgraded their forecast of\nhow quickly the economy will recover. Passage of fiscal stimulus also played a role. Between\nJanuary and April, these private forecasters have increased their forecast for economic growth,\nparticularly in the first half of the year.\nFigure 4 provides a sense of the distribution of the Blue Chip forecasts. The average of\nthe 10 forecasters with the highest growth rate are expecting GDP growth in excess of 10\npercent. The average of the 10 forecasters with the lowest growth rate still exceeds 3 percent\nthrough this year.\nThe rapid projected growth in GDP is similarly reflected in expectations for significant\nimprovements in the labor market. Figure 5 shows the unemployment rate forecast from the\nFOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. From September to March, FOMC participants\nhave been lowering their estimate of the path of unemployment as they raised their estimated\npath of GDP growth. Over that six-month period, with substantially more fiscal spending than\nestimated last September and better vaccination outcomes than expected at the end of 2020,\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nparticipants have reduced their forecast of unemployment for the end of this year by 1 percentage\npoint, with declines in forecasts for subsequent years also substantial. Figure 6 shows that the\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast follows a similar pattern – but starting from a slightly\nhigher level, ends at a slightly higher level than the SEP, despite a slightly less gradual decline in\n2022.\nFOMC participants have also been increasing their estimates for core PCE inflation,\nshown in Figure 7. The most recent forecast, shown as squares, has core inflation somewhat\nexceeding 2 percent in 2021 and 2023. The average core inflation rate for the Blue Chip\nforecasters is roughly in line with the Summary of Economic Projections from FOMC\nparticipants. However, as Figure 8 shows, the range of Blue Chip survey forecasts is quite large\nbetween the average of the 10 highest inflation forecasts and the average of the 10 lowest\ninflation forecasts.\nAs the economy returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation, the median FOMC\nparticipant expectation is that short-term interest rates will remain close to zero through 2023, as\nis shown in Figure 9. Note that during most previous economic recoveries, forecasts of\nreturning to full employment at the target inflation rate would have been accompanied by\nexpectations of gradual increases in interest rates. However, with the revised monetary policy\nframework adopted by the FOMC, monetary policymakers can be more patient and wait for\nmore tangible signs that inflation has increased, rather than just forecasts, before starting to raise\nrates.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Employment Report\nTurning to the labor markets, the most recent data on employment are quite consistent\nwith an economy beginning to expand from the constraints of the pandemic. Figure 10 shows\nthat after a pandemic-related slowdown at the end of last year, payroll employment has been\nincreasing. In March alone, more than 900,000 new jobs were created.\nFigure 11 shows that some of the growth in jobs has been in industries that had been\nstrongly impacted, initially, by the pandemic and the need for social distancing. Leisure and\nhospitality employment, which declined during the second wave of the pandemic at the end of\nlast year and the beginning of this year, has since been rising – though employment still remains\nwell below levels seen prior to the pandemic. If one looks at total employment not including\nleisure and hospitality, jobs have been increasing gradually, but still remain somewhat below\ntheir pre-pandemic levels.\nOther indications of the continued strains on the labor market as a result of the pandemic\nare the changes in the labor force participation rates for prime working age men and women,\nshown in Figure 12. With many schools either in a remote or hybrid learning mode, many\nparents have left the workforce to provide support for their children. Those who leave the labor\nforce are not counted as unemployed, even though some of them would nevertheless prefer to be\nworking if the childcare situation were different and job conditions were better. In this respect,\nreduced labor force participation represents a concerning development. While labor force\nparticipation has been improving of late, it is still well below the participation rate we saw before\nthe pandemic.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGiven the challenges in the labor market, fiscal and monetary policy are unusually\nstimulative, with the hope that the economic recovery will be much faster than the one following\nthe Great Recession. As Figure 13 shows, five years after the 2008 recession, the\nunemployment rate was still close to 8 percent. Of course the nature of the 2020 shock was very\ndifferent, as was the condition of banks this time, but with a much more aggressive monetary and\nfiscal policy response and the rapid development of vaccines, the unemployment rate has already\nfallen much more quickly this time. And as I previously showed, FOMC participants expect that\nthe unemployment rate will decline to just under 4 percent within two years.\n\nSome Risks to the Economic Outlook\nWhile there are downside risks to economic activity from potential COVID-19 virus\nvariants, risks to the upside are also present, as the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus is\nmuch greater now than in previous cycles. These upside risks could, in turn, pose some financial\nstability risks when the next recession occurs. As I mentioned earlier, my view is that other\nremaining risks are the structural ones that contributed to the financial market disruptions that\noccurred when the pandemic began last year.3\nThe first of the three structural risks I see relates to short-term credit markets, which, in\nthe past two recessions, have been disrupted by runs on prime and tax-exempt money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). Figure 14 shows the run on prime funds as a sharp reduction in assets\nunder management, in 2008 and in 2020. These funds invest in relatively high-quality, shortterm credit instruments, which can experience liquidity problems if investors pull their money\nfrom the money funds quickly, forcing the funds to sell relatively illiquid assets into distressed\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmarkets. Figure 15 depicts that problem, showing that in both 2008 and 2020, such selling into\ndistressed markets caused a spike in the spread above the Fed Funds rate for highly rated, assetbacked commercial debt. Other indicators of funding market stress also spiked during both\nepisodes, including those for short-term municipal debt.\nSimply put, prime and tax-exempt MMMFs should not need emergency lending facilities\nas they did in the financial crisis that began in 2007, and more recently at the onset of the\npandemic. Unlike prime and tax-exempt funds, government MMMFs (which invest in shortterm U.S. Treasury and agency securities and private debt fully collateralized by such\ninstruments) did not experience the same problems – rather, government funds experienced large\ninflows. One potential solution would be to require prime and tax-exempt MMMFs to convert to\nsuch government funds.4\nI should mention that the pandemic also shed a light on the remaining structural\nvulnerabilities in open-end mutual funds (MFs), particularly corporate debt MFs, which allow\ndaily redemptions, notwithstanding the liquidity of their underlying assets.5 A potential\nremedial action would be to require all MFs to adopt swing pricing, which is currently\nvoluntary.6 A properly calibrated swing pricing system could reduce investors’ incentives to run,\nas it would force them to at least partially bear the cost of their redemptions, without\ndisadvantaging those investors choosing to remain in the fund. Alternatively, measures that\nmatch a MF’s redemption frequency to the liquidity profile of its underlying holdings are worth\nexploring.\nA second risk that came into view at the onset of the pandemic involved a “dash for\nliquidity,” in which a variety of entities, seeking to bolster their liquidity positions, sold large\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nvolumes of U.S. Treasury securities. However, the infrastructure for buying and selling U.S.\nTreasury securities relies primarily on broker-dealers and could become strained if unusually\nlarge volumes of Treasury securities are being sold, as was the case in March. One possible\nsolution would be to create a structure less reliant on broker-dealers’ balance sheets to maintain\nliquid markets for these securities. One way this could be done is by creating expanded central\nclearing mechanisms for Treasury securities and the financing of Treasury securities.\nA third risk that became apparent early in 2020 was the concern that banks would\nconstrict credit, potentially exacerbating the economic downturn. A variety of regulatory relief\nproposals were adopted, including greater forbearance for borrowers, encouragement to utilize\ncapital buffers, and a relaxation of some of the prevailing capital requirements.7 In addition,\nbanks were asked to stop share repurchases and limit dividend payments until it was clear that\ntheir capital was sufficient to weather the recession brought on by the pandemic. While these\nmeasures were needed at the time, and thus appropriate, in my view they reflect a capital regime\nthat is not sufficiently flexible during economic downturns. Investors in banks, and bank\nmanagement teams, would prefer to avoid the attendant uncertainty around capital planning, and\nbank regulators would prefer to not suspend bank regulations in economic downturns.\nA solution to this problem is to provide a Countercyclical Capital Buffer, or CCyB, that\ngets built up during economic recoveries, but is expected to be drawn down during economic\ndownturns. Rather than disrupt bank capital planning and rely on temporary relief from capital\nregulations, the CCyB provides a “shock absorber” that, if appropriately implemented, would\nallow borrower financing to continue without these temporary extraordinary and less predictable\nmeasures.8\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA policy that runs a “hot” economy could pose other financial stability challenges, as I\nhave discussed in previous speeches. However, my view is that these three structural risks seem\nthe most immediate to address in an effort to avoid a repeat of the financial problems\nexperienced at the outset of the pandemic.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIt seems likely that the economy will grow rapidly this year. This should reduce the slack\nin the labor markets and eventually return inflation to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nAssuming virus variants do not become especially problematic, we should see an unusually\nstrong post-recession recovery.\nWhile the near-term public health and macroeconomic improvements are more than\nwelcome and critically important, I also believe that policymakers across the spectrum should\ntake the time to examine some of the problems brought to the forefront over the past year. In\ndoing so, they can help to ensure we are rebuilding an economy that works for all Americans\nthroughout the inevitable business cycle.\nThe combination of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, and consumers and firms\nwell positioned to renew spending, should result in returning to full employment much more\nquickly than after the last financial crisis and Great Recession. However, many of the\nunderlying problems that can disrupt financial stability – as at the outset of the pandemic – still\nneed to be addressed. During the economic recovery, policymakers should be diligent about\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, April 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nremoving these risks to financial stability, which translate into risks for the economy and every\nfirm and worker in it.\nThank you for having me speak today, and best wishes for good health and economic\nrecovery in the months ahead.\n\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Feb. 19, 2021, talk by Eric S. Rosengren entitled: Perspectives on the Eventual Economic\nRecovery.\n2\n\nFor more discussion of the changes to the framework, see: Federal Reserve Board - 2020 Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\n3\n\nFor more discussion, see Oct. 8, 2020, remarks by Eric S. Rosengren, entitled Economic Fragility: Implications for\nRecovery from the Pandemic, and also Jan. 12, 2021, remarks entitled, The Economic Outlook – Optimism Despite\nthe Challenges Ahead.\n4\n\nSome MMMF sponsors have converted their prime funds into government funds. For example, Vanguard, noting\nthe “…rewards of even the most conservatively managed prime funds are no longer worth the risk,” reorganized its\nprime money market fund into a government fund. See: Vanguard, Aug. 2020, Vanguard Announces Changes to\nMoney Market Fund Lineup.\nPolicymakers have highlighted “liquidity transformation” risks as a vulnerability arising from the MF structure.\nSuch funds offer daily redemptions, irrespective of the liquidity profile of their holdings. The key concern is that\nheavy investor redemptions would force MFs to liquidate assets at “fire sale prices,” which could impact other\nfinancial markets. Last March, corporate and municipal bond MFs experienced significant redemptions, which\nlikely contributed to strains in bond markets during that period.\n5\n\nA fund that adopts swing pricing will reduce (increase) its price per share by a pre-established “factor” if net\nredemptions (purchases) exceed a certain threshold. We are not aware of any U.S. MF that has adopted swing\npricing. In contrast, swing pricing is widely used in Europe, and some research suggests it reduces redemptions\nduring periods of stress.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nYale Economic Development Symposium,\nhosted by the Yale School of Management’s\nEconomic Development Club\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for inviting me to address the Yale Economic\nDevelopment Symposium. The theme of this gathering, rebuilding an inclusive economy, is\nhighly relevant to the current moment, and is central to many policy discussions. I am pleased to\nbe able to offer my own perspectives with you today on this important topic.\nThe most recent policy statement from the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-setting Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) noted how “the ongoing public health crisis continues to\nweigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the\neconomic outlook.” 1 Indeed, the impact of COVID-19 has been extraordinary, damaging\nindividuals, families, businesses, and the economy overall. And the disparate economic\noutcomes for some individuals and groups during the pandemic have further exacerbated longstanding issues in our economy.\nFortunately, vaccine distribution across the United States is underway – and while not as\nseamless a rollout as any of us would have hoped, the vaccines represent a very promising\ndevelopment. Although COVID-19 infection rates have recently declined, they remain at a\nrelatively high level. While it seems likely that the economy will continue to grow despite this\nelevated infection rate, a more rapid pace of economic activity will be realized only when there\nare widespread inoculations. Indeed, a successful vaccination rollout by the middle of the\nsummer suggests that by the second half of this year a robust economic recovery should be\nunderway – supported by the current accommodative stance of both monetary and fiscal policy.\nToday, I will first focus on the outlook for the U.S. economy, including some discussion\nof economic conditions in Connecticut. The uneven nature of this downturn has highlighted the\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nneed to rebuild the economy in a more inclusive way. I will suggest some development policies\nthat I believe will help complement the traditional macro policy responses, to build a more\nequitable economy.\nOver the past several months, economic trends have largely been determined by the path\nof the virus and the resulting health policy responses. I expect, unfortunately, that the evolution\nof the virus will continue to determine the course of the economy through the middle of the year,\nas the U.S. and our trading partners continue to grapple with the continually evolving public\nhealth crisis.\nI will emphasize today that the pandemic has had significantly divergent impacts on\ndifferent industries and workers, leading to very different economic outcomes across different\nsegments of the population. The sectors most impacted by social distancing, due to significant\ncustomer-facing interaction – recreation, entertainment, retail, restaurants, travel, and hotels – are\nalso large employers of workers who receive relatively low wages. Many of the employees\nworking in these sectors are Black or Hispanic. In addition, many are women and many are\nyounger workers. As a result, these segments of the population have suffered disproportionately\nduring the pandemic.\nIn contrast, Americans with jobs that can be performed remotely, although certainly\nconstrained by the pandemic, have been able to continue working – albeit from home. As a\nresult, certain segments of the economy – those where working at a computer or over the phone\nis feasible – allow these businesses to be conducted from socially distanced locations, largely\nuninterrupted. In fact, this evolution in the way we work and collaborate might have long-lasting\neffects on the workplace of the future. There are also some goods-producing industries where\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproduction lines can achieve some social distancing, and these industries have flourished. Many\nof the workers in minimally affected jobs have found themselves saving more money as the\npandemic limits spending on travel, entertainment, and other things.\nGiven this added savings, we should see a significant increase in demand for many of the\nactivities that have been limited by social distancing once consumers no longer feel threatened\nby the virus. Of course, this requires that public health officials can successfully vaccinate a\nlarge share of the population, and that the vaccinations continue to keep up with new variants of\nthe virus.\nDespite a potentially difficult road ahead over the next few months, monetary policy is\nquite accommodative, and fiscal policy has been and likely will continue to be forcefully\ndeployed. From my perspective, both the monetary and fiscal policy responses have been quite\nappropriate, given the severity of the public-health-induced economic crisis. 2\nPerhaps, however, it is not enough to focus solely on the macroeconomic response to the\npandemic. The recovery provides us a unique opportunity to ensure that the economic rebuilding\nprocess advances a more inclusive economy. Indeed, the pandemic has highlighted the critical\nimportance of finding ways to improve workforce development, increase workplace flexibility,\nand revitalize areas where many low-income workers reside.\nA number of programs can continue to make a difference along these dimensions. I will\nfocus today on initiatives that are improving child care, improving the quality of jobs, and\nproviding additional financing targeted to those communities most impacted by the pandemic.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nFigure 1 highlights the scope of the tragic effects of the COVID-19 virus. For the U.S.\nas a whole (the blue line), deaths per million of population late last year surpassed the\ncomparable number reached last spring, during the early stages of the pandemic, and remain\nelevated. In Connecticut (the green line), the death rate per million of population is substantially\nlower than in the spring, but still not much different from the national average. The persistent\nseverity of the pandemic continues to limit individuals’ willingness to venture much beyond their\nown residence, with many people preferring to shelter at home while waiting for the supply of\nvaccines to catch up with demand.\nMobility data – which is measured by cell-phone-based data on foot traffic to over 5\nmillion points of interest – capture how individuals’ movements have been altered by social\ndistancing. As Figure 2 shows, for the U.S. and Connecticut, government mandated restrictions\nlast spring meant that many individuals either chose to curtail their visits to restaurants and to\nestablishments involved in non-essential retail (for instance, discretionary shopping) or were\nforced to, because the establishments were shut down. As the distancing restrictions reduced\ninfection rates, mandates were relaxed, and there was a significant pick-up in visits to restaurants\nand stores.\nHowever, as we approached winter and the second wave of infections swelled, many\nstates that had scaled back restrictions saw infections and deaths rise once again, with people\nreducing their mobility accordingly. Mobility in Connecticut data has largely mirrored the\nnational trends. And the weaker economic data that we have seen for the end of last year are\nconsistent with the reduced mobility.\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nNote that the reaction to the even more severe second wave – in terms of reduced\nmobility – is, in part, more modest than the reaction to the initial wave last spring, as firms and\nconsumers have adapted to the constraints imposed by the virus. High-frequency spending data,\nshown in Figure 3, highlight that spending fell dramatically in the spring and has remained\ndepressed for the spending categories that are most impacted by social distancing. 3 However,\nconsumers have substituted goods that can be delivered to the home for services that require\nleaving the house. The right side of the chart shows data for Connecticut; the series are\nsomewhat different as they are changes in spending per transaction rather than changes in total\nspending. The data show a similar pattern to the U.S., with depressed spending on social\ndistance-sensitive segments relative to all other spending. While social distance-sensitive\nspending started to rebound as cases declined in the late spring and summer, it retreated as cases\nrose again.\nConsistent with the spending data, we have seen sharp fluctuations in employment,\nparticularly in industries most affected by social distancing, shown in Figure 4. There were\ndramatic declines in payroll employment in the spring, some recovery during the summer, and\nfurther declines at the end of last year. Not surprisingly, the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\ncategory shows the biggest decline, with many businesses in this segment of the economy still\nbeing restricted by limits on congregating. Employment in Connecticut in these sectors, shown\non the right side of the figure, has largely mirrored that of the nation.\nFigure 5 shows the change in employment from February 2020 through January of this\nyear, for the U.S. as a whole. Even though employment has generally been expanding since\nMay, given the sharp declines in payroll employment in these industries last March and April,\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwe remain well below the employment levels we saw roughly one year ago. Unfortunately,\nbecause of the composition of the workforce in many of these industries, Black and Hispanic\nworkers have borne a disproportionate share of the pain.\nTo capture the extent of the differences in labor market outcomes across segments of the\npopulation, Figure 6 focuses on a broader measure of labor market slack, the U-6 measure of\nunemployment. As well as including people unemployed and actively looking for work, the U-6\nmeasure also encompasses people who are working part time for economic reasons and persons\nwho are marginally attached to the labor force. By this broader U-6 measure, labor market\noutcomes for Blacks and Hispanics since last February have been significantly worse than for\nWhite workers. Note, however, that race is not the only distinguishing feature of how the\npandemic has impacted the workforce. Figure 7 shows that younger workers have also suffered\ndisproportionately, with the U-6 measure for younger workers roughly double that of older\nworkers. These race and age patterns in unemployment are not uncommon during a recession\nand the early stages of a recovery, but they are nevertheless important to highlight if as a society\nwe want to achieve more equitable outcomes.\nWomen in the workforce have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic as\nwell. While a U-6 measure by gender would not show a dramatically different experience for\nmen and women, other measures highlight the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on\nwomen. Figure 8 shows the labor force participation rate for men and women by age\ncategories. Overall, the labor force participation rate for women has fallen by more than that for\nmen. The differential is more pronounced by age category. For the younger age groups,\nwomen’s labor force participation rates have fallen by over a full percentage point more than\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmen’s labor force participation. The younger age categories are those where families might have\nchild care issues during the pandemic which could cause a parent, likely a woman, to leave the\nlabor force.\nA closer examination of labor market outcomes in the pandemic also reveals differences\nin the type of unemployment. Figure 9 shows that temporary layoffs have been much more\nprevalent than during previous downturns (they are shown in the dark blue area at the base of the\nfigure). 4 Figure 10 shows that the industries that account for much of the significant rise in\ntemporary layoffs have been those most impacted by social distancing – such as leisure and\nhospitality. While temporary layoffs would normally come with the expectation of being\nrehired, perhaps quickly, such an expectation reflects in part that temporary layoffs in the past\noften involved large firms that were likely to recall workers once demand started to recover. 5\nIndeed, Figure 11 shows that roughly 30 percent of temporary layoffs currently involve workers\nwho have been on layoff for 27 or more weeks. Though temporary layoffs have fallen\ndramatically from their peak of over 18 million workers, to just under 3 million workers, there\nare worrying possibilities to consider. To the extent that many of these nominally temporary\nlayoffs are occurring at relatively small firms, whose reopening status is uncertain, the transition\nback to employment for these remaining temporary unemployed workers may be more difficult\nthan in previous recessions – unless the recovery is exceptionally strong or policy relief\nimmediate.\nFortunately, macroeconomic policies have been forceful since the start of the pandemic.\nThe federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate that the Federal Reserve targets, has been\nbetween 0 and 25 basis points since March, and as the January 27 FOMC statement indicated,\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFed policymakers expect this level to persist until the committee’s stated 2 percent inflation\ntarget has been reached. The Federal Reserve is also continuing its purchases of Treasury and\nmortgage-backed (MBS) securities, which makes it easier and less expensive for individuals and\nfirms to borrow at longer horizons. These purchases will continue until there is substantially\nmore progress in lowering unemployment and raising inflation.\nImportantly, fiscal policy is the most effective option when monetary policy has reached\nthe lower effective bound for interest rates. Fiscal policymakers have already taken significant\naction, and further actions are under discussion in Washington. To my eye, policymakers have\nreacted aggressively to the current pandemic-driven economic situation and appear prepared to\ncontinue with additional fiscal and monetary policy actions as needed in order to avoid further\nimpairment of labor markets and the economy as a whole.\n\nCommunity Development Actions\nWhile improving near-term public health and macroeconomic conditions are critically\nimportant, my own view is that policymakers should also take the time, as we rethink so many\nthings coming out of the pandemic, to resolve some of the problems that have been brought to\nthe forefront over the past year. “Essential employees,” for instance, have always been essential,\nbut the prevalence of COVID-19 has made the challenges faced by that segment of the\nworkforce more apparent. Indeed, we have been frequently reminded anew that these workers\nprovide services that all of us need to survive.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne example is illustrated in Figure 12, which looks at income levels and the\ncomposition of service workers in New England prior to the pandemic. The low-wage nature of\nservice jobs is clear as 35 percent of service workers have family income less than 200 percent of\nthe Federal Poverty Level, compared with 20 percent among workers overall. And, a larger\nshare of service workers rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to\nfeed their families despite having a job. And finally, it shows that Hispanics in particular hold a\ndisproportionate share of these jobs. Moreover, many of these jobs did not come with benefits\npackages.\nParticularly striking is the disparity in access to any form of health insurance coverage for\nnon-health care essential workers in New England at the onset of the pandemic, shown in Figure\n13. While 7.7 percent of White essential workers were uninsured, 10.5 percent of Black\nessential workers and 13.6 percent of Hispanic essential workers did not have health insurance.\nIn addition, essential workers who have health insurance often face the challenging prevalence of\nhigh-cost, high-deductible plans. Along with health insurance, there is a need for safe workplace\nenvironments, with employers investing sufficiently to protect their employees. The rethinking\nof the workplace that will come as we move beyond the pandemic should also redouble thinking\non safety, broadly speaking – along with the public health benefits that may accrue from better\naccess to primary care, medical visits, and sick leave.\nWe should all remember that prior to the pandemic, a major concern of employers across\nNew England was filling job openings in very tight labor markets. At the same time, in my visits\nto many New England locales – including, for example, East Hartford, Connecticut – potential\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkers noted the impediments created by inflexible job characteristics that limited their ability\nto participate in the workforce.\nIn the economics field, we often focus on the need for workers to have sufficient skills to\nmatch the needs of employers. Indeed, a worker’s investment in education and in other workrelated skills can have a significant impact on wages and on the likelihood of holding onto a job\nin an economic downturn. But as Figure 14 illustrates, the other side of the equation is\nimportant; employers can and should consider how to tweak or tailor jobs to the workforce they\ncan attract and need to attract. Features that raise “job quality” can be a win not only for\nworkers, but also for employers seeking to attract and retain talent. In particular, finding ways to\nadapt or alter regular hours so that workers can more easily commute and deal with child care or\nelder care could make a big difference toward the goal of raising labor force participation –\nespecially if coupled with more significant benefits that include health insurance, sick and family\nleave, and taking advantage of technology to allow working from home when appropriate.\nOther actions may require more partnerships between employers and government. The\npandemic has left many families struggling with remote schooling and a lack of child care\noptions. Many parents have made difficult family and financial decisions to provide for the\nneeds of their children during the pandemic, with some choosing (at least temporarily) to exit the\nworkforce. I believe we can do more as a nation to make sure these parents can return to the\nworkforce even after the pandemic has subsided. These solutions, however, will require creative\nthinking, and employer and government support for affordable, quality child care – which\ncontinues to be an issue for so many families – and early childhood education. Absent such an\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neffort, many individuals will continue to be held back from participating in the labor market,\nwith negative repercussions for the economy as a whole.\nFinally, one of the challenges during the pandemic has been maintaining momentum to\nadvance important economic development goals in an economic context that has changed\nconsiderably. Prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston had been working with\na number of cities and rural communities around New England to provide collaborative solutions\nto community problems through our Working Places initiative. 6\nHere in Connecticut, for instance, the effort involves a partnership between the Boston\nFed, the state, members of the private sector and philanthropic communities, and five\nConnecticut cities. The program consists of a three-year grant funding competition designed to\nstrengthen civic infrastructure in the participating communities by supporting teams of leaders\ncollaborating across sectors on shared economic goals, an approach supported by Boston Fed\nresearch. 7 The cities of Danbury, East Hartford, Hartford, Middletown, and Waterbury are\nworking on a variety of efforts geared toward systemic change, engaging residents, addressing\nracial equity, and learning and adapting to build a more inclusive and equitable local economy\nfor their residents (Figure 15).\nWhile the work is not yet completed, we have already seen many cities achieving the\nmilestones they set out for themselves. This sort of cross-sector collaboration at the state and\nlocal level is, in my view, critical to our ability to rebuild for a more inclusive economy set up\nfor more widespread prosperity, better business conditions, and more resilient long-term growth.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, February 19, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe past year with the pandemic has been grueling. Eleven months after the initial\noutbreak, economic outcomes for individuals and businesses still remain closely tied to finding\nand implementing effective public health policy. However, with the successful development of\nmultiple vaccines, it is now possible to imagine much better macroeconomic outcomes ahead. 8\nMy view is that policymakers must work to ensure that the benefits of the eventual recovery are\nwidely shared.\nAs I’ve mentioned, I believe that as we think about recovery from the pandemic, we\nshould take the time to look for ways that our economy can be reimagined for the better with\nwhat we have learned during this trying period. We should learn from the challenges that the\npandemic brought to the forefront – but were simmering even before COVID-19. And we\nshould capitalize on the opportunities that stem from realizing new ways of working and extend\nthem more broadly to benefit more workers – especially those in low- and moderate-wage\noccupations – along with employers, industries, and local economies.\nThank you for having me, and I wish you all continued good health in 2021.\n\nSee Jan. 27, 2021 FOMC statement:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210127a.htm.\n\n1\n\nIt is worth noting that this strong fiscal and monetary policy response is needed, in part, because the public health\nresponse was not as forceful as it needed to be.\n\n2\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\n\nJanuary 12, 2021\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon, and a very happy new year to all. It has been a long and unprecedented\nnine months since the COVID-19 pandemic forced Greater Boston to all but shut down last\nMarch. Through December and into early January, the pandemic continues to significantly alter\nour normal ways of living and working. However, we come now to a time of considerable\npromise: as the new year dawns, it seems likely that the public health crisis that has inflicted so\nmuch damage – on individuals, families, businesses, and the economy generally – will dissipate\nover the course of this year. With two highly effective vaccines already starting to be distributed\nin the United States and more in the pipeline – and with medical staff and those most at risk now\nbeing vaccinated – we should see much needed relief for hospitals as we move into the spring.\nAlthough it seems likely to me that the economy will, at best, continue to grow modestly until\nthere is widespread vaccination, I believe a more robust economic recovery – supported by\nexpansionary monetary and fiscal policy – is likely to follow.\nNear-term economic performance is likely to continue to be substantially affected by\npandemic-related challenges. The labor market has stalled as infections have climbed and simple\nself-preservation has forced many people to continue to restrict their activities. Many firms in\nthe service sector remain quite stressed; with restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues likely\nto continue to be materially impacted by the virus, particularly with a new more infectious strain\nreportedly becoming more pervasive.\nIn my view, targeted fiscal policy actions are an appropriate way to support those\nbusinesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic – and the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, recently signed into law, will provide support to many businesses and\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nindividuals that have experienced significant distress. Unfortunately, some states have had to cut\nback on essential services (given their sharp drop in revenue and their balanced-budget rules);\nand the limited financial flexibility of state and local governments is likely to restrain the speed\nof the recovery, similar to what was experienced after the financial crisis of 2007 and ensuing\n“Great Recession.”\nIn addition, it is sobering to note that many of the economic problems caused by the\npandemic have actually been deferred, to date – for example, problems in commercial real estate\nand the bank loans tied to such property are likely to only be fully revealed later this year. These\nfactors, along with the speed of inoculations, will impact how quickly the U.S. economy returns\nto full employment.\nHowever, I am relatively optimistic about the economic outlook for the second half of\n2021. Domestic stock market indices are near all-time highs, suggesting investor confidence in a\nrecovery.1 With very low interest rates, even some financially strapped individuals may be able\nto make payments on debt until incomes are restored (although low interest rates do not solve the\nchallenge of ongoing expenses when there has been an interruption of income).2 The housing\nsector has been helped by low mortgage rates, and the eagerness of many households to transact\nreal estate despite the challenges of the pandemic (and in some cases, because of the pandemic\nand the lifestyle changes it has ushered in). While consumer services remain depressed, the\nconsumer goods sector has recovered nicely and continues to benefit from the broad and\nexpedited movement to online purchasing. Many firms have increased their capital investments,\nas they rely more on technology to conduct business and refit offices to accommodate more\nremote work. For those lucky enough to have the option to work at home, there may be more\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nopportunities to do so going forward, which may be a long-term positive for some, including\nworking parents.\nAs a result, despite the near-term challenges brought on by COVID-19, I am optimistic\nthat we will see significant employment gains over the next two years. However, I do not expect\nthe U.S. economy to reach a sustained 2 percent inflation rate over the same time frame, which\naccording to the guidance the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has\nprovided in its policy statements, implies that policymakers will continue to maintain very\naccommodative short-term rates.\nYet, as I often note, a “low for long” environment does present other important\nchallenges. For example, it encourages firms and individuals to take on more leverage and\nfinancial risk. In addition, many of the financial shocks in March 2020 could have been\nameliorated by proactively addressing problems with money market mutual funds and financial\ninfrastructure before the pandemic hit. If we are to avoid similar problems in the future, my\nview is more needs to be done to make the financial infrastructure of our economy more\nresilient.3\nFinally, and importantly, the disparate economic outcomes we have seen during the\npandemic have further highlighted the problems of income inequality that remain a significant\nchallenge for a strong economy. As I have discussed in recent speeches, policymakers must be\nmindful of the deep pain still occurring in many segments of the economy – particularly for\npersonal-service-related businesses (restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and tourism – for example)\nwhich employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings to cushion against a\ndisruption in wages that lasts for many months. Frequently, these workers are people of color,\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nyoung, or individuals with less educational attainment. Not surprisingly, the unemployment rate\nhas risen the most for these groups.4\n\nThe Near-Term Economic Outlook\nI am looking forward to the time when the outlook for the economy is no longer\nintertwined with that of COVID-19; but unfortunately, that is not yet the case. We continue to\nface an unusually complex employment situation due, in large part, to the uneven response in the\nUnited States to this public health crisis. As I have said in prior talks, I firmly believe that the\npath to stabilizing the economy hinges on first getting the virus under control, and without\neffective public health policy, the virus will remain the major source of economic challenges.5\nFigure 1 shows the rate of COVID infection, scaled by population – for the United\nStates, the European Union, and G-7 countries excluding the U.S. Unfortunately, the figure\nshows that the public health response in this country has been problematic. The U.S. has tended\nto have higher per capita COVID infection rates for much of the past nine months and, relative to\nmany European countries that have managed to gain some control over infection rates through\nlimits on social mobility, the United States now has significantly more infections. This is all the\nmore tragic because these infections are occurring only months before vaccinations will\nsignificantly reduce individuals’ chances of becoming infected.\nWhile infection rates have been high in the U.S., Figure 2 shows that although death\nrates from COVID are quite high, they are roughly similar with that of Europe. For Europe, the\nUnited States, and the G-7 countries excluding the U.S., the death rates among those with\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCOVID are now higher than at any time during the pandemic. The fact that Europe has more\nsubstantially restricted economic activity in response to virus resurgence – and still is seeing very\nhigh death rates – suggests the potential for high economic costs to preventing COVID spread in\nthe near term.\nGiven the high infection and death rates currently seen in the U.S., it is not surprising that\nwe are also observing a softening of economic conditions, in the data. Figure 3 provides the\nfour-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment. Over the last three months, as\nthe pandemic has worsened, the earlier progress reducing the flow of workers into\nunemployment has suffered a setback, with these initial claims for unemployment insurance\nrising somewhat from the end of November and remaining at a very elevated level of 800,000\nclaims. This is consistent with the employment report covering the month of December, released\nlast week, which had unemployment leveling off at 6.7 percent and payroll employment\ndeclining by 140,000.\nHowever, the unemployment rate can be misleading when many people are dropping out\nof the labor force, because it takes into account only those currently seeking work. With many\npeople dropping out of the labor force, data on actual employment can provide a more accurate\nsnapshot of labor market conditions. Figure 4 shows the employment-to-population ratio for the\npast year. When the pandemic first hit, many people were placed on temporary layoff, or\nfurloughed. However, the employment-to-population ratio still shows a large gap relative to prepandemic conditions, reflecting continued elevated numbers of people out of work and also out\nof the labor force.6\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 5 shows the variety of outcomes for payroll employment across industries during\nthe pandemic. Overall, payroll employment is more than 6 percent below the level seen a year\nearlier. Industries such as entertainment, which relies on group gatherings, and personal\nservices, like restaurants, have declined much more than the average for all nonfarm industries.\nThe number of industries that have higher employment than a year ago is limited, but it involves\nwork such as couriers and messengers, and warehousing and storage, as well as building material\nand general merchandise stores – which saw a rise in employment as people worked from, and\nstayed at, home.\nAs shown in Figure 6, some goods that can be consumed at home saw significant\nincreases; including, for example, games and computers. It is important to note that many of\nthese goods are not domestically produced, limiting the employment benefits in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, goods that have been consumed less during the pandemic, when people were largely\nconfined to their homes, include gasoline and cars.\nConsumer services have been more depressed than goods. Figure 7 shows some\nincreases in certain services, such as streaming services and medical laboratories, but there were\nbig declines in many service areas related to travel and entertainment. Many of these depressed\nconsumer services are unlikely to fully recover until widespread vaccination of the population\nhas been achieved.\nOverall, recent indicators suggest near-term problems stemming from elevated infections\nand persistent public health concerns. So clearly, the near-term recovery is highly dependent on\nrapid, widespread vaccination. Unfortunately, to date, the inoculation rate has been\ndisappointing, which likely will impact public health and the economy in the near term.\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA Positive Medium-term Outlook\nAmidst the near-term challenges we face, I will also point out several reasons for\noptimism concerning the economy’s medium-term outlook.\nOne reason to be optimistic is that household saving remains elevated and\naccommodative fiscal policy is likely to further support individuals and firms. Figure 8 shows\nthat the personal saving rate remains quite high, even before the recently enacted additional\nfederal stimulus. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the saving rate was roughly 7.5 percent, and\nmore recently it has been over 12 percent. This suggests that for those whose incomes were not\ninterrupted (for example, those whose jobs were conducive to working from home, and whose\nindustries were not stalled by the pandemic), there is significant capacity to make expenditures\nonce the pandemic is over. Because consumption is such a large part of the economy, in the\nsecond half of the year if vaccinations are widespread, we are likely to see a significant pick up\nin consumption – particularly in the kind of services that consumers have missed during the\npandemic, such as dining in restaurants, traveling, and attending in-person entertainment events.\nA second reason to be optimistic in the medium term is that financial conditions remain\nfavorable, and asset prices have risen significantly since last spring. Figure 9 shows that, despite\nthe substantial decline in stock prices last March as the pandemic took hold, the S&P 500 ended\nthe year roughly 15 percent higher than it was at the beginning of 2020. My view is that highly\naccommodative fiscal and monetary policy will provide a significant tailwind for risky assets this\nyear.\nA third reason to be optimistic is that the housing market has remained quite resilient (in\ncontrast to the last crisis and recession). New and existing single-family home sales plummeted\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nduring the initial COVID lockdown, but recovered over the summer and were more than 20\npercent higher at the end of November than a year prior (Figure 10). While the resurgence in\nthe pandemic has caused a pause in sales, I expect that low interest rates, higher asset prices, and\nmore savings will support continued home purchases in the coming year.\nFigure 11 shows the forecast from the Federal Reserve policymakers’ Summary of\nEconomic Projections, which asks each participant to provide their outlook for the\nunemployment rate over the next three years. My own forecast is somewhat more pessimistic\nthan the consensus in the near term, as a result of the second wave of the pandemic – but does\nanticipate a decline in the unemployment rate once a significant proportion of the population has\nbeen vaccinated.\nIt is important to note that despite my optimism for 2021, there are risks to this outlook.\nThe pandemic is likely to economically scar many individuals and firms. A large number of\nhouseholds have experienced a loss of wealth and employment during the pandemic, and many\nfirms experienced a substantial drop in revenues when they had to shut down. Many businesses\nclosed permanently.\nIn addition, some economic consequences of the pandemic are likely to be revealed only\nwith a lag. A good example is commercial real estate. Figure 12 shows the delinquency of\nloans in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS holdings of commercial real estate).\nSeveral sectors, particularly hotels and retail, are showing delinquencies much higher than even\nduring the severe financial crisis that began in 2007. Most CMBS structures limit the ability to\nwork directly with troubled borrowers, so the problems tend to appear relatively quickly. Similar\nassets held in bank and insurance portfolios have benefited from financial institutions working\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwith many of their borrowers. However, as that forbearance ends, rising nonperforming loans\nare likely to appear by the second half of 2021. This example illustrates that despite the\ngenerally positive outlook for 2021, there are still lingering problems from the pandemic that\nwill likely need to be addressed.\n\nCentral Bank Emergency Support\nA major factor in the resilience of the economy through the pandemic has been the\npresence of significant fiscal and monetary support. Fiscal stimulus from elected officials has\nprovided needed support to businesses and individuals badly impacted by the pandemic.\nMonetary policy has been very supportive as well, as interest rates were immediately reduced to\ntheir lower limit once the pandemic began, in order to enable individuals and businesses to\nborrow very cheaply.7\nOther significant supports came in the variety of emergency lending facilities established\nby the Federal Reserve with the approval of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The New\nYork Reserve Bank operated a number of facilities focused on market functioning, and the\nBoston Reserve Bank operated a facility supporting money market mutual funds. Together,\nthese facilities were important reasons why the financial instability and sharply declining output\nin the spring did not persist through the year.\nIn addition, the Boston Fed administered, on behalf of the Federal Reserve System, a new\ntype of facility during the crisis – the Main Street Lending Program. The program was designed\nto help small- and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations bridge the pandemic\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndownturn.8 The program aimed to assist organizations that might otherwise be in a challenging\nspot – not large enough to have marketable debt that might benefit from the emergency facilities\nfocused on market functioning, but larger than many of the companies utilizing the federal\ngovernment’s Paycheck Protection Program.9\nThe Main Street program is now closed. I am pleased to be able to share some initial\nsummary information on the program with you. This information complements the disclosures\nthe Fed makes on a weekly basis in the H.4.1 statistical release, which includes the net portfolio\nholdings,10 and at 30-day increments per the CARES Act (providing details on Main Street\nProgram loans, last published yesterday, January 11).\nOver 2020, the program extended more than $16.5 billion in lending to over 1,800\ncompanies. As Figures 13 and 14 show, the value and number of loans processed increased\nsignificantly in December. This surge in demand for the program followed the November 19\nannouncement of the decision by the Treasury to not extend CARES Act facilities. It also no\ndoubt reflects the stresses many medium-sized businesses were experiencing at the end of 2020\nas a result of the resurgence of COVID infections.\nI’ll share some summary information and then draw a few conclusions from the data.\n•\n\nWhile Figure 14 shows consistent loan growth from July, it really underlines the\nsurge in demand in December. The program settled just under 650 loans in the\nmonths from July to November, then over 1,150 loans in December alone. Lender\nparticipation also surged in December, with 45 percent of the eventual total pool of\nlenders participating for the first time .\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nAgain, this was quite a surge in demand for Main Street borrowing. On a related side\nnote, I would like to commend everyone at the Fed for their dedication to public\nservice, exhibited by working tirelessly through the month of December to support\nthe increased yearend demand, in an intense effort to meet the needs of program\nparticipants before closure.\n\n•\n\nThe program’s geographic reach was ultimately broad, with settled loans across 49\nstates and two U.S. territories (See Figure 15).\n\n•\n\nLooking at the industries utilizing the program’s loans suggests some unsurprising\nareas of need, given the pandemic’s toll on certain industries where social distancing\nis challenging (See Figure 16). Industrial categories that include food services;\nscientific and technical services; and arts, entertainment, and recreation are the most\nprominent in the Main Street portfolio. Many of these industries reflect what one\nwould expect to be industries disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n\nThe Main Street program proved to be a challenging undertaking for all involved, and\nunfortunately did not meet the needs of everyone who expressed interest; however, my personal\npreference would have been to continue the program through the first half of 2021. The program\nfilled a hole often left unaddressed – support for medium-sized businesses. In my view, there are\nsignificant implications for productivity and industrial organization if only small and large\ncompanies can receive fiscal and lending support during crises.\nAt the same time, while the Main Street lending program provided very helpful\nfinancing, I believe that were certain tweaks permitted, it could have been more impactful. I will\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\noffer a few preliminary observations. First, with less focus on mitigation of potential loss to the\nTreasury, much more credit would have been made available. Second, designing the program to\nhave less legal and operational complexity, and structuring the banks’ role11 differently – for\nexample, as an opportunity to earn fees as long as the loan performed, rather than a 5 percent\nparticipation – may have increased the attractiveness of the program for banks. Finally, longer\nterms and greater ability to refinance would have provided support to medium-sized businesses\nmore akin to what was available to larger companies.\nThe Main Street program was unprecedented, and very challenging, given the fact that\nbusiness loans are not homogeneous and loan participations are difficult to streamline. Still, we\nmust keep in mind the vital importance of credit access, especially to small and medium-sized\ncompanies and nonprofit organizations. If a future crisis compels lawmakers and policymakers\nto want to extend emergency lending to small and medium-sized businesses, through the Fed or\nanother entity, I hope such a program can incorporate the lessons of the Main Street effort and\naddress challenges where possible, so that it is better structured to meet even more firms’ needs.\nDespite the potential for improvements, and its many challenges, the Main Street Lending\nProgram showed the feasibility of marshalling lenders and the public sector to assist hard-toreach businesses – businesses that can survive with the support of a bridge to better times, postdownturn.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, we enter 2021 with some optimism. The pandemic is likely\nto continue to be a problem for public health and the economy until widespread vaccinations take\nhold. Nonetheless, with substantial fiscal and monetary support, I expect a robust recovery\nstarting in the second half of this year. I also expect that short-term interest rates near zero will\nbe appropriate throughout this year, and that the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase longterm assets until the economy is on a stronger economic footing.\nDespite this generally upbeat outlook, my own view is that policymakers must continue\nto find ways to support those individuals and firms that have been disproportionately and\nseverely impacted by the pandemic.\nThank you for having me speak today, and I wish you continued good health in the new\nyear.\n\n1\n\nAnd, potentially, accumulating wealth to complement pent-up demand.\n\n2\n\nIt is worth noting, many low-income individuals lack savings they can rely on, even in good economic times. For\nexample, in 2013, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors introduced an annual survey of the economic well-being\nof U.S. households, which, among other findings, highlighted the so-called ‘$400 problem’ – almost half of\nrespondents at the time could not cover a $400 emergency expense without selling something or borrowing money.\n(For more, see, Attacking the $400 problem on many fronts, Jay Lindsay, Jan. 30, 2019, www.bostonfed.org.)\nAccording to the Board’s most recent survey data, however, Current Report - Update on the Economic Well-Being\nof U.S. Households: July 2020 Results, 70 percent of adult respondents would pay a $400 emergency expense using\ncash or its equivalent, up from 64 percent in April and 63 percent in October 2019.\n3\n\nFor more discussion, see Oct. 8, 2020 remarks by Eric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nUBS European Virtual Conference 2020*\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n*Identical remarks will be presented later in the day as part of the Annual Robert\nGlauber Lecture hosted by the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business & Government at\nHarvard University’s Kennedy School of Government\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning – or good afternoon, depending on where you are tuning in today – and\nthank you for inviting me to join you for the UBS European Virtual Conference. I am happy to\nbe speaking during a most interesting, and, unfortunately, challenging, time for the world\neconomy.\nBoth the United States and many European countries are currently at a place we had\nhoped we could avoid – in the midst of a second wave of a deadly pandemic. In Europe, many\ncountries have gone from modest restrictions to a “shutdown-light” model, to try to bend the\ncurve of COVID-19 cases, with the possibility that more severe shutdowns may be needed. In\nthe U.S., the rise in infections is more recent, and the lack of central coordination has led to\ndivergent responses among states. Some states have done little, if anything, to restrict activity,\nwhile other states have taken a much more proactive public health stance.\nOf course, official policies and personal behavior can differ. For example, some\nlocalities chose to institute requirements for masks, but found enforcement too difficult. Other\nplaces opted for a less conservative public health response, yet people chose to limit their activity\nand focus on self-preservation, staying at home even without being subject to government\nmandates.\nLike many observers, I firmly believe that the path to righting the economy hinges on\nfirst getting the virus under control. Without effective public health policy, the virus will remain\nthe major source of economic problems – despite fiscal and monetary authorities acting early on\nto try to moderate the economic impact of the virus.\nCOVID-19 is what economists would call a “tail event,” meaning something in the\nlower-probability “tails” of a distribution of possible outcomes. (Of course, some had predicted\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthat viral pandemics would occur at some point, so it may be wrong to see it as an especially\nsurprising tail event, or one especially unlikely to occur again). The severity of a tail event can\nbe impacted – positively or negatively – by many factors, not just the immediate fiscal and\nmonetary responses. How well a country is positioned to weather a tail event depends,\nimportantly, on the financial positioning of households, financial institutions, and firms when\nthat tail event strikes. So, while a worldwide pandemic happening precisely when it did could\nnot have been predicted, it was certainly possible that some tail event might occur that would\ndisrupt the economy.\nMy view is that the possibility of such tail events justifies, as prudent, financial\npositioning to lessen the severity of adverse economic shocks – whether those positioning steps\nare personal decisions, such as precautionary savings, or regulatory ones, such as bank capital\ncushions. Those economies that go into a recession in more fragile financial condition are likely\nto experience amplified economic problems that could have been ameliorated with more\nproactive financial stability steps, taken in advance. Of course, protection from adverse tail\nevents is not free, so to speak. The behavior of economic agents is largely based on cost-benefit\ndecisions, often driven by incentives and disincentives provided by policymakers.1\nThe most recent statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC – the\nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy-making body – indicates the committee’s intention to keep\ninterest rates at the current low level until the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target has been achieved. 2\nThis reflects concerns about the below-target inflation rate experienced over the previous decade.\nA potential cost of this policy, from my perspective, would be the incentives that low interest\nrates create for households and firms to take on more leverage and more risk. In the United\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nStates, the corporate sector was more leveraged in early 2020, at least by some measures, than at\nthe beginning of previous recessions. Today, I will discuss the ramifications of low interest rate\npolicies, the impact on leverage, and the potential consequences for a subsequent economic\ndownturn – based on the U.S. experience in the current recession.\nThis is an important time to focus on preventing the buildup of financial imbalances,\nbecause many central banks are considering modifying their reaction functions to prioritize\nachieving certain elements of their mandates. In the United States, that implies being more\nreluctant than in previous recoveries to raise interest rates until we have achieved full\nemployment and 2 percent inflation.3\nWhile I support achieving these two goals, I believe it requires, in addition, a more\nproactive supervisory and financial stability focus to prevent financial imbalances from\nratcheting up the severity of economic downturns. In the United States, this is particularly\nproblematic, because legislation formulated after the financial crisis has not mandated a financial\nstability focus, but rather a too-big-to-fail focus, and the regulatory tools available to the Fed are\nmuch more limited than in many European and Asian countries.\nI will also highlight in my remarks today that those segments of the labor market most\naffected by amplified business cycles – when financial stability “guardrails” are limited – can be\npopulated by those workers who are most vulnerable and least able to adapt to the changed\neconomic environment. That imbalanced human toll is a bad outcome for democracy as well as\nthe economy.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Current Situation\nA healthy economy requires a healthy populace. In both Europe and the United States, a\nfull recovery is not possible until the public health crisis has been addressed. Figure 1 shows the\ndramatic differences across countries in their experience with the virus. On the horizontal axis is\na country’s share of the global population, and on the vertical axis is a country’s share of world\ndeaths from COVID-19. Countries above the dotted line are, given their population,\noverrepresented in deaths caused by the virus, and those below the dotted line are\nunderrepresented in virus deaths, given their population.4\nWorth noting is that two panels are needed in the figure. On the left chart, the U.S. is so\ndisproportionately accounting for world COVID-19 deaths that it required a separate scale from\nthe right chart. Unfortunately, several European countries also have a disproportionately high\nnumber of deaths, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy – and have recently\nimposed new restrictions.\nOn the other hand, Figure 1 shows there are countries that have done well in managing\nthe virus, including New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea. Even a developing country,\nVietnam, is showing a disproportionately low share of COVID deaths given its share of the\nworld population, implying its success in controlling the virus.\nObviously, the virus has had severe economic consequences, as shown in Figure 2. It is\nuseful to think about the virus’s effects in economies that disproportionately involve services,\nwhich tend to require more personal interaction than the production and sale of goods. And, in\nfact, service activities proved to be more affected by the need to social distance than were goodsproducing activities. In the United States, consumption of goods now exceeds what was\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconsumed at the beginning of the year, while services consumption remains depressed.\nAmericans have continued remodeling houses and buying durable goods, but things like\ntraveling and recreational activities outside of the home are taking place at a lower rate. Thus,\nthe virus is a disproportionate shock for those countries that are more services dependent, such as\nthe U.S., and most developed countries.\n\nImpact of Economic Shocks\nWhile the economic impact of COVID-19 may fall disproportionately on service-oriented\neconomies where the services require a lot of social interaction, other factors also are important\nin determining the severity of the pandemic’s economic consequences. As Figure 3 shows, the\nUnited States economy goes through cycles, with ups and downs of the unemployment rate\nreflecting episodes of recessions and expansions.\nThe figure highlights two important points. First, the amplitude of the unemployment\nrate is currently quite high, as it was during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The second point\nworth noting is that the area on the chart where unemployment is above the so-called full\nemployment level has been much larger than the area involving unemployment below the\nestimate of full employment.5 Part of the reason for this asymmetry is that much of the history\nof this sample reflected a disinflationary trend – inflation fell consistently from 1980 to 2004.\nSeveral of the instances where the unemployment rate bounced back up sharply were recessions,\nresulting from attempts to control inflation. But policymakers also cannot control the dynamics\nof the economy all that precisely. Thus, imbalances in one direction, say exceeding full\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemployment to the point of excessively tight labor markets, tend to result in a bounce back in\nunemployment above the natural rate.\nIf policymakers want to achieve maximum sustainable employment, in my view the focus\nshould be less on pushing the economy well below full employment – which helps produce\nimbalances in the economy that could also affect the severity of the next recession.\nSome imbalances are worse than others. Note that in the recovery from the Financial\nCrisis and Great Recession, the U.S. saw just over nine years with the unemployment rate above\nthe full employment level, but just over three years of an unemployment rate below its natural\nrate. Instead of pushing the unemployment rate below its natural rate, the focus should be on\navoiding the subsequent large spikes of unemployment and slow recovery that occur when the\ndownturn is made worse by a lead-up that involves excessive risk-taking and the associated\nimbalances, both real and financial.6\nAn additional important factor in the severity of a downturn is the policy response.\nFortunately, in the United States the initial policy response to COVID-19 by monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers was prompt and substantial.7 Unlike the beginnings of some recessions when it is\ninitially unclear whether the economy is in a downturn at the outset, the rapid increase in the\nCOVID-19 virus, the economic shutdowns, and the sharp decline in asset prices made it\nimmediately clear to policymakers that swift action was needed.\nFiscal policymakers moved quite quickly by historical standards in the U.S., with support\nfocused on small businesses and low- and moderate-income workers. Monetary policy was also\nimplemented promptly. In March, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to between\n0 and 25 basis points (Figure 4) and began asset purchases (Figure 5). And a series of\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemergency lending facilities were announced that were designed to stabilize financial markets\nand provide support for businesses. This swift action by policymakers has been critical to the\nimprovements in the economy so far. Now, with a second wave of infections underway, my\nsense is that more fiscal and monetary accommodation is appropriate.\n\nFinancial Fragility\nAnother factor shaping the severity of this recession – in other words, the severity of the\nconsequences of the pandemic shock – is how fragile, or susceptible to financial instability, the\neconomy was prior to the shock. How well prepared were firms, households, and financial\ninstitutions for a so-called tail event? In the interest of time, today I will look specifically at the\npreparedness of firms.\nAn examination of payroll employment by industry shows firms whose business requires\nsocial interaction continue to be badly disrupted by the pandemic. Figure 6 shows that retail,\narts and entertainment, restaurants, and hotels have all been severely impacted. While payroll\nemployment declined in these industries during the past recession, payroll employment declined\nmuch more substantially with the pandemic and remains well below levels from the previous\nyear.\nThe large and enduring weakness in these sectors has other costs besides the loss of jobs\nin the short run. Figure 7 shows a list of publicly traded firms in the consumer discretionary\nspace that have defaulted on debt (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020.8 Two observations stand\nout. First, most of these firms had elevated leverage, as evidenced by their most recently\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreported, pre-pandemic, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n(EBITDA) ratios being quite elevated. In fact, most of the firms had debt to EBITDA too high to\nqualify for support through the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, a lending\nfacility designed to aid troubled firms impacted by COVID-19, which requires a debt-toEBITDA ratio under six for collateralized loans.9 The second observation is that these firms are\n“labor intensive.” The consumer discretionary sector accounts for significant employment, much\nof it relatively low-wage workers. And, of course, bankruptcies tend to make temporarily\nunemployed workers into longer-term unemployed workers.\nIt is important to note when the high level of debt was incurred. If it was incurred right\nbefore the shock, the appropriate financial stability approach may be different than if it was\nincurred much earlier in the recovery. Put another way, how has leverage in the corporate sector\nevolved over the years amid the low interest rate environment, and what are the potential\nramifications of this trend? This is an important question, which I will discuss next with some\npreliminary observations.\nFigure 8 shows the median debt-to-EBITDA ratio for (mostly publicly traded) firms in\nthe consumer discretionary sector that defaulted (and/or filed for bankruptcy) in 2020 and those\nthat did not. Interestingly, through 2013 the median debt to EBITDA was around or below two\ntimes for the defaulted and the non-defaulted firms. However, during the recovery period the\nmedian debt leverage of defaulted firms rose quite sharply, reaching more than eight times right\nbefore the recession – while the non-defaulted firms had only a mild increased reliance on debt.\nThe debt-to-EBITDA measure can be affected by firms with very low profitability.\nFigure 9 shows the capacity to service debt had become impaired at defaulted firms, and Figure\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n10 shows that the debt-to-assets ratio, another measure of leverage, began rising sharply in 2011.\nAs a result, when the recovery had started, but interest rates were low, the firms that eventually\ndefaulted issued much more debt, and this increased leverage appears to have affected their\nability to survive the pandemic downturn.10\n\nThe Impact of Excessive Risk-Taking\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the financial pressures associated with excessive risktaking behavior build gradually, and usually only become clear in the next economic downturn.\nWhen the ensuing recession occurs – often suddenly – and more severe recessionary dynamics\ntake over, sadly the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that are least able to adjust\nand adapt.11\nIndeed, for the aforementioned defaulted firms, again, focused on the consumer\ndiscretionary sector, the debt began to rise about eight years before the shock. If the results\nharmed only shareholders, one could argue that they should be free to take that risk. However,\nthe fact is that customers, suppliers, and employees are also hurt by risk-taking behavior. Today,\nI will focus on the impact on employees.\nFigure 11 shows the demographics of firms in the service sector. A ratio above one\nindicates that the demographic group is overrepresented in that industry relative to its share in\nthe workforce. Looking at the first row, women are overrepresented in the service sector,\nrelative to their share in the work force. Women are overrepresented in retail as well as in\nleisure and hospitality. Note that Black or African American workers, Hispanic or Latino\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkers, and those workers between the ages 16-24 years are over-represented in leisure and\nhospitality as well.\nIn a bankruptcy situation, there normally is a reduction in workforce, and if it becomes a\nfirm closure, the employee’s connection to the employer is severed. As a result, a significant\nnumber of workers in defaulted firms are likely to lose their jobs, and when many firms in the\nindustry are simultaneously filing for bankruptcy, their ability to find work in the same industry\nwill be difficult.\nDuring the pandemic, women and minorities may not only be disproportionately\nimpacted by excessive risk-taking by these firms, but they are more likely to leave the workforce\naltogether. Figure 12 shows that the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women\nhad fallen sharply again in recent months and is well below the level at the beginning of the year.\nOctober saw a slight uptick in participation rates for both working-age men and women. Figure\n13 shows that minorities also have seen a large decline in labor force participation, relative to the\nbeginning of the year and relative to white workers.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would reiterate that shocks happen, but certain factors\nmake them worse. While the monetary and fiscal policy response in the United States has been\nan important economic mitigant to problems generated by the pandemic since the onset this\nspring, excessive risk-taking during the previous recovery period is, unfortunately, likely to\nprolong the country’s economic distress – especially for those most disproportionately affected.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (3:10 P.M. GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFinancial factors, including excessive leverage, can influence how severe the\nconsequences of a shock will be, and how painful a recession becomes. Imbalances in the real\neconomy and financial factors accelerating recession dynamics can make the effects of a shock\nand the severity of a recession much worse. Today, I have focused on the excessive risk-taking\nof some firms in the consumer discretionary sector. However, imbalances in the household and\nfinancial sector have often been problematic, as well – particularly in the Financial Crisis and\nGreat Recession.\nThese observations have policy implications. In Europe and Asia, many countries have a\ngovernance structure able to focus on the financial stability imbalances that are occurring in their\neconomies, and those countries have tools to try to prevent the buildup of excessive risk. No\nsuch structure or tools are available in the U.S. This is a problem, both now and for future\neconomic downturns.\nWith many central banks focused on keeping interest rates low for an extended period to\nachieve their mandates – for example in the last recovery – it is particularly important to watch\nfor reaching-for-yield behavior and excessive risk-taking. Easy monetary policy requires more\nguardrails protecting against rising financial stability risks. Without financial stability\ngovernance and tools, recessions have the potential to be more severe and fall disproportionately\non those that can least afford it. And the recessions are likely to be deeper and longer, requiring\nmore fiscal and monetary stimulus than would otherwise be necessary.\nIn sum: We need to place more attention on the severity of outcomes in recessions, which\nare made worse if we cannot or will not take action against emerging imbalances.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M.

GMT) on Tuesday, November 10, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you, and I wish you all continued health – and I look\nforward to a time when we can gather in person.\n\n1\n\nFor example, some policies might hinder some of the precautionary decisions made by individuals and regulators.\n\n2\n\nSee Sept. 16, 2020 statement of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm\nReflecting the Fed’s mandates to achieve full employment and price stability, for which we target 2 percent\ninflation.\n3\n\n4\n\nWhile this figure suggests those above the dotted line are overrepresented, it does not shed light on causality.\n\n5\n\nThat is, the level of unemployment estimated to represent the economy at full employment.\n\nOf course, the nature of the shock is also important – whether it is a demand shock or supply shock; a financial\nshock or real shock; a local (U.S. centric) shock or global shock.\n6\n\n7\n\nFor more discussion, see May 19, 2020 remarks by Eric S. Rosengren, entitled: The Main Street Lending Program\nand Other Federal Reserve Actions.\n8\n\nIt is worth noting, as I have in prior talks, that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged prior to\nCOVID-19, due in part to the rise of online retail and firms like Amazon.com.\n9\n\nFor more on the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, see https://www.bostonfed.org/mslp.\n\n10\n\nThese analysis are descriptive and, therefore, do not suggest causality, nor control for firm-specific characteristics.\nAs previously noted, the analysis is preliminary and based on work being conducted by FRB Boston staff.\n11\n\nAnd if workers and firms are less able to adjust and adapt, that makes the recession more severe. For more\ndiscussion, see Oct. 8, 2020 remarks by Eric S. Rosengren, entitled Economic Fragility: Implications for Recovery\nfrom the Pandemic.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Central Time) on Thursday, October\n8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Economic Fragility: Implications for\nRecovery from the Pandemic”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nMarburg Memorial Lecture\nMarquette University Economics Department\n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today, albeit,\nvirtually. I particularly regret not being able to meet with you in person, given the many years I\nenjoyed living and visiting Wisconsin – first as a graduate student at University of WisconsinMadison, and then later, when visiting my daughter during her four years in medical school at\nthe Medical College of Wisconsin.\nI am honored to join the ranks of economists you have invited to give the Marburg\nMemorial Lecture at Marquette University. Perhaps appropriately, most of the previous speakers\nhave been distinguished academics. Today, I share with you the perspectives I’ve gained from a\ndifferent role, which is that of a policymaker.\nThe stated goal of the Marburg Memorial Lecture is to provide a forum for the discussion\nof moral, philosophical, and social dimensions of economic issues.1 Economists discuss the\nsocial dimensions of economic issues all too rarely. At this time, in the grip of a worldwide\npandemic, the breadth of the effect of the virus on society has made COVID-19 of crucial\nconcern to many disciplines, and economics is certainly no exception. It is an essential time for\neconomists to be considering the social implications of economic policy, as the nation remains\naffected by a virus that has taken more than 210,000 lives. As we head into the colder months,\nwe continue to see a high rate of positive COVID cases across the country (including a\ntroublingly high infection rate in Wisconsin and much of the Midwest), which underscores that\nthe human tragedy of the pandemic continues to unfold even as the economy has reopened and\nimproved noticeably.\nIt is important to note that both the negative public health effects, and economic\nrepercussions, of the pandemic have not been felt evenly in society. The virus itself has\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndisproportionately affected minorities who, statistically, tend to live in more dense urban areas\nand rely on public transportation to get to work, and who are more likely to be employed as\nfrontline and essential workers. Such jobs cannot easily be performed remotely, and despite\nbeing deemed essential, often involve modest pay. In addition, these workers are often in\nservice-related industries that have been particularly hard-hit by the crisis, and so they have been\ndisproportionally affected by job losses.2\nUnfortunately, the uneven effects of recessions are not unique to the current one. But the\ncurrent situation is severe. As the pandemic is dragging on, and consumers remain wary of\nengaging in activity that requires close social contact – restaurants, hotels, and retailers are\nbeginning to close – with the consequence of permanent job losses for the typically lower-wage\nworkers in these industries.3\nBusinesses closing, making job losses permanent, is one example of the so-called\nrecessionary dynamics that often take hold during an economic downturn.4 Importantly, the state\nof the economy as it enters a downturn – especially the health of the financial system – can play\nan important role in recessionary dynamics and how the recessionary burden is spread across the\neconomy.\nIn my remarks today, I will explore an economic issue that definitely has social and even\nmoral dimensions and implications, consistent with the Marburg lecture series – whether the\nUnited States economy, as currently configured, is particularly vulnerable to economic\ndisruptions and in turn those recessionary burdens. In terms of this vulnerability to disruptions,\nit is possible that no one could have predicted that a worldwide pandemic would occur precisely\nin 2020 – but one could have anticipated that having highly levered firms and excessive\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconcentrations of commercial real estate lending at some institutions would make the economy\nmore vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including a pandemic or other shock.\nYou might be wondering why I would bring up losses from financial instability in the\nsame breath as the pandemic and its uneven economic and public health burdens. I do so\nbecause losses due to financial shocks affect a wide range of stakeholders – not only\nshareholders, but also of course the workers in the affected industries. A wave of unnecessary\nbankruptcies resulting from such shocks can cause a spike in permanent job loss and a significant\nscarring of labor market participants – particularly, though not exclusively, those at the lower\nend of the income distribution. These lower-wage workers, who tend to have little if any\nfinancial cushions, are the individuals least prepared to endure an economic downturn.\nAmerican novelist Ernest Hemingway famously – and succinctly – captures some of my\nconcerns in this dialogue from his breakout novel, The Sun Also Rises: “’How did you go\nbankrupt?’ Bill asked. ‘Two ways,’ Mike said. ‘Gradually and then suddenly.’” Many\nbusinesses are, unfortunately, facing the “suddenly” part right now. In recent years, many of\nthese firms had gradually increased risk by taking on more leverage, which magnifies returns\nwith good outcomes – but also magnifies losses when bad outcomes occur.5\nThis increase in risk-taking is more likely to take place in a low-interest environment,\nlike the one which prevailed in the aftermath of (and as a result of) the financial crisis and Great\nRecession. Low interest rates encourage households and firms to accumulate more debt by\nmaking it easier to meet the cash flow needs to service the debt associated with buying a house\nor making a business (capital) investment, or even share buybacks by firms. But when a bad\neconomic shock occurs, financial buffers for households and firms alike tend to fall, and the debt\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nservice and potential repayment of the debt can become quite problematic. Financed assets – be\nthey companies or shopping malls – will also lose value in a recession, making it much harder to\nrefinance that debt by taking out a new loan, as might be done in normal times.\nDuring economic downturns, monetary policy accommodation helps to stimulate the\neconomy by lowering interest rates and encouraging households and firms to take more risk – a\ndesired effect during the depths of a recession, when many households and firms become overly\nrisk-averse and limit their spending. (One might think of this as pump-priming to rein in the\ndownward spiral of the economy and initiate a recovery.)\nHowever, there are potential adverse consequences from low rates persisting for an\nextended period even after the economy has made progress in the recovery. Abnormally low\nrates for a long period during times when economic slack is no longer a concern can result in\nexcessive risk-taking, as businesses and firms take on additional debt and accumulate more risky\nassets in search of better returns – potentially bidding up asset prices to unsustainable levels.\nThe financial pressures associated with such behavior build gradually, and only become clear in\nthe next economic downturn. When the ensuing recession occurs, often suddenly, and more\nsevere recessionary dynamics take over, the impact tends to be greatest on workers and firms that\nare least able to adjust and adapt.\nMy remarks today focus on some of the mechanisms that contribute to financial\ninstability and tend to amplify the effects of economic downturns, and how these mechanisms\nare likely to impact the economic recovery. While these observations apply to downturns in\ngeneral, they are certainly relevant in the present particularly challenging episode.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nFirst, I will highlight an important mechanism that plays a role in recessionary\ndynamics – the tightening of credit terms and credit availability during an economic\ndownturn. In part, the importance of this channel is amplified by a low interest rate\nenvironment during the preceding economic expansion when households and firms\naccumulated loans, oftentimes in real estate. A prime example in the current\ndownturn is commercial real estate, where the high leverage build-up before the crisis\nand the severe hit from the crisis have led to a noticeable tightening in credit\nconditions. With tighter credit conditions, it becomes even more difficult to roll over\nmaturing loans, which are plentiful due to the increased leverage.\n\n•\n\nI will then show that low rates for a long period of time not only compound bank\nexposures in real estate, but also increase firms’ reliance on debt, making cash flow\ndisruptions from the pandemic more severe.\n\n•\n\nFinally, I will highlight that this build-up in financial risks has implications for labor\nmarket conditions – which, unfortunately, likely means a slower and more painful\nrecovery than if we had more aggressively addressed the build-up of risks in the\ncorporate and banking sectors prior to the pandemic.\n\nAll of this has important policy implications – for both monetary and supervisory policy.\nFirst, it has implications for how long monetary policy should remain highly accommodative;\nand second, it has implications with respect to the lack of a coherent framework in the United\nStates for conducting supervisory policy that effectively addresses the build-up of financial\nstability risks. Policy improvements in this area should not be seen as dry or abstract notions –\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ngiven the opportunity to make downturns less severe, hasten recoveries, and alleviate some of the\nhuman toll of job losses and economic insecurity.\n\nTightening of Credit Conditions\nThe tightening of credit conditions frequently occurs in economic downturns, as lenders\nbecome more concerned about the ability of borrowers to pay off their loans, and the value of\ncollateral – and become more uncertain about the evolution of the economy more generally.\nFigure 1 shows the results of the bank lending survey for commercial and industrial loans\nconducted by the Federal Reserve. For both large and small borrowers, lending standards have\ntightened appreciably, relative to the time prior to the pandemic, and are currently approaching\nthe peaks we saw in the financial crisis and Great Recession.\nIn Figure 2, it is clear that one major difference between the current pandemic-driven\nrecession and the last recession, at least to date, is the better financial condition of U.S. banks.\nDuring the financial crisis that began in 2007, a large number of bank failures occurred, as banks\nheld too little capital for the shock generated from the fall in real estate prices, particularly as it\ninvolved highly leveraged households.\nEven though bank failures are currently low (Figure 2), and many banks are better\ncapitalized, why are financial conditions tight (Figure 1) at least for commercial and industrial\nlending? One possibility is that as the pandemic drags on, the likelihood of more severe\noutcomes for borrowers, and their lenders, has risen. As uncertainty increases, banks tend to be\nless willing to take on risk, at any price. Also, a significant depletion of capital, even if it does\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nnot cause a bank to fail, can lead to banks tightening their lending standards applied to potential\nborrowers.\nIn particular, falling commercial and residential real estate prices were a major reason for\nlosses on loans during the last financial crisis. Figure 3 shows that of late, nonperforming real\nestate loans have turned up, but have yet to rise dramatically. The most recent data come with a\ncouple of caveats. First, the data tend to lag fairly significantly; the peak in the previous\nrecession was well after the recession ended. Second, and relatedly, many banks reportedly\nprovided their customers forbearance in the spring and summer – including, but not limited to,\nforbearance for real estate loans backed by retail stores or hotels, which have been particularly\nimpacted by the pandemic, and also for residential borrowers through regulatory mandates.6\nBecause of the forbearance, borrowers are meeting current contractual arrangements, but are\nlikely to struggle once the forbearance ends if economic activity remains suppressed by the\npandemic.7\nThis concern with future loan defaults, along with low net interest margins in a lowinterest-rate environment, likely helps explain why bank stock prices have remained so\ndepressed, despite a significant rebound in broader stock indices, as shown in Figure 4. U.S.\nbank stocks are at only 60 percent of their value from the beginning of the year, while the\nbroader S&P 500 stock index is now above levels seen in January.\nIn part, these concerns also focus on the commercial real estate loans made by many\nbanks. As Figure 5 illustrates, the largest banks hold only a little over 5 percent of their assets in\ncommercial real estate loans, while small and mid-sized banks have approximately 25 percent of\ntheir assets in commercial real estate. One reason for this divergence is that large banks with\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmore investment opportunities – and in part, with their CRE portfolio subject to annual stress\ntests that feature adverse scenarios for real estate – have chosen a smaller CRE portfolio relative\nto smaller banks, where CRE lending is often the most straightforward collateralized lending for\nmany small and medium-sized businesses. Over time more commercial real estate loans have\nmigrated to small and medium-sized banks.8\nWhile banking data do not yet reflect significant problems in commercial real estate,\ngiven the forbearance I mentioned and the lagging nature of indicators, we can obtain an\napproximation of likely problems from the recent equity performance of real estate investment\ntrusts. These are companies that seek exposure to specific sectors of the commercial real estate\nmarket. As Figure 6 shows, equity indices focused on two commercial real estate sectors – retail\nreal estate and hotel real estate are particularly depressed since the pandemic hit. For example,\nthe hotels and resorts REIT index is at about 50 percent of its pre-pandemic level. I would add\nthat many of the loans in bank portfolios are more likely to be smaller hotels and retail strip\nmalls, which might have been even more adversely impacted by the pandemic than their larger\npeers, given their lack of direct access to bond and equity markets.9\nNote that travel and hotel firms have been hurt by a variety of events over the past 20\nyears. They were depressed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, during the financial\ncrisis of 2007 and 2008, and now. This is an industry where tail events should not be all that\nunexpected. A highly levered hotel can be quite profitable during good times, but during a\nsevere economic downturn may face a significant challenge to survive.\nIt is worth noting that the early 1990s credit crunch, the financial crisis and Great\nRecession, and likely this pandemic-driven recession all provide examples of the prominent role\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreal estate has played as a headwind to recovery due to the losses incurred from real estate assets\nheld inside and outside the banking sector. However, when sectors regularly contribute to the\nseverity of downturns, one wonders whether it is time to note that reaching-for-yield behavior\nduring a low interest rate period may exacerbate a subsequent economic downturn, to the\ndetriment of many people beyond the sector.\n\nBuild-up in Leverage\nFigure 7 shows the build-up in nonfinancial corporate business debt relative to GDP.\nBut for cyclical fluctuations when GDP fell in recessions, the extended low interest rate\nenvironment after the Great Recession helps explain why the leverage ratio rose over the past 10\nyears. Corporations increased their leverage as the prevailing low interest rate environment\nprovided more capacity to take on debt.\nHowever, in an economic downturn, greater leverage – with its principal and interest\nrepayment demands – may prove problematic for firms, or by extension the economy. This can\nresult in firms being forced into bankruptcy, which hurts a wide range of stakeholders in addition\nto lenders and investors, including customers, suppliers, and employees.\nFigure 8 provides an example involving retailers.10 During normal times, retailers can\nhave a relatively predictable revenue stream. This makes it attractive to increase debt, either by\nmanagement decision or as part of a private equity acquisition. However, when the unexpected\noccurs, as the pandemic has shown, it can interrupt firms’ revenue streams, forcing them to slash\nemployment to continue meeting debt service requirements and survive. The figure shows the\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndebt to EBITDA ratios for publicly held retailers with a default in 2020 (retailers whose\nfinancials are publicly available). As shown, most of these firms have a debt to EBITDA ratio\nthat would disqualify them from participation in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending\nProgram (where ratios of four times adjusted EBITDA for loans with less security, and six times\nadjusted EBITDA for loans with more security, represent the maximum allowed debt load).\nLeverage not permissible for a troubled borrower lending program, but standard for many\nretailers prior to the crisis, highlights that the significant build-up of leverage is a contributing\nfactor to the bankruptcies we have already seen – unfortunately with more quite likely in the\ncoming months.\n\nImplications for Labor Markets\nThe firm closures and layoffs associated with recessionary dynamics mean that debates\nabout corporate leverage involve more than issues of finance; they involve the welfare of\nworkers. The build-up in risks in commercial real estate, and leverage in the corporate sector,\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to result in more bankruptcies and higher\nunemployment during this crisis than if less risk had been taken.\nIf the costs for taking on the extra risk were borne only by investors knowingly taking\nthat risk, it might not be so problematic. While less levered businesses still face disruptions in\nthe current environment, they will hopefully recover and rehire workers and re-engage with\nsuppliers and customers. A leveraged business is more likely to declare bankruptcy,\npermanently severing its many formal and informal contracts with customers, suppliers, and\nemployees. The human toll can be immense.\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOf course, large declines in employment in particular sectors of the economy can be\ncostly, and slow to recover from, because workers need to not only find new work but also\npotentially must develop skills for working in a new occupation or industry. While this can\noccur with or without leverage contributing, clearly excessive leverage can exacerbate job losses\nfrom temporary demand shocks, and make the recovery process slower and more painful than it\nwould have been without the leverage.\nFigure 9 shows that since the beginning of the year, the number of employees\npermanently unemployed has risen. Figure 10 shows that long-duration unemployment is on the\nrise. As the pandemic drags on much longer than originally hoped, the likelihood increases that\nmany job losses that firms and employees hoped would be temporary, become permanent. This\nmakes it much more difficult, of course, for the economy to return to full employment.\nNot only does it take time for workers to get retrained and find jobs in new areas, but\nmany workers lose the will to continue looking for work. Such discouragement effects could be\nparticularly prevalent among second earners in a household, and people nearing retirement. We\ncan see this effect with another measure of slack in the labor force, the labor force participation\nrate, shown in Figure 11. As people become discouraged with their prospects for employment,\nthey stop looking for work. As more people are not employed and not looking for work, the\nlabor force participation rate declines. The roughly 2 percentage-point decline in the labor force\nparticipation rate indicates that the labor market recovery may prove challenging. It is also\nnoteworthy that loss of jobs have been concentrated in industries that employ a significant\nnumber of women, and as schools continue to impacted by the pandemic, more women are\nleaving the labor force – possibly in part to address inadequate support for school-age children.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs a reminder of the root cause of all these challenges, Figure 12 shows the COVID-19\ninfection rate in the United States and in Wisconsin. As the figure shows, there are rising\ninfections in many parts of the country, including Wisconsin.\nAddressing the public health crisis is the prerequisite for resolving the economic crisis.11\nThe increases in infections since March, which has already resulted in hundreds of thousands of\ndeaths in the U.S., also has dire economic consequences. Firms and households are unlikely to\nresume pre-pandemic economic activity and spending until the public health situation improves,\nand activities that require close social contact are less of a concern.\n\nConcluding Observations\nClearly a deadly pandemic was bound to badly impact the economy. However, I am\nsorry to say that the slow build-up of risk in the low-interest-rate environment that preceded the\ncurrent recession likely will make the economic recovery from the pandemic more difficult.\nThe increased risk build-up, such as the reaching-for-yield behavior in commercial real\nestate or increased corporate leverage, make economic downturns including this one more\nsevere. These are issues that I and others spoke about quite extensively in the years before the\npandemic hit, in particular with respect to questions about the need for accommodative interest\nrates when the economy was doing well, and the potential for a build-up of financial stability\nrisks.12\nIn the United States, we do not have a cohesive set of regulatory and supervisory tools to\nmoderate risk build-ups. And while we do have the Financial Stability Oversight Council, we do\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nnot have a regulatory and supervisory body endowed with tools and structures that can be\ndeployed to limit financial stability risks – as, for example, the U.K. has.13 If we expect to\nremain in a low-interest-rate environment for a protracted period of time, we need to take more\nprecautions against financial stability risks for when the next economic shock hits.\nAn important area of research, going forward, is to understand how the changes in risktaking behavior have made the economy more susceptible to severe and protracted downturns\nthat resist recovery. The urgency of these topics is underlined by the fact that the economic\nimpact of these downturns is disproportionately borne by those who can least afford it.\nThank you for inviting me to deliver the Marburg Memorial Lecture today. I wish you\ncontinued health during these challenging times, and look forward to the next time I can visit the\ngreat state of Wisconsin.\n\n1\n\nFor more about the Marburg Memorial Lecture, see: https://www.marquette.edu/business/center-forapplied-economics/marburg-lecture.php\n2\n\nWorkers in these sectors who have remained employed, or who have been recalled to previous jobs, also\nface a higher risk of job losses going forward, to the extent that the recovery in industries such as\nhospitality and entertainment proves sluggish as we head into the colder months.\n3\n\nAnother troubling factor this time is the dropout rate of women from the labor force being greater than\nthe typical recession, likely because of the unequal burden sharing between husbands and wives of taking\ncare of children who are schooling at home.\n4\n\nRecessionary dynamics refers to when aggregate demand falls below production so that inventories rise.\nFirms start cutting back production, and laying off employees. In addition, since production exceeds\naggregate demand, inventories keep building for a while and firms have no incentive to invest, so\naggregate demand continues to fall as consumption (due to the increase in unemployment and the fall in\nincomes) and investment fall further.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (11:10 A.M. Central Time) on Thursday, October 8, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n5\n\nFirms can only increase their debt if there are investors that are willing to provide credit to such firms.\nAccordingly, another potential risk of the low interest rate environment is that it encourage investors,\nincluding institutional investors, to reach-for-yield. See, for example, LinaLu, Matthew Pritsker, Andrei\nZlate, Kenechukwu Anadu, and Jim Bohn, “Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension Funds,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, Supervisory Research and Analysis Working Papers 2019,Series 19-2.Other\npapers have found reach-for-yield behavior in other investor types, including insurance companies\n6\n\nBy regulatory mandates I am referring to the requirements for GSE-insured mortgages that lenders allow\nhomeowners to defer mortgage payments.\n7\n\nIt is also the case that small businesses received significant short-term help from fiscal policy; aid that\nhas not been extended or increased as of yet.\n8\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that smaller banks have less ability to diversify in some sectors.\n\nFor context, larger properties tend to be debt/equity financed rather than bank financed – as is often the\ncase for smaller hotels and retail strip malls.\n9\n\n10\n\nIt is worth noting that the traditional retail sector writ large has been challenged for a period of time,\ndue in part to the rise of online retail and the likes of Amazon.com.\nFor more discussion, see: Sept. 23, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economy’s Outlook,\nChallenges, and Way Forward and also August 12, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The COVID-19\nPandemic, the Economic Outlook, and the Main Street Lending Program.\n11\n\nFor more discussion, see: Jan. 13, 2020 talk by Eric Rosengren entitled, The Economic Outlook – and\nTwo Risks to the Forecast that are Worth Watching.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the Boston Economic Club\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to meet with the members of the\nBoston Economic Club, albeit virtually.\nAs we approach the fall, the recent data for the national economy have been better than\nexpected. The reason is quite clear; many states opened up from pandemic shutdowns relatively\nquickly, and economic activity has reflected the benefits of increased personal mobility.\nUnfortunately, we are also seeing the costs of higher mobility on public health outcomes, as\ninfections and deaths from COVID-19 remain elevated.\nIn Massachusetts, until recently, we had the highest state unemployment rate in the\ncountry, at 16.2 percent in July. However, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts fell to 11.3\npercent in August as more businesses have reopened. Notably, over the summer both infection\nand mortality rates have been much lower than in many other parts of the country.1\nOur higher unemployment and lower infection rate have several causes. One is the\nlaudable focus of Massachusetts policymakers on public health, and their unwillingness to trade\noff higher levels of economic activity in the short-term for higher rates of COVID-19 infection.\nHowever, the type of work that is conducted in the state also affects the employment situation.\nA large swath of Greater Boston’s workforce hold white-collar jobs – many of which can be\ndone remotely – so downtown Boston has yet to see most workers return to its office towers.\nWith more workers remaining at home, activity in the downtown area has fallen off significantly.\nThe large support system that developed around these white-collar jobs, consisting of many\ndowntown businesses and their employees, have suffered greatly.\nLooking beyond employment, the consequent sharp reduction in revenues of these\nbusinesses has impaired their ability to make timely rent payments, producing adverse effects on\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlandlords, and eventually their mortgage lenders. The changed working environment and its\n“multiplier effects,” as they emanate through other stakeholders, exemplify some of the\nheadwinds the economy still faces.\nThe Federal Reserve’s response to the initial and ongoing effects of the pandemic has\nbeen swift and multifaceted. As an example, the statement after last week’s meeting of the Fed’s\npolicymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), included new guidance\nregarding interest rate policy.2\nThe statement highlighted that the federal funds rate range is expected to remain at the\ncurrently low level until three conditions are met. First, that the economy reaches maximum\nsustainable employment. Second, that inflation has risen to 2 percent. Third, that inflation is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. These three conditions come with a caveat\nthat no risks emerge that could impede the Fed achieving its dual mandate – such as increased\nfinancial instability. In essence, the Committee is committing to waiting until inflation is above\nits long-run target before normalizing the federal funds rate, unless other important risks become\nsignificant. The lethargy of the inflation rate below the 2 percent target essentially since 2008\nhas made the FOMC willing to overshoot the 2 percent target before normalizing rates, accepting\nthe added risk to financial stability from holding interest rates near zero for an extended period of\ntime.\nLast week FOMC meeting participants also provided their updated forecasts for the\neconomy, in the form of the Summary of Economic Projections – often referred to as the SEP.3\nThe median forecast of the FOMC participants has the unemployment rate dropping to 7.6\npercent by the end of this year, and to 5.5 percent at the end of 2021, along with a gradual return\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof inflation to 2 percent. This outlook constitutes a rapid return to full employment, considering\nthe extent of the downturn from the pandemic this spring.\nUnfortunately, my own forecast is less optimistic.\nWhile I expect the economy to recover in time, my own expectation is that it will be more\ngradual than the median forecast of FOMC participants. The reason for my differing outlook\nhinges on several challenges that, I believe, the economy could face in the coming months. First,\nI am concerned that a second wave of COVID-19 infections this fall and winter is likely, which\ncould cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and face-to-face interactions.\nEven without added restrictions, the added risk of infection from a second wave could sap some\nof the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend and invest. Second, additional support\nfrom fiscal policy, which I believe is very much needed, seems increasingly unlikely to\nmaterialize anytime soon. The occurrence of a second wave could result in more fiscal actions,\nbut their impact on the economy would probably not be realized until early next year. Third, I\nexpect that financial spillovers from businesses impacted by the virus will become a more\nsignificant headwind going forward. Finally, my forecast reflects my concern that workers\ndisplaced by the pandemic may find it difficult to quickly transition to new jobs, with more\nfurloughs turning into permanent layoffs as many businesses remain troubled.\nI certainly hope that this less optimistic outlook turns out to be wrong. But the likelihood\nthat this view is right is why I believe additional fiscal stimulus, and continued monetary\nstimulus, remain necessary – despite some of the encouraging economic data received over the\nsummer. In particular, as concerns monetary policy, it continues to be very important that the\nFederal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities provide support to the economy.4 In my remarks\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntoday, I will briefly discuss the progress on one such facility, the Federal Reserve’s Main Street\nLending Program – including some recent expansions to include multi-borrower loan structures\n(loans made to multiple co-borrowers) and loans to nonprofits, and a recent announcement\nemphasizing that lenders should focus on borrowers’ financial positions before and after the\npandemic as they make their underwriting decisions.5\nBefore I turn to the Main Street Lending Program, however, I’d like to begin with a brief\nsummary of recent economic data and the forecast provided by the FOMC, while highlighting\nsome of the risks and challenges I see in the economic outlook. To preview my conclusion, my\nviews are that the economy remains fragile, that fiscal- and monetary-policy stimulus are\nessential to the recovery, and that policymakers should continue to explore how to reduce\neconomic scarring from this severe pandemic.\n\nExamining the Recent Data\nFigure 1 shows the unemployment rate for the nation since the beginning of the year.\nThe dark blue line shows the standard, widely reported “U-3” measure. The lighter blue line\nshows the unemployment rate corrected for one of the misclassification errors that have been\ndocumented this year.6 In particular, many respondents — especially early on in the pandemic\n— answered the household labor survey by saying they were employed but not at work because\nof the pandemic, when they should actually have stated that they were unemployed on temporary\nlayoff. Even without this adjustment, the U-3 unemployment rate is currently at 8.4 percent,\nwhich is still consistent with a severe recession. This misclassification has become less severe\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwith better reporting efforts and some of the workers being recalled or, unfortunately,\ntransitioning to being permanently unemployed.\nIn addition, other indicators suggest that the headline unemployment rate, even if\nmeasured correctly, may understate the amount of slack in the labor market. Indeed, the labor\nforce participation rate is still almost 2 percentage points lower than it was at the beginning of\nthe year, and the number of individuals reporting that they are working part-time for economic\nreasons remains elevated. While the improvement in the unemployment rate since April is\nencouraging, I believe further progress will be more difficult to achieve until disruptions from\nthe virus become less acute.\nFigure 2 highlights the industries with the most pronounced employment growth since\nMay. These industries are the ones that were most disrupted by the pandemic – such as Retail\nTrade, and Accommodation and Food Services – and are sectors of the economy still impacted\nby consumers’ reticence to engage in activities where they are less confident of being protected\nfrom the virus.\nDespite the recent hiring, Figure 3 shows that employment in these industries remains\ndramatically below levels from the beginning of the year – especially in Arts, Entertainment, and\nRecreation, which is impacted by the lack of group events; and in Accommodation and Food\nServices (hotels and restaurants), which relies on consumers leaving home to make expenditures.\nAmong even those industries that have recovered more significantly, employment still remains\nbelow where it was earlier this year. As a result, while labor markets have improved, the path\nfor further reemployment will not be easy – particularly if a second wave of infections occurs\nand consumers remain reluctant to participate in activities where social distancing is difficult.\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs a result, the most likely labor market outcome seems to me to be continued improvement, but\nwith slower gains in employment than we have experienced since April.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nAs I mentioned, following last week’s FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve released the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), which involves asking each FOMC participant to\nprovide their forecast for key economic variables. Figure 4 shows the median SEP forecast, and\nthe central tendency, for the unemployment rate. The median of the participants’ forecasts has\nunemployment ending the year at 7.6 percent, falling to 5.5 percent by the end of 2021, and then\ndropping down to 4.6 percent by the end of 2022.\nAlthough some of this improvement has already occurred, the expected decline would\nrepresent a rapid recovery from the pandemic’s severe employment effects. Despite this\nprojected pattern of a swift improvement in labor markets, Figure 5 shows that FOMC\nparticipants forecast only a gradual return to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation goal. The\nmedian of the SEP projections has inflation still at 1.8 percent at the end of 2022, despite the\naccompanying forecast of tightening labor markets.\nThe rapid improvement in the unemployment rate is facilitated by unusually low interest\nrates. The median of the SEP forecasts for the interest rate through 2023 is unchanged at its\ncurrent target range, as shown in Figure 6. This is consistent with the forward guidance that I\ndiscussed at the outset of my remarks, where Fed policymakers stated their intention to wait to\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nraise rates until the economy has reached maximum sustainable employment, and inflation is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\nAll told, the median SEP projection is a relatively optimistic forecast. The\nunemployment rate falls to 4.6 percent by 2022, and inflation reaches 2 percent in 2023. As I\nnoted earlier, my own view is less optimistic, because I believe that the path of the pandemic will\ncontinue to present challenges that represent significant headwinds to economic growth.\n\nChallenges to the Economy and the Forecast\nThe biggest challenge to the economy, and the risk to a more optimistic forecast,\ncontinues to be our inability in the United States to achieve the public health progress on the\nvirus seen in many other developed countries. Figure 7 shows new infection rates for the United\nStates in dark blue, new infections for Massachusetts in light blue, and new infections for G7\ncountries (excluding the U.S.) in green. Starting with Massachusetts, the infections per million\npopulation peaked in April, and then declined significantly as the state imposed strong\nrestrictions to reduce the infection rate. To date, we have been able to avoid a large resurgence\nof the virus in Massachusetts, with infections rising only a bit higher than the lows reached in\nJune. In contrast, national infections were much more subdued in March and April, but\nincreased significantly as many states re-opened very quickly, with few restrictions, causing a\nsurge in infections. Thankfully, those infections have moderated nationally, but remain well\nabove the levels in Massachusetts. The G7 countries, excluding the U.S., show a dramatically\ndifferent situation, with their new cases per million population peaking in late March at a much\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlower level than either Massachusetts or the U.S. as a whole went on to achieve – and remaining\nlow throughout the summer.\nDespite the overall progress nationally since the July peak, the virus has tended to surge\nin areas that previously had relatively low infection rates. Figure 8 shows three states in the\nNorthern Midwest that have recently experienced a surge – possibly triggered by less restrictions\non, or higher aversions to, wearing masks and social distancing, despite a number of large group\nevents. These patterns of infections emphasize the need to be vigilant, particularly as more\nactivities move inside this fall and winter.\nFigure 9 shows the forecasted effect of the virus over the remainder of this year, based\non the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model that is maintained at the\nUniversity of Washington.7 While this is only one model-based projection, it broadly reflects the\nconsensus of many experts and the experiences of past pandemics, that the fall and winter are\nlikely to result in a resurgence of the virus. Because community spread is not contained, and\nregional flare-ups are still occurring, one has to be concerned about reductions in restrictions on\nmobility at a time when schools are back in session and colder weather is returning.\nOf course, the outlook from the IHME model could likely be improved by more careful\npersonal behaviors, such as social distancing and wearing masks, or by states clamping down on\nmobility in the face of rising infection rates. Still, the model highlights that a second wave is\ncertainly possible if we do not take sufficient precautions. Due to projections such as this one,\nmy economic forecast is predicated on individuals and firms still being constrained significantly\nby community spread of the virus this fall and winter.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIf increased infection rates occur during the fall, as I expect, it will exacerbate other\neconomic and financial headwinds that I anticipate will be more apparent in the last four months\nof this year. Figure 10 shows the delinquency rates associated with different real estate asset\nclasses so far this year, based on data reported on collateralized mortgage-backed securities or\nCMBS. Moving forward, even conservatively underwritten properties will likely face challenges\nif consumers are afraid to shop in stores and stay in hotels through the fall and winter. So far,\nthese fears have more clearly manifested themselves in the data from CMBS markets; already\nover 25 percent of hotel properties are delinquent, and close to 20 percent of retail properties are\nin arrears. Moreover, the CMBS market data may actually be underestimating the problems in\nthese sectors, as it disproportionately accounts for larger properties. Smaller hotels and retail\nstrip malls, which are more likely to be financed by small and medium-sized banks, are likely to\nbe even more severely impacted – although data on delinquencies from the summer are not yet\navailable.\nIn contrast, office and multifamily commercial real estate loans currently have low\ndelinquencies. However, an important issue for both of these sectors is rollover risk. Given that\nmost multifamily properties have one-year leases, the costs arising from a wave of non-renewing\ntenants become clear only at lease renewal times. An inability to fill the resulting vacancies\ncould lead to an increase in mortgage delinquencies for these properties.\nFigure 11 shows that such stresses are already showing up in major cities, in terms of\nvacancy and rental rates. Data from Costar, which calculates daily vacancy rates and rental\nprices for apartments in major cities, show rapidly rising vacancy rates and fairly sharp declines\nin rents in several major cities. Particularly challenged are expensive cities like Boston and San\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFrancisco, shown in the figure, and Los Angeles. The decline in rents is more abrupt than we\nwould normally see in a more traditional (non-pandemic) economic downturn, and may be\nindicative of more substantial problems on the horizon. Similarly, office properties have longerterm leases, so the stresses in that market will likely become apparent only over time. However,\nan open question remains – whether there will be structural changes in downtown office space as\na result of a prolonged period with many employees working from home.\nThe reason to focus so much attention on commercial real estate is because real estate\nprices were inflated by reaching-for-yield behavior as low interest rates persisted during the\nrecovery from the Great Recession. A structural shock, like the pandemic, can result in a\nsignificant increase in the number of nonperforming loans, eventually impinging the ability of\nbanks and insurance companies to continue to make credit available to borrowers. Hence, I am\nespecially worried about a “second shoe dropping” that will particularly affect small and\nmedium-sized banks, which provide a large share of commercial real estate loans and small\nbusiness loans. A curtailment of credit resulting from such problems has caused serious\nheadwinds to recoveries in the past, and may be a serious problem going forward.\nFigure 12 shows that, unfortunately, challenges from the pandemic are likely to extend to\nthe labor market. If many hotels, restaurants, and retail firms declare bankruptcy, workers in\nthese sectors will have to search for new employers, and possibly new industries for\nemployment. The industries most impacted by the pandemic tend to be large employers of\nwomen, minorities, and young people, as the figure illustrates. The ability to retrain for jobs\nwith different employers or in different industries can take time, and I worry that these employeremployee matching challenges will result in a slower labor market recovery than what is implied\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nby the median unemployment-rate outlook in the SEP. However, fiscal policy actions, like the\ncreation of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or emergency Federal Reserve programs, like the\nMain Street Lending Program, could help moderate the numbers of firms that close.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program\nThe Main Street Lending Program, the MSLP, was designed to provide support to firms\nthat had been profitable before the pandemic, expect to be profitable after the pandemic\ndisruptions abate, but have been severely impacted during the pandemic. This “bridging”\nconcept is entirely appropriate and beneficial given the presumably temporary disruptions in\nactivity and revenue while the pandemic is present. These kinds of bridge loans also tend to be\nscarce during crises, particularly for small and medium-sized firms.8\nThe MSLP involves the Federal Reserve purchasing 95 percent participations in loans to\nfor-profit companies or nonprofit entities – loans that have been underwritten by a bank, which\nretains 5 percent of the loan. The program is attractive to borrowers because the interest rate is 3\npercentage points over LIBOR – and requires no payment of interest until year two, and no\npayment of principal until year three. Also, principal payments are back-loaded, at 15 percent in\nyears three and four, and 70 percent in year five – allowing time for the pandemic to pass and\nbusiness activity and revenue streams to revive. The program should be attractive to banks, both\nbecause of the fees collected and because it reduces the risk to the bank of a borrower that was\nimpacted by the pandemic, given that the Federal Reserve holds 95 percent of the loan. Hence,\nthe MSLP allows banks to help maintain vital credit flows in their local market, which avoids\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nspreading bankruptcies and permanent layoffs, and preserves the economic fabric in\ncommunities.\nThroughout my career as a researcher and policymaker, I have studied the ways that\ncredit interruptions and problems in essential financial flows have pernicious and snowballing\neffects on the businesses and organizations that are essential actors in local economies, and the\npeople that work for those entities. The Main Street program brings a solution – a backstop to\nthat problem – given the Federal Reserve’s ability to take on 95 percent of the loans. I continue\nto urge the nation’s financial institutions to work with the Federal Reserve to help provide a\nbridge for pandemic-affected businesses and nonprofits to better times, avoiding more lasting\neconomic damage to communities and workers.9\nImportantly, I would note that there has been some confusion about the appropriate\nunderwriting standards that a bank should apply to the loans in the program. The Federal\nReserve recently provided new clarifying FAQs encouraging banks to focus on borrower status\nboth before and after the pandemic when considering whether a borrower is appropriate for the\nprogram. We also published an FAQ that clarifies how the loan should be treated by bank\nsupervisors, with all three federal regulators agreeing on the clarification. Hopefully, these\ndevelopments will encourage some banks to more actively engage with borrowers impacted by\nthe pandemic, using the Main Street program.\nAs shown in Figure 13, the Main Street Program as of Monday night has $2 billion in\nloans that have been accepted and $2.4 billion in loans that have been completed or are actively\nbeing considered in the portal. We have seen an increased flow of loans as banks and borrowers\nbecome more familiar with the program. The Main Street Lending Program has recently been\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmade available to nonprofit borrowers, and the portal now accepts loans with multiple coborrowers. The program will continue to evolve as the Board of Governors and Treasury\nevaluate needs for any additional changes to the program.\nFigure 14 shows the top states where Main Street program loans have been completed or\nare under review. The states are generally areas that were impacted more severely by the\npandemic over the summer, and some of the larger states by population.\nHowever, an important component has been banks’ willingness to participate in the\nprogram. Figure 15 shows that relatively few banks have made more than 10 loans (shown as a\nsquare) and the banks making at least six loans in the Main Street Program have been banks with\nassets under $20 billion. None of the nation’s largest banks, by this metric, are currently active\nin the program.\n\nConcluding Observations\nRecent economic data have been encouraging, but I believe the most difficult part of the\nrecovery is still ahead of us. A full recovery probably requires the availability of vaccines and\nmore effective treatments for the virus because until then, many businesses and households are\nunlikely to return to more normal spending habits. While I anticipate a slowly improving\neconomy, economic activity still faces serious headwinds. Potential financial impediments and\nchallenges in the labor market make the recovery process more gradual than any of us would\nprefer.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 23, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nImprovement in the economy will depend importantly on the progress we make in\nmitigating and treating the virus. Until a vaccine is widely available, it is appropriate to have\nhighly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy is pursuing new and\nimaginative ways to deal with the effects of this pandemic. However, my view is that additional\nfiscal policy is probably the more effective tool at this time, since it can directly allocate money\nto firms and businesses most impacted by COVID-19 without requiring them to take on\nadditional debt that must be repaid.\nThank you for having me to speak with you today. I hope you all stay well, and I look\nforward to our next gathering – hopefully – being in person.\n\n1\n\nMassachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in July at 16.2 percent. In August, it saw the most improvement\namong states, falling 4.9 percentage points to 11.3 percent. The highest unemployment rate in August was Nevada,\nat 13.2 percent.\n2\n\nSee September 16, 2020 statement of the Federal Open Market Committee:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm\n3\n\nSee, Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee release economic projections from the\nSeptember 15-16 FOMC meeting:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916b.htm\nThe Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, for example, is a facility authorized by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the\nSecretary of the Treasury.

Some workers who are categorized as not in the\nlabor force are workers who want a job but are not looking for work as a result of the pandemic. If they were\nlooking for a job they would be classified as unemployed, resulting in yet a higher unemployment rate.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:05 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. Thank you for inviting me to address the South Shore Chamber of\nCommerce. While it is unfortunate that we cannot be together for this event, I am grateful that\ntechnology allows us to gather virtually.\n\nPublic Health and Economic Effects\nThis continues to be a challenging time, with the high rate of positive COVID-19 cases\nand resulting deaths across the country highlighting the unfolding human tragedy of the\npandemic. In addition to a tragic loss of life, the pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented\nshock to the U.S. economy.\nThe inability, thus far, to control the virus in the United States is resulting in renewed\nrestrictions on individuals and businesses in many parts of the country. While vital and\nnecessary for the good of the economy in the longer run, the ongoing social distancing in\nresponse to the virus’s spread will continue to complicate policymakers’ task of supporting the\neconomy in the short run with fiscal and monetary policy. As the Federal Reserve’s July Federal\nOpen Market Committee statement highlighted, “The path of the economy will depend\nsignificantly on the course of the virus.” 1\nEven as official restrictions relax, many people may prefer to continue avoiding activities\nthat require social interaction in order to protect their own health. With such a pattern of\nbehavior taking hold, momentum in the economy toward returning quickly to full employment\nwould likely fade. Being cautious during a pandemic is absolutely the right thing to do, and all\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof this highlights that we must get the virus under control in order for a sustainable economic\nrecovery to take hold.\nThe New England region currently has COVID-19 infection rates below those prevailing\nin many parts of the country, including the South and the West. Recently, however, New\nEngland infection numbers have been gradually increasing. Certainly, common sense\nprecautions – such as wearing masks when around other people, maintaining safe social distance,\nand avoiding crowded indoor settings – are much less costly than having to shut down whole\nsectors of the economy again. It is, therefore, important that everyone continue to take steps to\nprotect public health in order to avoid more tragic outcomes along with further economic pain.\nThis is especially true at a time when some colleges and universities are resuming in-person\nclasses, and some K-12 school districts are planning to bring students back together this fall –\nwhen there will be less ability to congregate outdoors.\nToday I would like to begin my remarks by reviewing the current state of the U.S.\neconomy, and I will then discuss some of the steps that the Fed is taking to address the crisis and\nmitigate its impacts on both financial markets and the real economic activity of American\nhouseholds and businesses.\nIn this crisis, which finds little precedent in our lifetimes, both monetary and fiscal\npolicymakers have moved aggressively to offset some of the economic impact of the pandemic.\nPolicy actions this year have been large and timely, reflecting the urgency of the risks that the\ncontinuing public health crisis poses. Specifically, the federal government has expanded its\nusual programs to help individuals during a downturn, such as making unemployment benefits\nmore widely available and increasing the payouts, as well as providing direct payments to lower2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nincome individuals. Keeping this segment of the economy afloat, by providing a financial bridge\nuntil economic conditions normalize, will play an important role in the recovery.2\nIn addition, one of the segments of the economy heavily impacted by the pandemic has\nbeen small and medium-sized businesses, which together employ a very sizable share of the\nworkforce. Many small and medium-sized businesses had to close down operations when\nquarantine restrictions were put in place in the spring and simply cannot fully recover until the\npandemic has abated.\nAs one measure to address this concern, in early July the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston, on behalf of the Federal Reserve System, opened the Main Street Lending Program, or\nMSLP, which aims to help facilitate credit flows that can provide a bridge for small and\nmedium-sized businesses until better economic times arrive. Because activity in the facility will\ndepend, to a significant degree, on the path of the economy and the virus, I expect utilization to\nincrease as we get into the fall. I will say more about this later in my remarks.\nDespite the sizeable interventions by monetary and fiscal policymakers, high-frequency\neconomic data indicate that the recovery may be losing steam, as activities in many states are\nonce again restricted (officially or voluntarily) to slow the virus’s spread. Particularly in some\nparts of the South and the West, where some hospitals are reaching their ICU capacity, changes\nin behavior are showing up in high frequency data on individuals’ mobility and spending.\nClearly, continued stimulative monetary and fiscal policy are critical, and most importantly\nslowing down the COVID-19 infection rate.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Outlook for the Economy\nA notable feature of this recession is how aggressively policymakers have responded.\nFigure 1 shows the path of real disposable personal income since January 2000. Generally, the\ndata fall on a relatively consistent line, and you see relatively small changes around the periods\nof recession shading. However, in this recession, there has been a substantial increase in real\ndisposable income. This reflects the extraordinary amount of fiscal action taken to offset the\nimpact of the virus. Fiscal policy has provided many individuals with substantial financial\nsupport, as befits an unprecedented crisis.\nThe extraordinary fiscal relief provided to households, however, has translated only\nmodestly into spending. Figure 2 shows a striking rise in the personal saving rate – a far bigger\njump than we have seen at any time since World War II. Several factors account for this surge in\nsaving. First, with both required and voluntary social distancing, and less willingness or ability\nof many people to pursue certain activities – such as travelling, attending entertainment events\nwith crowds, or eating indoors at restaurants – spending will likely be lower relative to the past,\nuntil activities involving social interaction entail substantially less public health risks. Second,\nsaving may have risen for some because of the concern about the prospects for worse economic\ncircumstances and less fiscal support going forward. In all, the increase in saving is a reminder\nof the importance of containing the pandemic in order to achieve a more robust recovery.\nAlong with fiscal policy, monetary policy reacted quickly and decisively. Short-term\ninterest rates were quickly dropped to close to zero in March and, as Figure 3 shows, the 10-year\nTreasury yield is well below the level reached during the financial crisis of 2008-9 and Great\nRecession. In addition, the Fed has deployed a variety of emergency credit facilities designed to\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmaintain the availability of credit to firms and individuals. Based on many decades of research\nand policymaking, I can attest that credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm\nindividuals and firms on “main streets” across America.3 So these credit facilities implemented\nby the central bank are very important, and welcome.\nWith such substantial deployment of fiscal and monetary policies, one might expect a\nrobust recovery. Unfortunately, as long as the virus poses significant threats to public health, a\nfull economic recovery will be very difficult as individuals, often voluntarily, avoid activities\nthat place their health at risk. The increased saving rate, reflecting a falloff in consumption\ndespite substantial fiscal transfers to individuals, illustrates the challenges the recovery faces.\nIndeed, the trajectory of the economic recovery will be determined more by the path of the virus\nthan by the path of policymaking, although monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate, and have\nmitigated, some of the most significant adverse impacts to the economy.\n\nRecent Data, and the Pandemic’s Effect on the Economy\nFigure 4 illustrates one of the challenges in achieving a full, and timely, economic\nrecovery by comparing new COVID-19 cases per million in the European Union with those in\nthe United States. While both the EU, which I’ll refer to here as Europe, and the United States\nhad significant increases in infection rates during the spring, Europe enacted more stringent\neconomic shutdowns and limits on individuals’ mobility that were maintained over a longer\nperiod. As a result, their infection rates fell faster and further, and have remained relatively low.\nIn contrast, in the United States, infection rates remain elevated, as states lifted protective\nmeasures too soon and in a manner not calibrated for the true risks posed by the virus. For the\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncountry as a whole, the infection rate is much higher than in the spring, and stands in sharp\ncontrast to the level of infections in Europe.\nFigure 5 compares new COVID-19 death rates in the United States and the European\nUnion. The chart shows that deaths per million in population have been rising and are\nconsiderably higher in the U.S. than in Europe. The U.S. death rate from the virus remains\nbelow its peak in the spring – in part, many suspect, because younger patients have accounted for\nmore of the infections, and also because hospital treatments have improved. Nonetheless, the\nrising death rate could become more severe if infections that start with younger people spread to\nmore vulnerable individuals over time.\nFigure 6 shows cumulative deaths per million people from the virus in Europe and the\nUnited States. While Europe had more cumulative deaths than the U.S. through March and\nApril, cumulative deaths in the United States have now far surpassed those in Europe. The\nreason, I would argue, is highlighted in Figure 7, which shows the change in visits to retail and\nrecreational locations in the U.S. and select countries in Europe. The pattern of the visits\nillustrates how Europe shut down more forcefully, maintained restrictions longer, and did not reopen until the virus had reached low levels. As a result of this more successful virus\ncontainment policy, visits by Europeans to retail and recreation locations have now experienced\na more robust recovery compared with American visits to such locations and are close to their\npre-pandemic levels.\nAdditional evidence of the costs of early re-opening of the U.S. economy – in economic\nand public health terms – can be seen in data on infections, mobility and consumer spending\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nacross states, as highlighted in my next four charts. They demonstrate various facets of the\ninteractions between the virus and the economy.\nFigure 8 plots the states based on two factors – first, the level of mobility within each\nstate (as measured by cellphones coming in close proximity to one another) at the end of May\nand beginning of June, relative to February (pre-pandemic); and second by the change in the\ntypes of spending that are sensitive to social distancing, in May versus April. Spending that is\nsensitive to social distancing involves sectors such as travel, hotels, restaurants, and certain\npersonal care services like beauty salons and barber shops. What we see is evidence of the initial\neconomic benefit in states that became less restrictive earlier. The regression line shows the\ncorrelation – spending in May was stronger, relative to pre-pandemic levels, in those states that\nhad more mobility (contacts) and less restrictions on economic activity.\nBut, unfortunately, that benefit was short-lived.\nFigure 9 compares the same mobility measure for each state to the percentage change in\ninfections in July. The regression line highlights the overall relationship – more mobility in a\nstate through June is generally correlated with larger recent increases in infection rates in July.\nIn particular, states in the Northeast typically experienced much less mobility through June, but\nalso much lower growth in infections in July than many states in the South and West.\nThe lower recent growth in infections in some states is in turn associated with greater\nrecent mobility. Figure 10 compares the percent change in COVID-19 infections in July with\nthe change in mobility (contacts) in the same period. The Northeastern states now have smaller\nincreases in infections and higher mobility, as lower infection rates support more mobility. In\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncontrast, Southern and Western states now have more infections and less mobility, as people\nreduce contacts both voluntarily and because of increased restrictions on economic activity.\nFinally, Figure 11 shows that the monthly growth rate in July spending was ultimately\nmuch better in the previously more restrictive and slower to reopen states in the Northeast\nrelative to many Southern and Western states. Specifically, the figure plots the change in\nCOVID-19 cases in July versus the change in social-distancing-sensitive spending in July.\nTaken together, these data show that states that re-opened early and quickly lifted\nrestrictions saw a short-term increase in activity, but it was at a cost – rising rates of infections,\nwhich resulted in less spending more recently. In short, lifting restrictions too early and too\nquickly hurt both the economy and public health down the road. In the Northeast, where\nrestrictions were more substantial and lasted longer, states are now experiencing both better\npublic health outcomes and more spending in sectors of the economy that are sensitive to social\ndistancing. These results are somewhat parallel to the differences in outcomes between Europe\nand the U.S.\nDespite some states achieving a recent reprieve from COVID-19 infections, it is of course\nimportant to remain vigilant, given the ease of spread of the virus due to the ease of travel across\nstate borders. Recent slight upticks in states like Massachusetts and countries like Germany –\nwhich have taken the pandemic seriously – bear watching. Going forward, states should be\ncarefully calibrating their actions to data, especially as we reach the fall with schools opening\nand more activities moving inside as the seasons change. Failure to take quick actions to\nsuppress the virus could result in more severe economic outcomes as well as the unnecessary\nloss of life.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAn Update on the Main Street Lending Program\nAs I noted earlier, the path of the economy depends heavily on the path of the virus. No\neconomic policy action can fully offset the public health crisis, but it can help limit its impact on\nthe economy.\nAn important economic policy action designed to mitigate current and potential economic\neffects of the pandemic is the Main Street Lending Program, which seeks to facilitate the\ncontinued flow of credit to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial\ncondition prior to the pandemic, but have been adversely impacted by it. The program is\nattractively structured for many businesses facing cash-flow interruptions due to the pandemic by\nfacilitating 5-year loans with no payment of interest in the first year and no payment of principal\nuntil the third year. It is attractive for lenders because they can meet the credit needs of creditworthy companies and nonprofit organizations in their markets while retaining only 5 percent of\nthe loan on their books, with the Federal Reserve taking a 95 percent participation interest in the\nloan.\nWith the program, the Fed is aiming to help creditworthy businesses and nonprofits that\nhave suffered temporary cash-flow problems due to the pandemic, and, given the uncertain\noutlook, might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit from a lender that would have to\nhold 100 percent of the loan. The Main Street program can provide essential financing to help\nthese entities avoid shutting their doors and permanently laying off their employees.\nFigure 12 shows that there are currently 522 lenders registered in the program. Banks of\nall sizes have enrolled, with the greatest number of banks in the $1-10 billion range, although\nsmaller community banks and larger universal banks have also signed up.\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne concern raised by potential borrowers about the program was that their bank might\nnot be participating in the program and, if that were the case, how could they find a bank willing\nto take on a new customer and work with them on a Main Street loan. In response, we have\nmade available an interactive map on our website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp, which provides a\nlist of all participating banks in each state that are currently accepting loan applications from new\ncustomers and that have agreed to be announced to the public. There are currently 160 banks on\nthis list; Figure 13 provides a view of the banks in Massachusetts that are part of this subset of\nregistered lenders.\nBy the way, while participation on any level in the MSLP is voluntary – registering,\nworking with existing customers, or taking on new customers – I strongly encourage additional\nbanks to consider joining those already registered and those on our list accepting new customers.\nWe have seen tremendous interest from potential borrowers experiencing a pandemic-related,\ntemporary disruption of their businesses. Financial institutions have a vested interest in the\ncontinued viability of local businesses and organizations, and the vibrancy of their local\neconomy. The Fed is eager to work with lenders and help them as they provide credit to their\nborrowers. Given the unprecedented crisis brought on by the pandemic, it is important that the\nFederal Reserve take extraordinary measures to help “main street” businesses.\nImportantly, additional debt may not be right for every business and organization at this\nchallenging time, but I would encourage businesses that have been disrupted by the pandemic\nand are in need of financing to explore the program. On the Boston Fed’s website, at\nwww.bostonfed.org/mslp, you can learn more about the terms and conditions of the program,\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ninquire with banks in your network to see if they are participating, and if not consult the\ninteractive map for lenders in your state accepting applications for new customers.\nFor many, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address cash flow interruption\nushered in by the pandemic. Of course, bank loans are contracts between borrowers and banks,\nand the negotiations for loans can take some time and effort. As a result, when the program was\nlaunched in early July, there were relatively few Main Street program loans submitted for\nparticipation purchase. As borrowers and banks have become more familiar with the program,\nwe have seen a steady increase in banks submitting loans to our portal.\nFigure 14 shows that there are currently more than $856 million in loans active in the\nportal, with more than $250 million in loans committed or settled. Much of the increase has\noccurred recently, and I expect we will continue to see more activity as more firms are impacted\nby the pandemic. Unfortunately, should the fall bring a resurgence of the virus as many\nepidemiological models predict, this program may become even more essential.\nSome seem eager to suggest that the Main Street program’s modest initial activity is\nevidence of failure. I completely disagree, and allow me to explain why.\nThe Program differs from other programs for businesses made possible by the CARES\nAct, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is authorized by Congress to do.\nUnlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans could turn into grants funded by the\nCARES Act, the Main Street program involves loans that must be repaid. These loans are\nnegotiated between the borrower and lender, designed to meet the special needs or circumstances\nof a particular borrower, and must be underwritten by the lender. A grant program, or a lending\nprogram with even more generous terms, would of course have faster uptake. But MSLP’s\ndesign, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, in conjunction with the\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTreasury, can indeed support the flow of vital credit to many firms and nonprofit organizations.\nThe Federal Reserve and Treasury have sought to design a program that is well managed with\nrespect to risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being responsive to the needs of borrowers\nexperiencing difficult times.\nIndeed, designing and operationalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered\nthrough secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time. Everyone\ninvolved is focused on the public service goal of helping to provide important credit support to\nbusinesses and nonprofits at this critical and challenging period. Quickly scaling up a program\nthat purchases a large portion of existing loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a\ndecentralized market that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult. There are also tradeoffs\nbetween limiting credit risk, ensuring that operations are safe and secure, reaching scale, and\nachieving operational efficiency.\nAs a reminder, the program opened for loan purchases on July 6. The numbers to date\nseem to me consistent with what I would characterize as a gradual pace of initial activity that is\nmore recently expanding as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters.\nIt is important that the Federal Reserve stands ready at this time of distress, in the public\ninterest and in pursuit of our Congressional mandates, to facilitate lending to for-profit\nbusinesses and nonprofit organizations of many sizes at reasonable rates. As I mentioned at the\noutset, credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm individuals and businesses on\nmain streets across America. The Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole see the Main\nStreet Lending Program as one way to do all we can to support the businesses, nonprofits, and\nindividuals that make up our nation’s economy.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nUnfortunately, the economic outlook is being driven by the course of the pandemic, and\nmuch depends on how successfully it can be contained, either through public health or medical\ninnovations. The forecast for the U.S. economy this fall is quite uncertain, but my view is that\nthe recent slowdown in economic activity that we have seen in high frequency data is likely to\ncontinue. Currently, we have an unemployment rate above 10 percent, and because of the\ncontinued community spread of the virus, I am concerned that the pandemic will limit the ability\nof the economy to recover quickly. As a result, an increasing number of those who are currently\ntemporarily unemployed may ultimately have to face permanent layoffs and the difficult task of\nfinding a new job in a changed economic environment.\nAt the Fed, we are focused on doing all in our power and purview to support the\neconomy, including through efforts we are very proud of, like the Main Street program that again\nI recommend lenders, businesses, and nonprofits explore participating in.\nWhile the fiscal and monetary stimulus has been significant, it cannot fully offset the\neconomic drain caused by the public health crisis. Limited or inconsistent efforts by states to\ncontrol the virus based on public health guidance are not only placing citizens at unnecessary\nrisk of severe illness and possible death – but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn.\nThank you for having me today. I wish you all continued good health during these\nchallenging times.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:10 A.M.

            "content": "Eric S. Rosengren, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPrepared Testimony for the Congressional Oversight Commission\nAugust 7, 2020\n\nMembers of the Commission – Representative Hill, Mr. Ramamurti, Representative\nShalala, and Senator Toomey – thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the\noperationalization of the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program, a facility authorized\nby the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”) under section\n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. As you know,\nthe Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) has committed to make an equity investment of $75\nbillion in the Program – and the funds available for investment by the Treasury were\nappropriated to the Exchange Stabilization Fund under section 4027 of the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”).\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which I lead, administers the operations of the\nMain Street Lending Program (“Main Street” or “Program”) for the Federal Reserve System. As\nsuch, I am very pleased to be here today to provide information that I hope will be useful to you\nin your important oversight work.\n\nBackground to the Program\nIn addition to the tragic loss of life, all of us know that the COVID-19 pandemic poses a\nshock to the U.S. economy that is unprecedented in our lifetimes. With real GDP in the second\nquarter falling by more than 30 percent, it is clear that businesses, nonprofits, and individuals\nacross the country are being challenged by the fallout from the virus. We have seen a\n\n1\n\n\fdisproportionate impact on entities whose operating models require significant social interaction,\nstemming from consumers’ concern with their own health and safety as well as more formal\nrestrictions on movement and commerce. For example, hotels, airlines, retail stores,\nentertainment venues, restaurants, and tourism-related enterprises have all suffered significant\ndisruptions to their businesses and cash flow, with more difficulties possible if the public health\nconcerns persist. Nonprofit entities like medical service providers and educational institutions\nalso are challenged.\nBoth fiscal and monetary policymakers have acted swiftly to address the economic\nimpacts of the pandemic and cushion the blow. The Federal Reserve, for example, has taken a\nnumber of aggressive policy actions since late winter, aimed at blunting the economic effects of\nthe crisis. Seeing unusual volatility and troubled financial markets, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee reduced short-term interest rates to near zero and purchased significant amounts of\nsecurities, and the Board of Governors established a variety of emergency facilities under section\n13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in order to restore market functioning and facilitate lending.\nThese actions helped to restore financial stability and significantly reduced spreads on\nshort- and long-term corporate and municipal securities – spreads which had increased due to\nuncertainty, and challenged the flows of credit that underpin our economy. And the facilities\nhelped to unlock a great deal of private credit, as well.\nMany of the emergency lending facilities are similar to facilities rolled out during the\n2008-2009 financial crisis. However, many of the businesses most impacted by the pandemic\nare smaller firms that rely on banks for loans, rather than accessing public credit markets (i.e.,\nissuing bonds). The Main Street Lending Program is designed to facilitate lending to small and\nmedium-sized businesses that have suffered disruptions from the pandemic, and were in sound\n\n2\n\n\fcondition prior to the pandemic. The program, like all emergency lending facilities, was\nauthorized by the Board and Treasury, and in this case is being implemented and administered by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nThe terms of the Main Street Program were enhanced and expanded by the Board and\nTreasury prior to the Program’s opening, and more recently a term sheet has been released that\nmakes the Program available to non-profit organizations as well as for-profit businesses. I would\nnote that in addition to providing loans for borrowers in current need of funds, the Program\noffers a credit backstop for firms that do not currently need financing, but may if the pandemic\ncontinues to erode the financial condition of these firms over late summer and fall.\nImportantly, the Main Street Lending Program differs from other programs for businesses\nmade possible by the CARES Act, reflecting the parameters of what the Federal Reserve is\nauthorized by Congress to do. Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, where many loans\ncould turn into grants funded by the CARES Act, the Main Street program involves loans that\nmust be repaid. The Program has no loan guarantee like the Small Business Administration\nprovided for the Paycheck Protection Program, and requires both the borrower and lender to be\neligible to participate in the Program.\nWe engaged in a great deal of consultation with potential borrowers and lenders as we set\nup the Program. In addition to soliciting public comment, staff at the Board of Governors,\nTreasury, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston conducted outreach to potential borrowers\nand lenders of all sizes – ranging from community banks to the largest lenders in the country – in\nan effort to gather information to inform policy judgments and operational decisions related to\nthe Program. In addition to the variety of outreach calls, we have hosted a series of 14 (so far)\nwebinars that have been tailored to borrowers and lenders, and in which presenters review the\n\n3\n\n\fterms, conditions, and operational details of the Program. All of the sessions have been well\nattended with many having more than 1,500 participants.\nTo ensure the Program is widely known, in conducting these webinars and otherwise\nsharing information we have made an intentional effort to reach nonprofits, minority and\nwomen-owned businesses, minority depository institutions, and tribal businesses. In addition,\nrobust Frequently Asked Questions documents provide detail on many aspects of the for-profit\nand non-profit program facilities, and are updated with some frequency.\n\nParameters of the Program\nThe Main Street Lending Program was designed to provide credit support for business or\nnonprofit borrowers that have temporary cash-flow problems due to the pandemic – and given\nthe uncertain outlook might otherwise have difficulty in obtaining credit from a lender that\nwould have to hold 100 percent of the loan. Main Street can provide a loan to bridge the\nborrower over this current challenge. Main Street loans have no interest or principal payments in\nthe first year, and indeed no principal payments until year three, making the cash-flow aspects of\nthe loan attractive to borrowers experiencing a pandemic-related, temporary disruption of their\nbusiness model.\nThe Program includes three lending components for for-profit businesses. They have\nsimilar interest rates, maturities, and terms, but have somewhat different collateral arrangements,\nloan-size limitations, and underwriting. For mid-sized businesses with existing term or revolving\nlines of credit, the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility (MSELF) allows businesses to upsize\ntheir current loans, with additional lending of $10 million to $300 million. For smaller\nbusinesses, the Main Street Priority Loan Facility (MSPLF) allows businesses to borrow from\n\n4\n\n\f$250,000 to $50 million. Under each of these facilities the Main Street loans must be senior or\npari passu (of equivalent status) with the borrower’s other loans and debt instruments (excluding\nmortgage debt).\nFor smaller business loans without collateral, there is the Main Street New Loan Facility\n(MSNLF) that provides loans from $250,000 to $35 million dollars, which cannot be\ncontractually subordinated to other debt. Because these loans do not have security or collateral\nrequirements, they are only available for firms whose debt including the Main Street loan does\nnot exceed four times the borrower’s EBITDA – a more restrictive underwriting criterion than\nthe other two loan types, which set maximum loan size based on six times the borrower’s\nEBITDA.\nThe two nonprofit lending components of Main Street are announced but not yet live.\nThey will have broadly similar terms as the for-profit Main Street facilities, for example in\nmaturity and interest rate. The Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility (NOELF) and\nthe Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility (NONLF) have similar priority and size\nrequirements to their for-profit counterparts. They differ in that the underwriting is tailored to\nthe special characteristics of nonprofits.\n\nLending, and Lenders\nWe have taken great care to operationalize the Main Street program to ensure it functions\nsmoothly and securely. Of course, setting up a program to serve many different borrowers and\nlenders is inherently complex, but I believe the Commission in its oversight role can feel\nconfident that this challenge is being met in strong fashion, in the public interest.\n\n5\n\n\fUnlike the corporate credit and muni facilities, which purchase largely standardized\ncredit instruments, Main Street purchases interests in loans that are, by nature, bespoke\nagreements between borrowers and lenders. Loan agreements and loan terms can be quite\ndifferent across banks, and even within a bank the agreements are the result of negotiation\nbetween borrower and lender that often result in complex, borrower-specific terms and\nconditions. For example, banks differ on whether they require personal guarantees or collateral\nin excess of Program requirements; and those policies may vary based on the financial condition\nor business model of the borrower.\nConstructing a Program that handles this complexity is something we have been intensely\nengaged with these last few months at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. We are pleased to\nhave the opportunity to do this important work, in the spirit of public service that runs through\nour work and our staff.\nShifting to how the program works, to become an eligible lender for the Program the\nfinancial institution must first register via our Main Street lender portal. As part of the\nenrollment process, the institution must verify that it meets our eligibility requirements, and\nmake attestations regarding CARES Act provisions which require the signature of the principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer. Furthermore, the institution must set up and\nverify arrangements to transfer funds effectively and safely, to ensure security and resilience.\nSince our portal opened for lender registration on June 15, 509 financial institutions have\nregistered with the Program, and their assets represent $14.25 trillion, which is approximately 58\npercent of total banking assets in the United States. The attached Figure 1 shows the size\ndistribution of registered MSLP lenders. It includes the largest universal banks and regional\n\n6\n\n\fbanks, and a sizable number of banks in the $1-10 billion asset range as well as in the under $1\nbillion asset category. Participation is of course strictly voluntary for financial institutions.\nDuring the extensive outreach that we did prior to launching Main Street, we heard\nconcerns from some businesses that their current lender would not be participating in the\nProgram or that they might find it difficult to locate a participating financial institution that\nwould work with new customers. In aiming to address these concerns, we ask lenders during the\nregistration process if they plan to accept loan applications from new customers. We contact\neach lender that says they would consider loan applications from new customers, and ask\nwhether they will join a public list of such lenders. Figure 2 shows the interactive map we\ncreated that allows borrowers to identify which lenders in their state are registered with Main\nStreet, are prepared to consider new customers, and are willing to be listed as such. The\ninteractive map is available on the program website, www.bostonfed.org/mslp, and we update\nthe list daily as new lenders register. Currently it contains 153 lenders. Figure 2 shows, for an\nexample, the financial institutions on the map for my home state of Massachusetts.\nIt is important to note that Main Street relies on lenders to underwrite the loans, and\nindeed the lenders have “skin in the game” by retaining 5 percent of the loan participation.\nBorrowers need to meet the underwriting standards of the financial institution, and the terms and\nconditions of the Main Street Lending Program, whether they have an existing relationship with\nthe lender or are a new customer.\nBorrowers also must meet the eligibility criteria set out in the Program term sheet, and\nmust be able to make the certifications and commitments required by the Program, including\nthose required under the CARES Act. Also, while the loan interest rate of 300 basis points over\nLIBOR is likely attractive to somewhat higher-risk borrowers, those businesses that have strong\n\n7\n\n\fbalance sheets and have not been significantly impacted by the pandemic may very well find\ntheir lender can give them more attractive terms than the Main Street Program. Because the\nloans are not forgivable by the Federal Reserve and lenders retain a 5 percent interest in the loan,\nborrowers must have the ability to pay back the loan. For borrowers with severe problems,\nadditional debt may not be helpful, and neither the lender nor the borrower will find taking\nadditional debt attractive. But for many others, the program can serve as a vital bridge to address\ncash flow interruption ushered in by the pandemic.\n\nEarly Results\nFigure 3 shows the flow of potential loan participation purchases through the Program’s\nportal as of the end of the day on Tuesday (August 4). As you see on the summary bottom line,\ncurrently over $530 million in loans are active in the portal, representing 54 loans. Of that total,\n18 loans with a combined value of $109 million have commitments for purchase or have been\nsettled. In addition, over $421 million in loans are in various stages of review in the portal. As a\nreminder, the program opened for loan purchases on July 6. The numbers I share with you today\nare consistent with what I would characterize as a gradual pace of initial activity, which is more\nrecently expanding.\nThe 54 loans submitted in the portal currently represent 29 distinct lenders. Almost all\nthe loans currently in the portal have been initiated by financial institutions with under $50\nbillion in assets. Additionally, there are 36 lenders with draft entries in progress in the system. I\nmention these draft entries because they reinforce that additional lenders are active in the portal\nand getting familiar with Program operations.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 4 breaks out the total of potential loans in the portal by the particular branch or\nfacility of the Program. The largest number of loans – 29 – are in the New Loan Facility.\nThe Priority Loan Facility currently has 24 loans valued at $328 million in the portal. And\ncurrently there is only one loan utilizing the Expanded Loan Facility in the portal. The\nExpanded loan facility will generally encompass larger loans and require current participating\nbanks to alter existing loan agreements to upsize existing credit facilities.\nFigure 5 provides the size distribution of potential loans currently in the portal. While\nthe largest number of loans are in the size cohort between $1 million and $2.5 million dollars,\nthere are loans under $1 million and greater than $30 million. The industries represented include\nconstruction and design firms, dental offices, retailers, and entertainment-related firms like\nmovie theaters. Thus, the loans we have seen to date have reflected what one might broadly\nexpect of small and mid-sized firms whose businesses have been disrupted by the current efforts\nat social distancing.\nFigure 6 shows the potential loan distribution by the asset size of the lender registered in\nthe Program. The largest number of loans are by financial institutions in the $10-50 billion size\nrange. However, there has been participation by relatively small community banks as well. To\ndate, there has been only limited activity by banks with more than $50 billion in assets.\nAs I alluded to a moment ago, the Program’s relatively modest initial numbers seem to be\ngiving way to more uptake as participants become familiar with the program’s parameters. I\nbelieve the gradual uptake is a function of participants adjusting to a few unavoidable factors.\nFirst and foremost, loans are bespoke, and the Program needs to accommodate lending across a\nwide range of industries, jurisdictions, and business profiles, which makes for operational\nchallenges. Also, the Program’s complexity reflects the underlying loan agreements, the terms\n\n9\n\n\fand conditions in the Program, and requirements related to the CARES Act. As a result, it can\ntake some time for borrowers and lenders to gather the required documents for submission to the\nProgram. Loan documents not in compliance with terms and conditions have slowed some of the\nintake. We are working to help participants understand and avoid common errors that can slow\nthe process down.\n\nSummary Observations\nDesigning and operationalizing a program of this breadth and nuance, delivered through\nhighly secure technology, is a significant achievement in a few months’ time. Everyone\ninvolved is focused on helping to provide important credit support to businesses and nonprofits\nat this critical and challenging time.\nAs we speak today, in early August, I can say that we have worked through many\nchallenges. Among the emergency lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve since\nlate winter – and indeed in comparison to the emergency programs of the 2008 financial crisis –\nthe Main Street Lending Program is operationally complex. Quickly scaling up a program that\npurchases participations in bespoke loans – from a very diverse group of borrowers in a\ndecentralized market that lacks standardization – is inherently difficult. There are also tradeoffs\nbetween limiting credit risk, targeting support, reaching scale, and achieving operational\nefficiency. Considerations such as these have made the Main Street Lending Program one of the\nmost challenging emergency lending programs the Federal Reserve has ever put in place. The\nCommission can be assured that the Federal Reserve and Treasury have sought to design a\nprogram that is well managed with respect to risks, efficiency, and resilience, while being\nresponsive to the needs of borrowers experiencing difficult times.\n\n10\n\n\fThe eventual size of the Program will be determined by the path of the pandemic and the\neconomy, generally. Should the pandemic and the economy worsen, or financial institutions\nexperience larger than expected loan losses and depletion of capital – all things we hope do not\nhappen – then I would expect interest in using this Program to expand more rapidly.\nIn conclusion, the pandemic’s shock to our economy is unprecedented, and the pain for\nbusinesses, organizations, and workers has been unparalleled in our lifetimes. It is important that\nthe Federal Reserve stands ready at this time of distress, in the public interest and in pursuit of\nour Congressional mandates, to support lending to for-profit businesses and nonprofit\norganizations of many sizes at reasonable rates. From many decades of research and\npolicymaking, I can attest that credit interruptions prolong recessions and ultimately harm\nindividuals on Main Streets across America. I pledge to you that in administering the Program,\nthe Boston Fed and the Federal Reserve as a whole will do all that is in our power and purview to\neffectively support the firms, nonprofits, and individuals that make up our nation’s economy.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide this high-level overview of the Program. I\nwould now be happy to address any questions.\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nJune 19, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the opportunity to address the Greater Providence\nChamber. I look forward to the time when these events can once again occur in person.\nFor all of us, the effects of COVID-19 have been uniquely challenging. Cities like\nBoston and New York ended up with a high number of COVID-19 cases, given their population\ndensity along with their mix of transportation, tourism, international business travel, and\neducation. Rhode Island, too, is one of several northeast states that has faced significant\nchallenges from the virus. Fortunately, many of the states in our area are following a datafocused strategy for relaxing quarantine arrangements. This conservative approach to reopening\nis likely to pay dividends for the health of vulnerable populations and for the medium- and\nlonger-term health of the economy.\nToday I would like to speak with you about the pandemic, its effects on the economy, the\nimplications for Federal Reserve policymaking, and some of the steps that the Fed is taking to\naddress the crisis and mitigate its financial impact on American households and businesses. This\nincludes the establishment of the Main Street Lending Program, which is being administered by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for the Federal Reserve System. I’ll say more about the\nprogram in a few moments, but let me note up front how pleased I am that the program opened\nfor lender registrations on Monday. Building the program and its operational background has\nbeen a complicated undertaking. I am confident that this innovative program can help lenders\nacross the country support the credit needs of local businesses during these very challenging\neconomic times, with the Fed standing ready to purchase 95 percent of eligible program loans –\nloans with terms to bridge businesses to better days, like a 5-year term and no principal payments\nfor the first two years.\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe program is needed because of the unique economic and public health emergency we\nall face. Restrictions on movement and commerce that were enacted in late winter to combat the\nvirus came with great economic costs, but were necessary to avoid much worse health outcomes\ndue, in part, to an overwhelmed healthcare system. These restrictions also allowed the time\nneeded to implement safety protocols throughout society.\nWith states beginning to relax mandated restrictions—some earlier than others—we are\nseeing more individuals returning to work. Indeed, the employment report for May was more\npositive than expected. 1 Any improvement in employment is wonderful news, given the\nimmense impact on individuals and households from job losses and unemployment.\nHowever, we currently face an unusually complex employment situation, given the\nongoing public health concerns. More people returning to work is good news in the longer run\nonly if it can be done safely and on a sustained basis. If workplaces reopen without the\nnecessary health precautions, the recent increases in payroll employment could be offset by\npossible business closures and serious health outcomes later. The prospect of such an outcome\ncould also sap investor, consumer, and firm confidence. If reopening can be done in ways that\nprotect public health, then better outcomes now will also translate to better outcomes in the\nfuture.\nEven as many individuals are able to return to work, we must be mindful of the deep pain\nstill occurring in many segments of the economy. Jobs related to personal services – such as\nrestaurants, hotels, retail stores, and tourism – have been disproportionately impacted by the\nhealth crisis. These sectors employ large numbers of workers, many of whom have little savings\nto cushion against a disruption in wages that lasts for many months. Frequently, these workers\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nare people of color, young workers, and workers with less educational attainment, and not\nsurprisingly, the unemployment rate has risen the most for these groups. In addition, many of\nthese workers are employed in small businesses, which are heavily represented in these service\nindustries and typically have very limited financial cushions to carry them through a disruption.\nSimply put, business models have been disrupted and some business owners have had their life’s\nwork endangered.\nFortunately, policymakers have acted quickly. The federal government has expanded its\nusual programs to help individuals during a downturn, such as making unemployment benefits\nmore available and paying higher benefits, as well as providing direct payments to lower-income\nindividuals.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of unprecedented actions to prevent\nbouts of financial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers\nand businesses. Among these actions, the Fed has reduced short-term interest rates to essentially\nzero in order to lower household and firms’ borrowing costs. The Fed has also stabilized\nfinancial markets with purchases of both Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, which lowers\ncosts for businesses to borrow and individuals to buy or refinance mortgages. Lastly, the Fed has\nalso initiated a range of emergency lending facilities to provide liquidity directly to borrowers\nand investors in key credit markets.\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss the progress of our Main Street Lending Program,\nwhich is designed to help credit flow to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound\nfinancial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, but now need loans to help maintain\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntheir operations and payroll until they have recovered from, or adapted to, the impacts of the\npandemic. 2\nDespite these important policy actions to date, I believe more support is likely to be\nneeded from both monetary and fiscal policy. Unemployment remains very high, and because of\nthe continued community spread of the disease, and the acceleration of new cases in many states,\nI expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the\noutset of the pandemic. My own forecast is that the unemployment rate will remain in double\ndigits through the end of the year, which is somewhat higher than the median view of\nparticipants at the Federal Reserve policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\nFOMC. At the same time, the inflation rate is very likely to remain well below the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target. With low inflation and high unemployment through this year and\nnext, I believe additional policy stimulus is necessary.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe employment report for May was stronger than most forecasters expected. One\npossible reason is that states began opening up earlier than epidemiologists were recommending\nand workers returned to their previous jobs or found new jobs faster than anticipated. 3 Still, even\nwith the employment gains, the unemployment rate remains quite elevated, as shown in Figure\n1. At 13.3 percent, the U.S. unemployment rate for May was up dramatically from February.\nHowever, even this very high unemployment rate understates the disruption in labor\nmarkets. The second set of bars shows the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ estimate of how\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmany respondents to the employment survey classified themselves as being employed but not at\nwork—individuals who should have been counted as unemployed on temporary layoff. As you\ncan see from the estimates, these respondents, if correctly classified, would have increased the\nunemployment rate by almost five percentage points in April and just over three percentage\npoints in May. So yes, the unemployment rate did improve from April, but the picture is not as\nbright as the headline unemployment rate measure suggests. In addition, the number of\nindividuals wanting a job now but not currently looking for work, the third set of bars, also rose\nonce the pandemic hit. Taken together, these three sets of bars indicate a badly disrupted labor\nmarket.\nFigure 2 shows that the unemployment rate rose for all age cohorts. However,\nindividuals between the ages of 16 to 24 have a particularly elevated unemployment rate. This\nindicates the presence of significant challenges for those individuals who are newly entering the\nlabor market and are frequently looking for entry-level positions. This should be particularly\nconcerning, given prior evidence that the earnings paths of those individuals entering the labor\nmarket during a downturn are adversely affected for many years.\nFigure 3 illustrates that Hispanic and African American workers have been\ndisproportionately impacted by recent job losses, with Hispanic workers showing the largest\nincrease in unemployment. In all, while prior to the pandemic unemployment for people of color\nhad fallen to quite low levels by historical standards, these groups have been disproportionately\nimpacted since the onset of COVID-19.\nFigure 4 shows that the pandemic caused increases in unemployment across all\neducational attainment categories. However, the increase in unemployment is particularly\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npronounced for those with lower levels of educational attainment. Many of the jobs that are\noften filled by people with lower educational attainment are service jobs that have been\nparticularly impacted by the pandemic, such as positions at hotels, restaurants, and tourismrelated firms.\nFigure 5 provides the median forecast for several economic variables submitted by\nparticipants at the June FOMC meeting. These median forecasts reflect the significant economic\ntoll from the pandemic. Real GDP is forecast to decline by 6.5 percent this year, core inflation is\nexpected to end the year at only 1 percent, and the unemployment rate is forecast to be 9.3\npercent by year end. Unfortunately, I believe even this dire outlook may be too optimistic. My\nown forecast is somewhat more pessimistic, as I expect the unemployment rate to still be at\ndouble-digit levels at the end of the year, given what are likely to be persistent economic\nheadwinds from the pandemic over the second half of the year. And my own more pessimistic\nforecast does not fully incorporate the challenges of a second wave of the virus that is more\nsevere than the first – an outcome that occurred with the 1918 Spanish Flu, the 1957-1958 Asian\nFlu, and the 2009-2010 H1N1 Flu.\nAs Figure 6 highlights, the economic toll of the virus is closely tied to how successfully\nwe can get the public health pandemic under control. So far, in the United States efforts to\ncontain the virus have not been particularly successful, with more cases per thousand than the\nother countries shown on the chart. This lack of containment could ultimately lead to a need for\nmore prolonged shut-downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher\nunemployment – as shown on the chart. Countries with much more successful pandemic\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncontainment efforts, like Japan and South Korea, have also had much less disruption to their\nlabor markets.\nAs a result, I believe that a more rapid and complete economic recovery requires better\nability to contain the pandemic. Or medical solutions that make infections much less likely, such\nas with an introduction of a successful vaccine – or much less severe, such as with the\ndevelopment of more effective treatments.\nFigure 7 shows differences in social distancing across states, measured in terms of\nmobility from cell phone-based foot traffic data to over 5 million points of interest. The figure\nsuggests that social distancing behavior is strikingly different across states. In Massachusetts\nand Rhode Island, where the economy is now only slowly reopening, non-essential retail and\nrestaurant visits are down dramatically and do not look much different now than in the middle of\nMarch. In contrast, a state like South Carolina, and to some degree Florida, have seen visits to\nnon-essential retail establishments and restaurants rise following their initial decline in March,\nand especially since the early reopening of these states’ economies. Especially in South\nCarolina, visits to these locations are only a little lower now relative to their pre-shutdown levels.\nRapidly available (higher frequency) expenditure data show a pattern similar to the mobility\nnumbers – with spending in many southern states that reopened earlier rebounding more than in\nstates in the Northeast and West.\nWhether states with mobility patterns like Massachusetts and Rhode Island – or South\nCarolina and Florida – fare better going forward will depend importantly on how changes in\nsocial distancing affect the progress of the pandemic; in fact, evidence is already emerging that\nnew cases in South Carolina and Florida are rising (Figure 8). If there are significant flare-ups\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nin states that have aggressively reopened, the reduction in social distancing that contributes to\nstronger economic performance in such states now may translate to more depressed economic\nactivity and increased public health issues in those states in the future. And given the U.S.\npopulation’s ability to travel, any region that does not socially distance effectively and suffers\nincreased rates of infection will likely export their public health problems to other regions of the\ncountry that are tourist sites, transportation hubs, or educational centers.\nIn sum, given the death toll of the virus even with the economic lockdown, I see a\nsubstantial risk in reopening too fast and relaxing social distancing too much. And even if it\nturns out that the response to the pandemic has been calibrated appropriately, the forecast from\nFOMC participants highlights the need for additional highly stimulative monetary policy,\nincluding the use of Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities.\n\nUpdate on the Main Street Lending Program\nI will now turn to a discussion of the Main Street Lending Program, expanding on some\nof my earlier comments. Since the Federal Reserve first announced the program, 4 the Boston\nFed has been very focused on taking all the necessary steps to operationalize this innovative\nemergency lending initiative, which aims to help facilitate credit flows that can bridge small and\nmedium-sized businesses until better economic times. I’m very happy to provide an update on\nthose efforts today, and would like to say a bit about the ways this program can make a\ndifference.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFirst, some context. In contrast to many of the Federal Reserve’s emergency facilities,\nwhich focus on buying relatively standardized market securities, the Main Street Lending\nProgram focuses on bank loans to businesses. Since every business, and every business loan, is\nsomewhat unique, the program is inherently complex. I am very proud of the team that is\nworking tirelessly to stand up the program to serve the public interest at this terribly challenging\ntime in our economy.\nIn particular, the program addresses a problem that is evident in Figure 9. In each of the\npast three recessions, business lending decreased significantly. While some of these declines\nresulted from reduced demand for loans from businesses, in two of the past three recessions\nlending conditions clearly tightened significantly, restricting credit supply. In general, credit\nsupply is restricted when uncertainty is high and some banks experience elevated loan losses.\nThis dynamic is particularly relevant if bankers fear worsening economic conditions, or\ntheir bank’s own financial condition makes them more reluctant to lend on the same terms as\nprior to the economic downturn. In severe downturns, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis,\npoorly capitalized banks reduced their balance sheets by becoming much more restrictive with\ntheir lending. (Loans are assets for banks, so lending less preserves capital-to-assets ratios when\ncapital is under stress). While banks are currently well capitalized, the economic outlook is\nhighly uncertain, with substantial downside risks, and bank balance sheets may become more\npressured over time. While some previous recessions have involved credit crunches, the kind of\nshock we’ve seen since the pandemic arrived is unprecedented in post-war history.\nTo facilitate the flow of credit for businesses, particularly those that are dependent on\nbank financing, the Federal Reserve created the Main Street Lending Program to participate in\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlending with banks. While I covered some of the details of this program in an earlier talk, recent\nchanges to the program made it even more widely available for borrowers, allowing more small\nand medium-sized businesses to be able to receive loans. 5 The revised term sheet included\nsignificant adjustments. I would highlight that the minimum loan size was reduced to $250,000,\nmaking it more attractive to smaller businesses and community banks. In addition, the terms\nwere made more attractive. The maturity was extended to five years (from four), and the\namortization schedule was eased. No principal is due in the first two years, with interest deferred\nin the first year.\nThe program is designed to assist lenders in meeting the credit needs of the businesses in\ntheir communities, even amidst the pandemic’s economic disruptions. The Fed will participate in\nthe lending by purchasing a 95 percent interest in the loan, provided it meets the terms and\nconditions of the program. By purchasing this percentage of the loans, the Federal Reserve will\ntake on most of the risk that would otherwise need to be absorbed solely by lenders, and will\ncreate additional balance sheet capacity for lenders to extend more loans at this challenging time\nfor our country’s economy.\nInterested businesses will work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the\nprogram requirements, which are available online, as well as the lender’s own underwriting\nstandards. The lender will determine whether a business is approved for a loan. 6\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve just announced it is seeking feedback on a proposal to\nexpand the program to support nonprofit entities. 7 While the loan underwriting conditions have\nbeen tailored to nonprofits, other aspects of the loan, such as maturity and amortization are the\nsame as for small and medium-sized businesses (Figure 10). The Federal Reserve and Treasury\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nare seeking comment on this term sheet before revising it and preparing to operationalize the\nprogram.\nOn Monday of this week, we opened the registration and verification process for financial\ninstitutions that wish to participate as lenders in the Main Street Program. These are still early\ndays in the program, and we are seeing a steady stream of interest – with over 200 financial\ninstitutions, large and small, initiating registration as of yesterday. The institutions that have\nregistered so far are geographically dispersed, representative of all 12 Federal Reserve districts.\nI am encouraged, too, by the interest of many smaller financial institutions like community\nbanks.\nMany more lenders have inquired about the program and attended our outreach sessions.\nWe encourage lenders who have not yet registered to explore the program, learn about the ways\nit can help them help their business borrowers, register to participate, and in fact to begin to\nimmediately make the loans that qualify using the program terms. Lenders need not wait to\nmake qualified loans, which they will be able to sell 95 percent of to the Fed when the program’s\ntransactional phase begins. 8\nI anticipate that many more institutions will register for the program, given its benefits to\nthem, their customers, and the areas where they operate. We continue to do widespread outreach\nand field significant numbers of inquiries. Lenders have a vested interest in the resilience of the\nbusinesses in their market, and this program gives them a way to help bridge those businesses\nthat were sound before the pandemic to better days.\nOf course there is a learning curve, but we are seeing tremendous interest in the loans\nfrom businesses. Lenders are determining how they’ll participate in and communicate about the\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nprogram. Borrowers will need to persist during this ramp-up phase. But I am very positive\nabout the promise of the program in helping local businesses and lenders maintain vital business\ncredit during these very challenging economic times.\n\nConcluding Observations\nI’d like to conclude with a few big-picture comments. The global pandemic has already\nmade existing societal divisions starker – and recent tragic events have left us all wresting with\nthe complex reality of societal inequities. Here at the Boston Fed, we know that now, more than\never, it is important to continue our work to make socio-economic outcomes inclusive of every\nAmerican. The recovery after the Great Recession, with low levels of unemployment enjoyed\nacross disparate demographic groups before the COVID-19 outbreak, illustrates that the Federal\nReserve’s fulfillment of the full employment mandate can help to support an inclusive economy.\nThe U.S. economy is currently suffering from high unemployment and low inflation,\nfully justifying additional monetary and fiscal policy actions to return the economy as quickly as\npossible to where we were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While these policies can help\nmitigate the economic impact of the crisis, much of the path of the economy will be determined\nby the virus and how successfully it can be contained, either through public health or medical\ninnovations.\nAs well as more traditional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve is operating\nseveral significant emergency credit facilities. The Main Street Lending Program has recently\nexpanded in scope to become more attractive for borrowers and lenders. Our hope is that this\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, June 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nprogram will, over time, provide an important source of liquidity for small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that might otherwise not receive credit on the same terms. In addition, it provides an\nimportant backstop should the pandemic be more severe than anticipated this fall.\nThank you, and I wish you all continued health during these challenging times.\n\n1\n\nSee May 8, 2020 Employment Situation Summary by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nFor more discussion of the Main Street Lending Program, see my remarks delivered to the New England Council\non May 19, 2020: https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2020/main-street-lending-program-andother-federal-reserve-actions.aspx.\n2\n\nForecasters likely knew states were reopening sooner than anticipated when writing down their employment\noutlooks so it is more workers finding jobs faster than they were anticipating given the reopening or the broader\ndisconnect between the claims data and household survey data.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\n\n5\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200608a.htm\n\nThe Main Street program aims to assist businesses that employ a major share of the American workforce.

The Main Street Lending\nProgram will also accept loans that were originated under the previously announced terms, if funded before June 10,\n2020.\n8\n\n13\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the New England Council\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 19, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to offer some remarks and information\nduring this incredibly challenging time for New Englanders and all Americans. People in\nhouseholds across the country are coping with illness, working on front lines, and adjusting to\nnew realities and uncertainties. Most Americans are concerned about the impact of the public\nhealth crisis on their family and friends; and worry about their financial health too, given the\nsevere economic consequences of the pandemic.\nUnfortunately, the pandemic and the absolutely necessary response, aimed at protecting\nlives and health, involve a high cost to the economy – which was so recently doing very well.\nThe economic shock is an unprecedented challenge for economic policymakers including the\nFederal Reserve, where we will do whatever we can to support a return to full employment and\nstable prices – our mandate from Congress – and our commitment to financial stability, which is\nimportant to the well-being of all Americans.\nPublic health concerns are driving the economic challenges we face, so as an economic\npolicymaker I have to analyze a range of medical and public health issues. Unfortunately, in the\nUnited States we have so far not been able to fully halt community spread of the virus, and many\nstates are now relaxing restrictions even while infections and deaths remain a major concern.\nWhile allowing employers to reopen will enable some people to return to work, it is not a\npanacea for our economic challenges, which again are rooted in public health concerns. It is\npossible that many households will remain reluctant to spend, and employees may be reluctant to\nreturn to the workplace – either because of their own health concerns, the lack of open daycare\nfacilities or schools for their children, or to protect or take care of other family members. Some\nfirms may be reluctant to invest, until community spread of the virus has been significantly\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreduced. The optimal mix of public health and economic policies is complex, making economic\nforecasts at this juncture unusually uncertain.\nTo be sure, the economic pain ushered in by the pandemic is extraordinary. The recent\nemployment report1 underscores the unprecedented speed and ferocity with which jobs have\nbeen affected by this public health crisis. Social distancing and quarantine are essential health\npolicy measures, but costly. It is important that the sacrifices and progress made so far not be\nundone. This requires that health policy measures limit the risk of second waves of the\npandemic, to the extent possible.\nFrom an economic policy standpoint, my view is that measures should be taken to limit\nthe potential for medium- and longer-term “scarring” from the crisis. This means, among other\nthings, minimizing the length of unemployment spells, and ensuring that solvent firms have the\nliquidity necessary to weather the crisis. As a result, it is very important that we maintain\nresolve to do whatever is necessary to restore the public health and economic health of the\nUnited States as quickly as possible.\nCentral banks can play a powerful role in crises. Some of the more significant financial\nspillovers recently have been mitigated by the actions of the Federal Reserve.2 For example, the\npanic selling that hit financial markets in March was largely offset by the Fed – by reducing\nshort-term interest rates to near zero, and setting up emergency lending facilities and purchasing\nsecurities to support the credit needs of U.S. households and businesses. Preventing bouts of\nfinancial instability from having significant spillovers to the flow of credit to consumers and\nbusinesses is a vital crisis role for central banks, and the Fed has aggressively played that role\nduring this very challenging period.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn my remarks today, I will provide a brief overview of the economy and its future\nprospects. I will discuss two of the Federal Reserve System’s lending programs – which are\nbeing operated by the Boston Fed for the System – in an effort to help explain and illuminate\nrecent policy actions and to inform businesses and lending institutions about how they can\nparticipate.\nThe first emergency lending facility I will discuss is the Money Market Mutual Fund\nLending Facility,3 which was established in late March and operates out of the Boston Fed to\nhelp alleviate disruptions in short-term credit markets and money market mutual funds.\nThe second program I will discuss is the Main Street Lending Program, which, when it\nbegins operating in the coming weeks, is intended to help provide loans to businesses affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.4 The program will operate through three facilities: the New, Priority,\nand Expanded loan facilities. I will say more about the program in a moment.\n\nRecent Economic Developments\nI’d like to give an overview of recent economic developments. As I noted in my\nintroduction, the April employment report encapsulated the scale and severity of this publichealth-driven economic crisis. Job loss for so many Americans is spurring the Federal Reserve\nto do all we can to help, as I will describe shortly.\nWhile the economy had a very low unemployment rate in February – 3.5 percent – by\nApril the unemployment rate had soared to 14.7 percent, as shown in Figure 1. In addition,\npayroll employment declined by 20.5 million jobs in the month of April. This unprecedented\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshock to the labor markets has two components: employees who temporarily are not working\nbecause of the mandated shutdowns intended to contain the pandemic, and those workers\ncurrently, or likely to soon be, more permanently unemployed because firms are closing or\nbecause the weakened demand for goods does not require as many workers. Unlike the past\nthree recessions, the April data are consistent with most of these workers being temporarily laid\noff. Yet the following is a key point: how we all address the pandemic will greatly influence\nhow many of these temporary job losses become permanent.\nFigure 2 shows the percent decline in payroll jobs for select industries, with the decline\nmeasured from February, before the pandemic widely affected labor markets. The largest\ndeclines occurred in industries where social distancing is most challenging – such as recreation,\nentertainment, the arts, and food services. These activities have been severely curtailed by\nclosure requirements, and may continue to be hurt by the discomfort individuals may have in\nattending large events or eating out while community spread of the disease remains a concern.\nFigure 3 illustrates the declines in employment in terms of the total numbers of jobs lost\nby industry. The two largest drops were in accommodation and food services, and retail trade.\nThese two industries employ a large share of U.S. workers, and again are industries that may\nhave trouble returning to full capacity as long as consumers are concerned about their safety.\nFigure 4 shows the share of total employment for industries that may be significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic for some time. With accommodation and food services, and retail\ntrade, together accounting for such a large share of total employment (nearly 20%), a full\nrecovery in the economy is going to hinge on how well society gets the pandemic under control.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIf consumers are afraid to eat out, shop, or travel, a relaxation in laws requiring business closures\nmay do little to bring back customers, and thus jobs.\nFigure 5 provides another reason why firms may face significant challenges as long as\nthe public health concerns have not been sufficiently mitigated. Americans that are between 50\nand 79 years of age account for 45 to 55 percent of purchases in spending categories that are\nimportantly affected by social distancing. Because people in this age cohort are more likely to\nsuffer severe consequences if infected by the virus, they may be particularly reluctant to venture\nout until the public health situation improves significantly.\nIn sum, simply allowing businesses to reopen is not a panacea. Until community spread\nof the virus has been significantly reduced, many of the industries with the sharpest job cuts will\nlikely face reduced demand as long as social distancing is necessary. Public health solutions are\nparamount – without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment. It is vital\nthat the design and timing of reductions in business restrictions not result in worse health\noutcomes and higher unemployment over a longer period of time.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Response to the Pandemic\nIf they do the right things, central banks can help address crises and prevent, or at least\nsubstantially mitigate, the spillover of problems from the financial realm to the real economy\ncomposed of household and business activity. Although the unemployment rates may look\nsimilar to those in the Great Depression, both fiscal policy from the federal government and\nFederal Reserve actions have now – in contrast to the Great Depression era – taken\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunprecedented actions to mitigate the economic downturn. The Fed quickly reduced short-term\ninterest rates to close to zero; stabilized the foundational markets for Treasury and mortgage\nsecurities, through purchases; and established lending facilities to make sure that credit is\navailable and not seizing up. And Congress has passed and the President has signed several\naggressive spending and aid packages to assist laid-off workers and to support businesses during\nthe shutdown.\nToday, in the interest of time, I would like to focus on two of the emergency Federal\nReserve facilities, as they are being administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It is\nimportant to note that the powers granted to the Fed for emergency and exigent actions involve\nlending, not spending.5 All of the Fed’s programs involve loans that are to be repaid; they are\nnot grants by the Fed. But lending can play a crucial role in a crisis and in bridging to more\nnormal conditions.\nThe Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or MMLF, set up in March and\noperating through the Boston Fed, was designed to address two problems. First, short-term debt\ninstruments, such as commercial paper, were not trading efficiently due to a lack of liquidity, and\nthe interest-rate spreads had become unusually wide (meaning rates were jumping higher as asset\nprices fell in “fire sale” mode). Second, prime money market funds that buy these short-term\ndebt instruments were facing redemptions by investors, and at the same time were having\ndifficulty selling financial instruments that normally are highly liquid, with rates close to the\nfederal funds rate.\nMore specifically, money market funds that invest substantially in corporate short-term\ndebt, including commercial paper, experienced large redemptions as conditions deteriorated in\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMarch. The concern was that such large redemptions would reduce the supply of credit to\nbusinesses. Moreover, these large outflows risked further disrupting the short-term credit\nmarkets, including if money market mutual funds resorted to disposing of assets at “fire sale”\nprices, or imposed fees or gates on redeeming investors – which would mean further loss of\npublic confidence and impacts on households and businesses that invest in these funds.\nFigure 6 shows that in February, commercial paper was trading relatively close to the\nfederal funds rate. As the pandemic worsened, the federal funds rate was cut to nearly zero, but\neven so, rates on commercial paper rose significantly. In response to these developments, the\nMMLF was established to provide non-recourse loans, generally at an interest rate of 1.25\npercent, that were collateralized by short-term debt instruments owned by money market funds.\nAs the MMLF made loans, the rates began to fall on short-term debt instruments, and by the\nmiddle of April, short-term rates were well below the 1.25 percent charged on those loans,\nmeaning the market had stabilized and the emergency facility worked.\nFigure 7 shows another dimension of this brief crisis. While government money market\nfunds, which invest in securities with little default risk, were experiencing large inflows, by the\nmiddle of March as crisis conditions flared up, the riskier prime money market funds were\nexperiencing significant outflows. To meet these outflows, the prime funds were selling shortterm debt instruments amid an illiquid market for such assets. With the availability of the\nMMLF, the pressure on prime funds receded and investor confidence improved so that the\noutflows quickly slowed down – and since the middle of April both types of funds have been\ngenerally experiencing inflows.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 8 shows that assets under management of the government money market funds\nhave continued to rise, and are well above pre-pandemic levels. Prime funds have stabilized and\nare gradually seeing modest inflows, although they remain well below pre-pandemic levels.\nSince the middle of April, there has been little activity at the MMLF. This is by design: the\nfacility’s terms become less attractive as the crisis in a particular market fades and normal credit\nflows resume. The facility has advanced more than $50 billion in loans, which are already in the\nprocess of being paid off, with total loans outstanding now under $40 billion. Currently, both\nshort-term credit markets and money market funds are operating with more normal pricing and\ninterest-rate spreads. This is important, as these markets underpin the financing flows on which\nmany businesses depend.\n\nMain Street Lending Program\nThe other Federal Reserve program being administered by the Boston Fed is the Main\nStreet Lending Program. The MSLP is a loan program designed to help credit flow to small- and\nmedium-sized businesses that were in good financial condition prior to the crisis, but now need\nloans that can help them until they have recovered from, or adapted to, the impact of the\npandemic.\nIts structure is designed to reach those borrowers in a way that supports their operations\nand employment, supporting economic activity but also managing risk and safeguarding the\ntaxpayer backstop. There are various loan sizes to meet a range of needs of small and midsize\nborrowers, and attractive terms (for example, no payments or interest for a year, a 4-year term,\nand a moderate interest rate).\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nLet me begin by discussing some of the ways this program is unique, even among the\nFed’s other crisis actions, both now and in the past. By the way, some of these unique aspects\naccount for the time it is taking to set up the program. While many of the Fed’s facilities focus\non securities that are relatively homogenous financial instruments, this program seeks to support\nbank lending. Bank loans are not very standardized – for example, the terms and conditions of\nthe loan are negotiated between borrower and lender. Smaller companies likely also have less\npublic information available for making a credit risk evaluation.\nThe program differs from other programs for businesses made possible by the CARES\nAct. Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), where many loans could turn to grants\nfunded by the CARES Act, the Main Street Lending Program involves loans that must be repaid.\nThe MSLP has no loan guarantee like the Small Business Administration provided for the PPP,\nand requires both the borrower and lender to be eligible to participate in the program.6\nFigure 9 shows a stylized version of the Main Street program. As previously mentioned,\nthe program is designed to serve businesses that were doing well before the pandemic began, are\nexperiencing pandemic-related disruption, and are expecting to do well once the pandemic is\ncontained. The program is aimed at lending to mid-sized and small entities that are too big for\nthe PPP and too small for other emergency credit facilities.7 Enterprises of this sort accounted\nfor a major share of U.S employment, and this program intends to make loans that support their\nability to continue until the pandemic is contained and the recovery ensues.\nBusinesses will not come directly to the Federal Reserve for a loan. Instead, potential\nbusiness borrowers need to work with an eligible lender to determine if they meet the minimum\nrequirements for the program, as defined in the term sheets as well as the lender’s own\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunderwriting standards. An eligible lender will ultimately determine whether a borrower is\napproved for a loan, considering credit risk. Banks will underwrite the loan and the Federal\nReserve will participate with the bank in the lending by purchasing 85 or 95 percent of the loan,\ndepending on the program facility. Hence, the lenders continue to have “skin in the game” to\nensure that they will be motivated to certify the quality of the loan.\nSome of the high-level terms of the loans are shown in Figure 10. The new, priority,\nand expanded facilities’ loans all share some common characteristics. The maturity of the loans\nis four years, the loans have no interest or principal payments due in the first year, the loans can\nbe prepaid, and the loans have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3 percent.\nHowever, there are differences among the facilities, including with respect to how the\nloan types interact with the borrower’s existing outstanding debt. The new and priority lending\nfacilities, which are likely to serve somewhat smaller companies, provide new loans for which\nthe eligible lender seeks the participation of the Federal Reserve. Both facilities would be\navailable to the participating lender’s existing customers as well as new customers. The loan\nsize range is $500,000 to $25 million. The two facilities have different features to allow a\nbroader range of potential eligible borrowers. In the new facility, the MSNLF, the lender retains\na 5 percent stake, but the debt level of the borrower must remain low.8 In the priority facility,\nthe MSPLF, the borrowing business can carry somewhat more debt but the lender must take a\nlarger share of the loan – 15 percent – and the loan must not be junior to9 other debt (other than\nmortgage debt).10\nFor larger businesses, it is likely that they may already have a loan agreement with\nmultiple banks, with these loans being secured or unsecured. The Main Street program’s\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nexpanded loan facility (MSELF) provides an opportunity for eligible lenders to increase (or\n“upsize”) an existing term loan or revolving credit facility, with the Federal Reserve becoming a\nnew participant. This expanded loan facility for larger borrowers has a much higher minimum\nloan size, $10 million, and a maximum loan size of $200 million. The bank must maintain a 5\npercent stake in the expanded loan, with the Federal Reserve taking the remainder.\nAs shown in Figure 11, there are several ways the Federal Reserve will manage this\nprogram to address inherent risks. First, the lenders will need to underwrite the loan and retain\ntheir own stake in it, at 5 or 15 percent depending on the facility. Second, the borrower’s credit\nneeded to be in good standing prior to the pandemic – loans to these borrowers must have been\nrated “pass” at the end of 2019.11 Third, the borrower is limited in how levered the loan can be,\nas noted a moment ago. One implication is that firms that were already very highly levered\ngoing into the pandemic will not qualify for a loan from these facilities. Fourth, and more\nbroadly, the U.S. Treasury Department will make a $75 billion equity investment in the facilities\nto cover potential losses, using funds appropriated under the CARES Act.\nThis is only a high-level discussion of the program. Interested borrowers or lenders\nshould refer to the information we have posted on the web, for more program details. Additional\ndetails about the program will be forthcoming as we approach launch, including webinars\navailable to potential borrowers and to lenders.\nAlso, I would mention that while nonprofit organizations are not currently eligible under\nthe program, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the unique needs of nonprofit organizations,\nmany of which are on the front lines providing critical services and research to fight the\npandemic. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department will be evaluating the feasibility\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof adjusting the borrower eligibility criteria and loan eligibility metrics of the program for such\norganizations. Such an evaluation will also likely take place with respect to asset-based\nborrowers.\nThe maximum amount of loan participation agreements the Fed will purchase in the Main\nStreet program is $600 billion, with the U.S. Treasury providing $75 billion in equity to cover\npotential losses. Since these are loans with repayment expected (not forgivable loans or grants),\nwe are anticipating that the Treasury backstop will ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet\nall eligible loans. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is in the process of hiring several\ncompanies to help support this large and complex program. Information on these supporting\nfirms – selected in a competitive process focused on both capacity to perform and price – will be\nposted on the Boston Fed’s website in the coming weeks.\nThis is an important program, and we’ve worked very hard to get it right. We listened\ncarefully to initial feedback and expanded the program in a number of ways to serve a wider\nrange of borrowers. It will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an\nimportant bridge for many businesses that employ much of the American workforce. We will\nalso have the ability to adjust the program, if needed.\nAs Figure 12 shows, businesses and lenders interested in participating can find more\ninformation at www.bostonfed.org/mslp -- including frequently asked questions, term sheets, a\nmailbox for submitting questions, and a way to subscribe to future email notifications that will\ngo out when updates are available. I would also mention the webinars that we plan to host over\nthe coming weeks.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe economy has suffered a truly severe shock from the COVID-19 public health crisis.\nThe unemployment rate has risen very significantly in response to necessary shutdowns\nintending to limit the health impact of the pandemic. However, even when businesses are free to\nopen, many may face diminished demand until customers once again feel secure leaving their\nhomes, which underlines that public health is at the root of this crisis and its solutions.\nI expect that the unemployment rate will likely peak at close to 20 percent.\nUnfortunately, even by the end of the year, I expect the unemployment rate to remain at doubledigit levels. This outlook is both sobering and a call to action. Now is the time for both\nmonetary and fiscal policy to act boldly to minimize the economic pain from the pandemic.\nThe Federal Reserve has taken strong actions to mitigate the economic consequences of\nthis crisis. Policymakers have dropped interest rates to near zero, bought Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities, and initiated a range of lending facilities. I have provided some\ndetail on the Main Street Lending Program, one of the more innovative and economically\nimportant programs which we expect to open in the coming weeks.

            "content": "Addressing the Economic Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nA perspective from Eric Rosengren, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJust 20 days ago, Dr. Paul Biddinger and I urged employers to prepare for the gathering storm by taking tangible steps,\nlike implementing work-from-home and restricting business travel, to prevent more devastating health and economic\noutcomes from the pandemic.\nToday, we’re witnessing the pandemic’s stark effects on public health. Meanwhile, the necessary response – social\ndistancing – has stilled our strong economy, disrupting countless lives and livelihoods. It’s also been distorting the credit\nand liquidity flows that underpin our economy, threatening the greater pain of a full-blown financial crisis.\nBut everybody can help mitigate the pandemic’s impact. Public health officials and heroic front-line medical personnel\nplay the most important part. Governments, civic organizations, scientific and educational institutions, and citizens also\nhave key roles to play. And fiscal policy is crucial.\nAt the central bank we’re focused on addressing, and blunting, the economic effects of the pandemic. The Federal\nReserve has acted quickly to address spillovers from the economic disruption. I’d like to explain some of what the Fed\ndid, and suggest other steps that a range of parties could pursue.\nThe Federal Reserve is working to limit the financial and economic distress – to take actions that help avoid even higher\nlevels of unemployment or a slower recovery. To that end, the Fed’s interest-rate-setting committee cut the short-term\nrates the Fed controls to close to zero to help ease market interest rates in an economy suddenly facing challenges (see\nFig. 1).\nFurther, both the Treasury and mortgage-securities markets had too many people and institutions seeking to sell assets\nto raise cash (rushing to more liquid assets as a crisis response), resulting in an inability to trade, and unusual volatility.\nTo remedy distortions in these important markets, the Fed has been buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities\nto stabilize markets and make it easier for financial institutions to pass through lower interest rates to consumers and\nbusinesses.\nIn addition, many firms and individuals keep liquid assets in money market funds, and there was a danger of seeing\nfunds gated or closed as investors rushed to pull cash from them (see Fig. 2). Similarly, the municipal money market\nfunds that buy short-term, highly-rated municipal securities and help meet the short-term funding needs of\nmunicipalities were seeing few trades. In sum, given the rush for cash in financial markets, it was proving a challenge for\nthe funds to sell high-quality debt of even the strongest companies and states. The Boston Fed opened a facility that\nlends money to banks, so they can buy these highly-rated assets from money market funds. This ensures money market\nfunds can meet the demands of individuals and firms seeking to redeem cash, restores a market for short-term highquality assets, and addresses the liquidity problem impacting individuals, companies, and local governments.\nAlso, the New York Reserve Bank is running a facility to buy short-term high-quality assets of firms – helping trading to\nresume and supporting firms’ ability to issue short-term debt. It is important for economic functioning that firms have\naccess to funding. The New York Fed is establishing facilities for firms to issue debt and for secondary trading of debt.\n(see Figs. 3 & 4)\nMeanwhile, problems threatened to ripple through banking markets as business closures and layoffs spiked. To meet\nthe increased demand for liquidity, the Federal Reserve is providing collateralized loans to banks so their customers –\nfirms and individuals – have access to liquid funds. Regulatory changes will allow banks to restructure loans to help\n\n\findividuals and businesses with a temporary loss of revenue avoid bankruptcy and layoffs by, for instance, deferring\npayment of principal and interest for up to six months.\nFiscal policymakers have acted strongly with the recently passed CARES Act. We must continue to adapt as the crisis\nproceeds, with constant attention to the plight of workers who have been or will be laid off. Unfortunately, we expect\nthe unemployment rate to rise dramatically.\nSocial distancing is needed to avoid overwhelmed medical facilities and unnecessary deaths, but it also poses great\nchallenges for low-income workers, who are more likely to lose jobs and have few other resources. Meanwhile,\nfurloughs have been occurring, particularly in the hotel, retail, travel and restaurant industries. We’ve already seen an\nunprecedented rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance.\nTraditional economic models are challenged by this unique situation. To me, the most important factors are how well\nwe avoid financial spillovers, and how effective the fiscal stimulus is, as well as the progression of COVID-19 infections.\nThese will all impact the speed of the economic recovery. That is not a fatalistic assessment. On the contrary, it should\ngalvanize us. In that spirit, I offer three concluding observations:\n1. This is a time for public-spiritedness\nOur mantra at the Boston Fed is “public service that makes a difference.” Central banks can and must do a lot in crises,\nto alleviate stresses in the financial system we all count on, which can hurt all citizens. But everyone – in small or big\nways – can do their part to make a difference. The public interest is more important than ever; social distancing is one\nexample. What we all do now in the public interest can help recovery, once the worst is over.\n2. This is no time to leave anyone behind\nWe are all being challenged right now, but our legacy can be that we rose to the challenge and kept a focus on the\nvulnerable, those with low and moderate income, and those whose livelihoods operate on the thinnest of margins. The\nlong-term prosperity of our region and the people who are our neighbors (and our customers) will shape the recovery.\nAmong other things, we need to support the workers who keep our organizations and those we rely on (like grocery\nstores, shipping networks, and of course health care) up and running. And we must tide over workers and businesses\nthat see demand dry up for a while.\n3. This is a time for our best, together\nThe brainpower of our region and nation is needed more than ever, and it is important to continue being nimble,\ncreative, proactive, and, perhaps most importantly, collaborative – because the tactics and approaches that will help are\nlikely to be multifaceted and involve the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.\nThis is a time of challenge, but it’s also a time to bring out our very best.\n\nThis perspective summarizes remarks delivered at a forum hosted by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, held on\nApril 1, 2020.\n\n\fFigure 1: Federal Funds Rate\n1.75\n\nFigure 2: Prime and Government Money Market Fund\nAssets Under Management\n\nPercent\n\n3,600\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\n900\n\nGovernment (Left Scale)\n\n1.50\n\nPrime (Right Scale)\n\n1.25\n\n3,200\n\n800\n\n2,800\n\n700\n\n1.00\nEmergency\nFOMC\nMeetings\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n18-Feb-20\n\n03-Mar-20\n\n17-Mar-20\n\nFigure 3: Spread Between Highly-Rated Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Rate and the Federal Funds Rate\n1.9\n\nPercent\n\n2,400\n18-Feb-20\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n03-Mar-20\n\n17-Mar-20\n\n17-Mar-20\n\nFigure 4: Spread Between AA Corporate Bond Yield and\n5-Year Treasury Yield\n\n1.4\n\n-0.1\n18-Feb-20\n\n03-Mar-20\n\nPercent\n\n0\n18-Feb-20\n\n03-Mar-20\n\n17-Mar-20\n\nNote: All charts are daily, from February 18, 2020 through March 30, 2020.\nSources: (1) Federal Reserve Board, (2) iMoneyNet, (3) Bloomberg Finance L.P., Federal Reserve\nBoard, (4) ICE/BAML, Federal Reserve Board, (1,3,4) Haver Analytics\n\n600\n\n\f",

If one quarter or more of\nthe population ultimately acquires the virus, as seems well within the realm\nof possibility, the numbers therefore suggest that we will still face a very\nsignificant challenge. Medical services could be under significant stress\nproviding care to that volume of COVID-19 patients with serious illness.\nThe tactics that can dent a pandemic are, to be sure, somewhat disruptive.\nAnd inconvenient. But they are the right thing to do. And the time is now.\nWe’re talking about things like cancelling events that involve gatherings.\nAnd companies instituting work-from-home approaches for all who can.\nAnd, meanwhile, creatively supporting the workers who keep our\norganizations up and running, who cannot work from home. And doing what\nwe can to tide over workers and businesses for whom demand may dry up\nfor a while.\nThese steps may be difficult, and take some adjustment. But they might,\nover the coming days and weeks, mitigate the spread of the virus, and its\neconomic impact. And that is well worth it. The inconveniences could\nforestall much worse options.\nWe also need people to consider utilizing the healthcare system in publicspirited ways, such as practicing self-care if your symptoms are mild and if\nthe hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. People should also leave the\nsupply of medical equipment, like masks, to the professionals who\ndesperately need them.\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/03/esr_coronavirus-article.aspx[4/30/2020 8:52:34 AM]\n\n\fEmployer Responsibility in the Time of Coronavirus: A Joint Perspective - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nEmergency medicine requires preparation, agility, and action. Sometimes it\ninvolves triage and accepting difficult realities. Economic policymaking\nrequires a careful assessment of conditions, thinking hard about forecasts\nand possible outcomes, and the ways that actions now will have influence,\nwith lags.\nThese are all relevant for the COVID-19 crisis.\nWe encourage New Englanders to embrace this challenge – sacrificing\nsome convenience and normalcy now, in order to avoid much worse\noutcomes.\nEmployers have a special responsibility and opportunity, given the impact of\ntheir policies on the possible direction of the virus. Employers in regions\nwith significant outbreaks frequently waited too long to take action, waiting\nfor other companies’ actions or delayed responses from governmental\norganizations. That should not be the case in New England.\nWe encourage employers to:\nBe proactive, acting out of an abundance of caution, even without full\ncertainty, because steps we take now can prevent worse outcomes.\nTake tangible steps, particularly work-from-home approaches, restrictions on\nbusiness travel, and avoiding large meetings.\nPrioritize safety and illness prevention as the best way to blunt the effects of\nthe crisis and hasten the return to more normal times and less economic\nvolatility.\n\nIn sum, we all need to look beyond the immediate timeframe and the\nnarrowest horizons. Supporting our employees, dealing constructively with\ncustomers and clients, and using forbearance with those most affected by\nthe virus or its economic repercussions are ways all of us can help support\nthe region’s health outcomes and economic resilience.\nWith this orientation, New England’s employers and employees, and\nmedical providers and medical clients, will all do better – sooner – than they\notherwise would.\n\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/03/esr_coronavirus-article.aspx[4/30/2020 8:52:34 AM]\n\n\fEmployer Responsibility in the Time of Coronavirus: A Joint Perspective - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nSite Topics\nIn the Region\nRelated Content\nAn economic epicenter of coronavirus in New England: low-wage service workers\nBoston Fed employee and son help thousands with homemade solution to COVID-19 mask irritation\nDemand for H-1B Visas in New England: An Analysis of Employer Requests for Highly-Skilled Guest Workers\nBerkowitz, Gottlieb, Hooley reflect on Boston Fed board service during critical time\nSmall Employers and Expanded Health Insurance Coverage\n\nWATCH LIVE TODAY: Press conference with #FOMC Chair Powell at 2:30\np.m. ET: http://go.usa.gov/xy3aN\n\nAbout Us\n\nReserve Bank Services\n\nLeadership & Organization\n\nCash Services\n\nDoing Business With Us\n\nWholesale Payments\n\nContact Us\n\nCareers\n\nVisitor Information & Directions\n600 Atlantic Avenue\nBoston, MA 02210-2204\nmap\n(617) 973-3000\n\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/03/esr_coronavirus-article.aspx[4/30/2020 8:52:34 AM]\n\n\fEmployer Responsibility in the Time of Coronavirus: A Joint Perspective - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nGet email updates from the\nBostonFed\nTerms of Use & Privacy\n\nData Privacy\n\nSite Accessibility\n\nFeedback\n\n© Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/03/esr_coronavirus-article.aspx[4/30/2020 8:52:34 AM]\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks for a Panel Discussion at the\n2020 Spring Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee:\n“Current Monetary Policy: The Influence of\nMarvin Goodfriend”\n\nNew York, New York\nMarch 6, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for inviting me to\nparticipate on this panel – and more broadly for organizing a conference examining many of the\nchallenges policymakers have faced over the past 20 years. As many of you know, these were\nchallenges that Marvin Goodfriend anticipated, well before the Great Recession forced\npolicymakers to confront them. Specifically, our panel topic – monetary policy and the zero\nlower bound – is one that Marvin devoted a good deal of thought to. And as I’ll touch on today,\nhis emphasis on this topic proved prescient.\nI will focus my remarks on his paper, “Overcoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate\nPolicy,” that appeared in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking roughly 20 years ago. The\narticle was originally written for a Federal Reserve conference held in Woodstock, Vermont, in\nOctober 1999 – before most economists were thinking of this as a significant problem.1\nIndeed, in October 1999, the federal funds rate was 5.2 percent and the Federal Reserve\nwas increasing interest rates. In fact, the funds rate had not been below 2 percent since the early\n1960s, despite several severe recessions. The “job-loss” expansion in the mid-2000s had not yet\noccurred, nor had the Financial Crisis. And despite the developments in Japan, where short-term\nnominal rates hit zero in 1999, most economists considered it unlikely that the U.S. policy rate\nwould fall to zero. Moreover, the thinking was that in the highly unlikely event it did fall that\nfar, it would be there for only a quarter or two.\nFor several reasons, Marvin had the foresight to take seriously the possibility of zero\ninterest rates in the U.S. The zero interest rates prevailing in Japan at the time, together with a\nlow-inflation environment in many developed countries, prompted Marvin to revisit and expand\non an issue that had been examined previously, in the context of the Great Depression. In fact, I\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nhad numerous discussions with Marvin about Japan’s “Lost Decade” of the 1990s, and what its\nrelevance could be for future monetary policymaking.\nIn our conversations and in his 1999 paper, Marvin emphasized two policies that were\nactually implemented, later, in response to the Financial Crisis – negative interest rates, which\nwere adopted in Europe and Japan; and open market purchases of long bonds, which were\nimplemented in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.\nOn the first, Marvin highlighted that negative nominal interest rates might be helpful in a\nsignificant economic downturn when the policy rate had already reached zero. Although many\ndismissed this suggestion, given the higher (zero) return to holding currency, Marvin focused on\nthe technical issues regarding the central bank’s ability to charge negative nominal rates on bank\nreserves. Yet Marvin realized that even if policymakers could succeed in charging negative\ninterest rates, and possibly help the overall economy recover, he correctly noted that such a\npolicy could “create stress for lenders and people heavily dependent on interest income.”\nOn the second policy, the open-market purchases of long-term bonds that Marvin\ndiscussed were ultimately employed during the Financial Crisis in almost every developed\ncountry. He viewed these asset purchases as an important part of the monetary policy toolbox,\nparticularly when short-term rates approached their lower bound. However, he advocated that\nthe U.S. Treasury Department should agree to indemnify the central bank against capital losses.\nIndeed, he understood the potential political pitfalls a central bank would face in such an\nenvironment. I would point out that this type of indemnification was done in the U.K., but not in\nthe United States.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOverall, Marvin showed a great deal of intellectual dexterity at a time when the United\nStates was far from seeing short-term rates approach the zero bound. In many respects, his paper\nprovided a prescient preview of many of the actions ultimately taken by global central banks\nduring the Financial Crisis.\nOf course, some of the operational suggestions, such as implementing a carry-tax on\ncurrency, were unlikely to get much political traction, despite their potential ability to make his\npolicy suggestions more effective. But the clarity in Marvin’s thinking and the boldness of his\nsuggestions highlight the creative intellect that characterized much of his work.\nNow that we have the experience of the Financial Crisis and the resulting Great\nRecession, we should ask ourselves some important questions. What further issues should\npolicymakers consider as we confront the current low-interest-rate environment, given the\npotential for adverse shocks? And, with more than 20 years of experience since Marvin wrote\nhis paper, what additional concerns should we have?\nI’ll offer three observations on those questions.\nFirst, Marvin foresaw another element of the current situation that few anticipated – that\nthe equilibrium real rate of interest might fall to a very low level. In fact, in the time since he\nwrote his paper in the late 1990s, the amount of “space” for monetary policy to operate before\nhitting the effective lower bound has diminished significantly. Indeed, we are in a low-interestrate environment for reasons that go beyond the low-inflation environment emphasized in\nMarvin’s paper, and this may have implications for the effectiveness of the policy solutions at\nthe zero lower bound.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSpecifically, in June 2007 – prior to the Financial Crisis – the effective federal funds rate\nand the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate were above 5 percent. While the federal funds rate ultimately\nfell to zero in 2008, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate did not, as Marvin anticipated. Long rates at\nthe time remained above zero. Now, however, for a variety of reasons, the federal funds rate is\nat only 1.1 percent (the target range being 1 to 1.25 percent), and the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate\nfell below 1 percent this week. As investors are more aware of the likelihood of short-term rates\nhitting the zero lower bound, they have been more willing to use U.S. Treasury bonds as hedges\nagainst recession risk.\nOn January 21, around the time of the first U.S. coronavirus cases, the 10-year U.S.\nTreasury rate was 1.8 percent. With on-going concerns about the coronavirus, the 10-year rate\ndeclined by roughly 80 basis points. If the economic reaction to the coronavirus does result in\nthe funds rate falling to its effective lower bound, this heightened sensitivity of the 10-year U.S.\nTreasury rate to adverse news raises the possibility that the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate could\nfollow close behind. In fact, this “co-movement” has been the case for some time in many\ncountries. As a result, there would be little room for the Federal Reserve to lower rates through\nlarge purchases of long-term Treasury securities – like it did to make conditions more\naccommodative in and after the Great Recession – if a recession occurred in this rate\nenvironment.\nSuch a situation would raise challenges policymakers did not face even during the Great\nRecession. In such a case, as Marvin highlighted in his 1999 article, we should allow the central\nbank to purchase a broader range of securities or assets. Such a policy, however, would require a\nchange in the Federal Reserve Act. And I agree with Marvin’s analysis that if the Federal\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nReserve pursued such a policy, it should possess an explicit agreement with the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment to indemnify the Fed against losses. Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could\nconsider a facility that could buy a broader set of assets, provided the Treasury agreed to provide\nindemnification.\nSecond, while Marvin felt that negative interest rates might be effective and could be\nmade operational, I will say that I remain skeptical. Marvin recognized potential side effects, but\nI personally view the adverse side effects as likely quite large. Marvin noted negative rates\nwould pose a significant challenge for banks, and I more than agree with him. We need banks to\nbe healthy enough to provide credit and liquidity in challenging economic times.\nCompared with banks in the United States, banks in Europe and Japan – where rates have\nbeen negative for some time – have lower price-to-book ratios, lower return on assets, and lower\nleverage ratios. While there are many factors influencing these comparatively lackluster metrics,\nI would suggest that negative interest rates have been part of the problem.2\nIn my view, negative interest rates poorly position an economy to recover from a\ndownturn. And other actions that have helped support banks in Japan and Europe might not be\npolitically feasible in the United States.\nIn addition, many developed countries have financial stability authorities that have tools\nto potentially limit excessive leverage for households and firms. It is important to note that the\nUnited States has no such organization with the authority and tools to restrain excessive leverage\nfrom developing in a low-interest-rate environment. And while the U.S. Congress could, for\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, March 6, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nexample, limit the tax deductibility of debt when it involves excessive leverage, such tax reform\nseems unlikely any time soon.\nThird, and finally, I view the recent experience of countries with negative rates as\nevidence that such a policy would not be particularly successful in stimulating economic activity.\nIn part, concerns with retirement and pension arrangements in an environment of negative rates\nhave caused saving rates to rise, not fall, in some of these countries – meaning that consumers\nare less willing to spend and fuel the economic recovery. In addition, firms’ behavior does not\nseem to respond very strongly to negative rates. Further, while the exchange rate effects from\ninterest rate changes can be important for firms, they become virtually nonexistent if every\ncountry moves their rates into negative territory.\nIn a low-interest-rate environment, the obvious alternative to monetary policy in a\ndownturn is to depend on fiscal policy shouldering a greater share of the burden for providing\nneeded stimulus to the economy. Somewhat surprisingly, there seems to be little movement\ntoward making automatic stabilizers more prominent, or preparing to invest significantly more in\nthe sorts of public investment projects that yield positive returns.\nIn 1999, Marvin Goodfriend was able to consider what had not occurred in the recent\npast, and contemplate bold alternatives. Over the next few years, that type of vision and\nboldness will be needed by all policymakers if we have to consider how policy should react to\nany large, adverse shock to the economy.\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n2 P.M.

U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON\nDELIVERY\n\n“The Economic Outlook – and Two Risks to the\nForecast that are Worth Watching”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nEconomic Summit + Outlook 2020\nConnecticut Business & Industry Association\n\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 13, 2020\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning, it is a pleasure to be with you today. Participating in the CBIA’s outlook\nevent is always a great way to start the new year.\nWe end 2019 and begin 2020 with an economy that is doing quite well. The labor market\nis strong, with the national unemployment rate at 50-year lows. Inflation is somewhat below 2\npercent, the Federal Reserve’s target, but is projected to gradually return to 2 percent.\nIn addition, most professional forecasters are expecting the good news to continue in\n2020. The consensus forecast has real GDP growing roughly at potential; the unemployment\nrate remaining near its historically low range of last year; and inflation approaching the Fed’s 2\npercent target. Financial markets, too, appear optimistic about the economy’s prospects, with\nstock market indices ending the year close to all-time highs.\nThese elements of the forecast for 2020 have not changed much over the past year. Yet\nthe current outlook for 2020 is conditioned on a much more accommodative stance for monetary\npolicy. At this time last year, the members of the Fed’s monetary policy committee – the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC – were anticipating interest rate increases, given the tight\nlabor markets and the expectation that inflationary pressures would build as a result. With the\noutbreak of trade-related concerns and worries over a potential global slowdown, the FOMC\nvoted to reduce the federal funds rate three times during 2019 to insure against the risk of an\neconomic downturn. As we closed out the year, it was clear that labor markets remained strong\nand the economy continued to grow faster than its estimated potential.\nIn the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), FOMC members provided\ntheir outlooks for economic conditions in 2020, the consensus of which was quite similar to that\nof private forecasters. The SEP forecast also includes a projection of expected monetary policy\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrates, the so-called dot plot, which shows the path for monetary policy consistent with FOMC\nmembers’ forecasts. The December dot plot showed no change in the median interest rate from\n2019 to 2020, but has rates rising very gradually next year and beyond. Such a forecast reflects\nwhat the FOMC policymakers think is the most likely outcome, but it goes without saying that\nthe economy rarely evolves exactly as expected.\nToday, I will focus on the economic outlook for 2020 – and two potential risks to the\noutlook that could arise, should the economy grow faster than expected due to the\naccommodative stance of monetary policy.\nThe first potential risk I will discuss has to do with the acceleration of inflation, in that\nthere is the possibility that labor markets could tighten to unsustainable levels, causing\ninflationary pressures to build faster than the very gradual pace that is currently expected. The\nsecond potential risk I will discuss has to do with financial stability, in that persistently low\ninterest rates could lead consumers and firms to take on riskier financial investments in search of\nbetter returns, increasing asset prices to unsustainable levels. There are also, of course, risks that\nthe economy could underperform, and these derive primarily from geopolitical and trade risks. I\nhave focused some on these risks in previous talks.1 But to preview my conclusion: If these risks\nremain contained, my view is we will likely have another year of good economic outcomes.\n\nOverview of the Economic Outlook\nOver the most recent two quarters, real GDP has grown close to 2 percent, somewhat\nabove what economists believe is the economy’s potential growth rate. My own estimate of that\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrate is about 1.75 percent. By that calculus, the economy has recently been growing somewhat\nfaster than its potential rate, and correspondingly unemployment declined a bit, over 2019.\nFigure 1 shows actual GDP growth as a solid line, and then provides the forecast of\nFOMC participants (the median of their projections in the SEP) through 2022, shown as squares.\nIt shows that the median forecast of Fed policymakers is for future real GDP growth to be 2\npercent in 2020, then 1.9 percent in 2021, and then 1.8 percent in 2022.2 The SEP also includes\nthe median of estimates for growth in the longer run (potential growth), which is 1.9 percent –\nslightly higher than my own estimate. But in sum, the median of these forecasts anticipates\nannual GDP growth to be around the level we have seen recently, and close to Committee\nmembers’ estimates of potential.\nTurning from growth to labor markets, over the past nine months the unemployment rate\nhas remained in a relatively tight band, ranging from 3.5 to 3.7 percent. As is consistent with a\ngrowth estimate close to the economy’s potential, the median forecast of Fed policymakers is for\nthe unemployment rate to remain in this narrow band, as Figure 2 shows.\nFOMC members’ current median estimate of the unemployment rate in the longer run is\n4.1 percent. This estimate has declined noticeably over the past two years, as the actual\nunemployment rate fell below 4 percent and even so, inflation remained somewhat below the\nFed’s 2 percent target. My own estimates are for the unemployment rate to be somewhat below\nthe SEP median projections for 2020 through 2022, and for longer-run unemployment to be\nsomewhat higher than the Committee’s median projection of 4.1 percent.\nTurning to prices, the inflation rate has continued to be somewhat lower than the Fed’s 2\npercent inflation target. The SEP median forecast has core inflation ending 2020 at 1.9 percent\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand hitting the 2 percent target in the following two years, as shown in Figure 3. By the way, it\nis worth noting that while the current core inflation rate is only 1.6 percent, there were very low\nreadings last spring which will fall out of the annual average this spring. And more recent\nannualized quarterly readings have been much closer to 2 percent. So while there remains\nuncertainty about the trajectory for inflation, I personally do expect readings at or around the 2\npercent target in the future.\nIn addition, the current federal funds rate is well below the 2.5 percent rate the\nCommittee expects in the longer run, so monetary policy is currently accommodative. Given the\nstability of the forecasts for GDP growth, unemployment and inflation, it is not surprising that\nthe median forecast for interest rates (shown in Figure 4) is for no change this year and gradual\nincreases over the next two years. Certainly, the lack of inflationary pressure to date has\nprovided one justification for accommodative monetary policy despite the duration of the\nrecovery and a current historically low unemployment rate. However, maintaining interest rates\nbelow the consensus longer-run “equilibrium” interest rate is predicated on both inflationary\npressures not building up and financial stability concerns being contained.\nOverall, the SEP medians project a very benign outlook, with what can be considered an\nalmost ideal economic outcome: Inflation returning to target, labor markets remaining quite\nstrong, and economic growth close to potential. However, as I mentioned in my introduction, the\nworld rarely unfolds exactly as forecast. So it is important to consider some of the risks that\ncould cause significant deviations from this rather positive forecast.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRisks to the Forecast: Acceleration of Inflation\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the inflation rate has fairly persistently undershot the\nFed’s target of 2 percent, which we use in pursuing our assigned mandate of price stability.\nUndershooting the target for most of the period since the crisis was not especially surprising,\ngiven the slack in resource utilization caused by the severe recession. However, the more recent\nabsence of significant inflationary pressures – despite very low unemployment rates – has been\nmore surprising. In fact, given historically low unemployment rates, most forecasters have\nsystematically expected more inflation than has actually occurred.\nThe inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate – high\nunemployment is associated with lower inflation, other things equal, and vice versa – is often\nreferred to as the “Phillips Curve,” named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who first\nobserved the regularity of the pattern. This relationship was more apparent up until the mid1990s, but it has become noticeably weaker over the past 25 years. There are many potential\nexplanations for the smaller effect of unemployment on inflation, including the somewhat\ndiminished size and influence of labor unions and more effective inflation targeting by central\nbanks. Whatever the reasons, the relationship has undeniably weakened, with inflation\nremaining below 2 percent despite the unemployment rate reaching 50-year lows.\nOne implication of low inflation and low nominal interest rates is that there is very little\nroom for monetary policy to react to an economic downturn by reducing rates. Currently, with\nnominal interest rates and inflation below two percent, Fed policymakers have much less room to\nreduce short-term interest rates before hitting the effective lower bound than they did in recent\nrecessions. In addition, prevailing long-term rates are lower, because of lower expected inflation\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand lower inflation risk premia. This leaves policymakers with less room to use large-scale asset\npurchases to push down long-term rates, should they hit the effective lower bound with the shortterm rates they influence.3\nWhile private forecasts and the Fed’s SEP expect low inflation and low interest rates, I\nwould note that this is predicated on inflation continuing to be tame. However, we should\nacknowledge that there are relatively few cases where the unemployment rate and the Fed’s\npolicy interest rate both remained well below their estimated long-run values for an extended\ntime.\nAs a result, one risk that could alter the outlook is if inflationary pressures build up more\nquickly than currently expected. Admittedly, with little room currently to lower rates in a\ndownturn, inflation somewhat exceeding projections could be a good thing. But economists do\nnot have a very precise understanding of how inflation expectations form, and of course an\neconomy eventually running too hot could increase inflationary pressures.\nFigure 5 shows that average hourly earnings have been trending up over the past five\nyears, although in the most recent report released last Friday, the preliminary figures indicate a\npause, which will be followed closely in terms of the trend. While some of this increase is\nconsistent with wages that reflect inflation a bit below 2 percent, and productivity growth of\nabout 1 percent, we see some evidence that a strong labor market is placing additional upward\npressure on wages, as the wages of nonsupervisory workers have risen more quickly. Let me be\nclear – sustainable wage growth is a good thing. But with higher minimum wages, and more\nwage pressures for low-wage workers, wage inflation that noticeably exceeds the sum of\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproductivity growth and inflation may result in price pressures, particularly in sectors that do not\nface import competition, such as services.\nAgain, to some degree, wage increases need not be inflationary if they are offset by\nincreased productivity. However, the growth in productivity has been modest in recent years, as\nshown in Figure 6.\nAlso, real wage gains in excess of productivity growth tend to be reflected in a\nweakening of corporate profits relative to GDP. As shown in Figure 7, corporate profits relative\nto GDP have been tailing off in recent years. While lower corporate profit margins are one way\nto absorb wage pressures without raising prices, relatively lower corporate earnings of late may\nmake absorbing increased wage costs less likely.\nTo the extent that firms are unable or unwilling to absorb the rising costs as wages\nrespond to low unemployment, we may observe the associated inflation risk materializing.\nAdmittedly, most forecasters do not expect this in their modal (most likely outcome) forecast.\nBut more rapid than expected inflation remains a risk of running the economy with\naccommodative monetary policy and tight labor markets.\n\nRisks to the Forecast: Financial Stability\nAs a practical matter, central bankers do not have much historical experience with\nextended periods where interest rates are running below the estimated equilibrium level while\nunemployment rates are, simultaneously, historically low. So we want to be alert to any\npotential risks emerging. In my view, another potential risk is that low interest rates and a\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbooming economy will encourage investors to increasingly “reach for yield” – that is, they will\ntake on more risk in order to raise the nominal returns they are receiving (since the associated\nrisk premiums embedded in the returns to riskier assets compensate for that added risk).4\nReal estate is an area of the economy that is historically susceptible to this risk-taking.\nBoth residential and commercial real estate are sensitive to the level of interest rates, and are\nwidely held as collateral by leveraged financial institutions.5 Some of the more severe\nrecessions, both in the U.S. and abroad, have occurred when real estate prices collapsed and the\nfinancial positions of highly leveraged institutions and households became precarious. That is,\nthe debt they held came to greatly exceed the value of the assets they had borrowed against.\nFigure 8 shows the change in house prices relative to per capita personal income since\n2015, for the United States and several European nations. An increase in the index indicates\npurchasing a home is less affordable, as income is not increasing as rapidly as house prices. The\nindex has risen almost 10 percent in the U.S. since 2015, as housing prices have been rising\nfaster than per capita personal income. In some countries – like Portugal, the Netherlands, and\nGermany, the index and house prices have risen much more sharply since 2015. Low interest\nrates – in some cases negative – may be spurring house price increases.\nSimilarly, there continue to be decreases in the capitalization rates of commercial real\nestate properties. A low capitalization rate – the ratio of net operating income to the price of the\nproperty, at the time of the transaction, shown in Figure 9 – implies relatively high valuations\ncompared to the income the property is expected to generate, which is a sign of inflated asset\nprices. Fortunately, some sectors have seen capitalization rates decreasing less rapidly of late.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn sum, it is important to see and understand the risk that sustained low interest rates\ncould place more pressure on real estate asset prices through reach-for-yield behavior – a\nscenario that preceded the 1990 and 2007 recessions. In certain scenarios, financial stability\nrisks could potentially emerge as a problem for the otherwise benign outlook.\n\nConcluding Observations\nTo summarize and conclude, private forecasters and FOMC participants anticipate a good\noutcome for the economy in 2020 and beyond, with low inflation and strong labor markets.\nHowever, as with any forecast, there are risk scenarios that are not captured in the most likely\noutcome for the economy. I have highlighted two potential risks that I will be monitoring this\nyear – inflation picking up more than currently expected; and asset prices, particularly real estate\nprices, showing evidence of more acute financial stability risks. To be fair, there are also\ndownside risks to the economic outlook, as well – primarily centered on the potential for trade\ndisruptions and slowing growth among our trading partners. But I see the potential risks to\ninflation and financial stability as somewhat more concerning, overall.\nThank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s forum. Best wishes to all in\nConnecticut, New England, and the nation for a positive and prosperous 2020.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n10:05 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, January 13, 2020 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n1\n\nFor example, see additional discussion in my talk, “Exploring Economic Conditions and the Implications for Monetary Policy,” Oct. 11, 2019.\n\n2\n\nMeasured on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.\n\n3\n\nCurrently, with nominal interest rates below 2 percent, Fed policymakers have less than 2 percentage points to lower rates in the event of a\ndownturn – less than one-half the amount by which they typically lowered rates to fight past recessions. In addition, prevailing long-term rates\nare lower now than in the past because of lower expected inflation, lower inflation risk premia, and the lower term premia that our large-scale\nasset purchases engendered. This leaves policymakers with correspondingly less room to lower long-term rates through such purchases, a policy\nthat proved effective in spurring the economy following the last recession once the Fed had pushed short-term interest rates to their effective\nlower bound. The lack of room to cut rates if needed certainly amplifies any downside risk to the forecast.\nSee, for example, Lina Lu, Matthew Pritsker, Andrei Zlate, Kenechukwu Anadu, and Jim Bohn, “Reach for Yield by U.S. Public Pension\nFunds,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Supervisory Research and Analysis Working Papers 2019, Series 19-2. Other papers have found reachfor-yield behavior in other investor types, including insurance companies.\n4\n\n5\n\nFor more discussion, see my talk, “Financial Stability and Regulatory Policy in a Low Interest Rate Environment,” Nov. 11, 2019.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Forecasters Club of New York\n\nNew York, New York\nDecember 17, 2019\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to New York to address the Forecasters\nClub. As we close out a year and begin to look to a new one, it is a great time to be talking about\nforecasts and the economic outlook.\nI’ll begin with a summary overview, and then walk you through some key data.\nThe economy continues to perform quite well, as the December employment report from\nthe Labor Department highlighted. We have strong labor markets, with the unemployment rate\nreturning to its 50-year low. And the reported job growth of 266,000 was a nice surprise,\nparticularly for retailers hoping for strong holiday sales. Consistent with the positive news in the\nemployment report, retailers I have talked with have been optimistic about holiday sales.\nFortunately for the economy, many consumers seem to be in a buying mood.\nSince April, the economy has performed pretty much as many professional forecasters\nexpected – this, despite recent concerns with downside risks, notably those associated with\nslower global growth and uncertainty about trade policy. While the composition of real GDP has\nbeen somewhat different than expected by many forecasts from late spring, GDP growth and\nunemployment have generally been quite close to what was forecast – for example in the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s quarterly survey of\nroughly 50 forecasters.\nSeveral months ago the financial news seemed to highlight the increasing likelihood of an\neconomic downturn, but more recently those concerns appear to have subsided. In fact, the\noutlooks of most private forecasters have consistently centered on continued growth in the\neconomy, even while the prognosticators who focus on financial variables such as the slope of\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nyield curve have placed a higher probability on an economic downturn. In other words, financial\nmarket practitioners may have priced in slightly more risk to the economy, but economic\nforecasters saw the most likely outcome as economic expansion.\nMy own view is that it is unlikely we will have an economic downturn in the coming\nyear, given the generally positive financial conditions and the continued accommodative\nmonetary and fiscal policies. Of course, this outlook assumes that we do not have a significant\nnegative shock from abroad, or experience a negative shock from a sharp ratcheting up of trade\ndisputes with major trading partners.1\nWith the recent positive economic news, and with monetary and fiscal policy already\naccommodative, I see no need to make the current stance of monetary policy more\naccommodative in the near term. Given that monetary policy works with lags, and Federal\nReserve policymakers have already eased monetary policy three times in 2019, my view is that it\nis appropriate to take a patient approach to considering any policy changes, unless there is a\nmaterial change to the outlook.\nI would like to turn now to why my perspective on the economy is optimistic. I’ll review\nboth the forecasts and economic data, to explain my outlook.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nTurning to the data, Figure 1 shows the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ outlook for\nthe unemployment rate, and the actual data for the first three quarters of the year. Since April,\nthe unemployment rate has moved in a tight range. In April, the unemployment rate was 3.6\npercent, and in November the unemployment rate was little changed at 3.5 percent. In the\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nintervening period, it fluctuated in a range from 3.5 to 3.7 percent. November’s Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters shows that forecasters expect the unemployment rate to remain in this\nrange for the next year. In addition, the shaded region shows the spread between the 25th and\n75th percentile forecasts is quite narrow. My own forecast is quite similar, in that I believe the\nunemployment rate will likely fluctuate narrowly around its current value.\nFigure 2 provides actuals for the first three quarters of the year and the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters expectations for core inflation – which is measured using the Personal\nConsumption Expenditures, or PCE, price index.2 In early 2019, core PCE inflation was lower\nthan expected. However, most forecasters continue to believe that shortfall reflected temporary\nfactors – and thus they expect the core PCE, which has subsequently risen, to remain close to the\nFed’s 2 percent inflation target in 2020.3 My own forecast is quite similar. I expect that given\nthe strong labor market, PCE inflation should move in a narrow range around the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget.\nFigure 3 provides actual and forecast real GDP growth. The economy has grown at close\nto a 2 percent annual rate over the past two quarters, as strength in the household sector has\nlargely offset the weakness in business investment. That pattern is likely to continue, as\nconsumer spending is bolstered by job creation, increases in personal income, and increases in\nwealth. In addition, the recent monetary policy easing is likely to continue to bolster the housing\nsector.\nOverall the median forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters look quite\nsimilar to my own. The U.S. economy is quite solid, and barring an unexpected adverse shock,\nmy view is that the economy is currently well positioned for the coming year. And, depending\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\non one’s view about potential GDP growth – because growth above potential implies lower\nunemployment – it is an economy where labor markets might be expected to strengthen further.\nRisks to the Economic Forecast\nOf course, the global economy still faces a number of downside risks. Yet, some of the\nconcerns surrounding trade and global growth that were elevated earlier this year appear to have\nabated somewhat. As you may recall, earlier this fall there was significant discussion about a\nrising probability of a recession in 2020. These concerns were particularly elevated around the\ntime that trade discussions seemed to falter, and financial market participants became concerned\nthat the temporarily inverted slope of the yield curve was portending an imminent slowdown.4\nDespite the concerns raised by financial market participants, most economic forecasters\nassessed a low probability of a recession. The Survey of Professional Forecasters asks\nparticipants in the survey to provide their assessment of the probability distribution of outcomes\nfor variables such as real GDP, for the coming year. Figure 4 provides the average of\nprobabilities based on that survey. The figure shows most of the distribution of forecasts for real\nGDP fall in the 1 to 3 percent range. Very little of the distribution is associated with\nprobabilities of negative real GDP, which is consistent with a low likelihood of a recession next\nyear.\nTo a large extent, these probabilities likely reflect the strong household sector numbers I\nmentioned earlier. Figure 5 shows the growth in real consumer spending, which has been quite\nstrong over the past two quarters. As previously mentioned, plentiful jobs and growth in income\nhave provided improvements in confidence and bode well for holiday sales and beyond.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTrends in the saving rate and household wealth (net worth) shown in Figure 6 also\nhighlight why the consumer is well positioned to spend. Both the saving rate and household net\nworth are trending upward simultaneously and have been for some time now, bringing their\nlevels to near highs. As you can see from the portion of the chart before the last recession, the\ntwo don’t typically move in the same direction.\nFigure 7 shows that after a series of quarters in which real residential investment fell, the\nhousing sector appears to be responding to lower interest rates in the marketplace. Of course, the\nlower mortgage rates are partly spurred by the Federal Open Market Committee’s 75 basis point\nreduction in the federal funds rate, as shown in Figure 8.\nFigure 9 shows one reason that a measure of the slope of the yield curve may not always\npredict an economic downturn, as I have discussed in recent talks. The blue line displays one\nmeasure of the slope — the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate minus the 3-month Treasury rate. The\ngreen line shows the real federal funds rate, minus the estimated real equilibrium rate. Positive\nvalues of this series are meant to capture times when the Fed is pursuing restrictive monetary\npolicy, and vice versa for negative values. In the periods preceding the previous two recessions,\nthe Federal Reserve took a more restrictive monetary policy stance in response to rising wages\nand prices. The more restrictive monetary policy in these episodes raised the short-term interest\nrates enough to cause an inversion of the yield curve.\nIn each of the past three recessions, the green line has been in positive territory – simply\nmeaning that monetary policy became more restrictive (the policy rate set by the Fed was higher\nthan the estimate of the equilibrium rate) at the same time that the yield curve flattened or\ninverted. In the most recent period, the real federal funds rate has remained below the\nequilibrium interest rate estimate. Of course, the true value of the equilibrium interest rate (“r5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nstar” or r*) is uncertain, and estimates have been declining for some time. Yet if the estimate is\naccurate, with the recent 75 basis points of reduction the federal funds rate is now much lower\nthan the estimated equilibrium rate.5 If a negative slope of the yield curve was, in part,\npredictive because of its association with tightening monetary policy, it may be less predictive in\ncurrent circumstances – because unlike the other historical episodes, monetary policy continues\nto be accommodative.\nAn inverted yield curve isn’t the only risk to the economic outlook, however. Figure 10\nhighlights another reason why some analysts have been concerned about a possible recession.\nThe purchasing managers’ survey from the Institute for Supply Management provides both\nmanufacturing and nonmanufacturing indices, where observations above 50 indicate increases in\nactivity, and observations below 50 indicate declines. A decline in manufacturing is sometimes a\nleading indicator of a potential recession. And at times, such declines have sometimes predicted\nrecessions that never occurred.\nAs an alternative, note that the past two recessions were associated with sub-50 readings\nfor both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys. As just noted, when only the\nmanufacturing sector has fallen below 50, it has not been a reliable predictor of a recession. One\ncould argue that the current reading has the potential to be another such false signal, given\ncurrent events. In particular, since tariffs are particularly focused on traded goods, it is not\nsurprising that manufacturing has been weak. However, the services that account for the\nnonmanufacturing index movement have held up quite well, since these industries have not been\nas directly impacted by the trade disputes.\nFigure 11 illustrates another indication that financial conditions remain accommodative:\nthe very low 10-year Treasury term premium. In other words, not only is the federal funds rate\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 17, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbelow the equilibrium rate, but long rates also remain quite low by historical standards. The\nterm premium is likely low, at least in part, because many developed countries are still\nconducting quantitative easing, making U.S. Treasuries look quite attractive by comparison,\nboosting their demand and depressing the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate.\nWith both fiscal and monetary policy being accommodative, financial conditions\nsupportive, and recent data positive, I agree with the surveyed professional forecasters that the\nlikelihood of a recession in 2020 is relatively low. However, a low probability does not mean it\ncannot happen, and certainly a negative shock from abroad or a significant flare up in trade\ndisputes could change the outlook significantly. Hence, as always, it is appropriate to continue\nto closely monitor incoming data.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, my view is that the economy is currently in a good place.\nLabor markets are strong, inflation is moving to target, and growth is likely to be somewhat\nabove potential. Particularly given the recent cuts in the federal funds rate, and the fact that\nmonetary actions take effect with some lag, I would say that this is a good time to patiently\nassess the economy. In the short run, I do not see a need for additional policy easing unless there\nis a material change to the forecast.\nThank you, and best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year.\n\nFor additional discussion, see: Rosengren, Eric: “Exploring Economic Conditions and the Implications for\nMonetary Policy,” Oct. 11, 2019.\n1\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n1:00 P.M.

NORWAY Time)\non Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Financial Stability and Regulatory Policy in a\nLow Interest Rate Environment”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nKeynote address at the Norges Bank and\nInternational Banking, Economics and Finance\nAssociation Workshop: “Prepared for the Next\nCrisis? The Costs and Benefits of Financial\nRegulation”\n\nOslo, Norway\nNovember 11, 2019\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood afternoon. I would like to thank the Norges Bank for inviting me to participate in\nthis timely and important conference. As someone with a background in both economic research\nand bank supervision, I believe the conversations taking place over these two days around reexamining bank regulation and financial stability are very important. It is particularly important\nat this stage of the business cycle to assess whether our economies are prepared for a\nhypothetical next downturn, and consider whether policymakers have built sufficient resilience\ninto the financial system – so it can withstand the kinds of stability problems that were so\nprevalent in the last recession.\nOne significant difference between now and previous cycles is the low level of interest\nrates in the United States, Germany, and Japan. The low-rate environment is particularly striking\nbecause it occurs at a time when all three countries’ labor markets remain relatively tight by\nhistorical standards.\nPolicy rates in the United States are currently quite low. This is partly a result of low\nequilibrium real rates globally, and low inflation targets. But it is also due to the Federal\nReserve setting its policy rate quite low, to offset risks to the U.S. economy stemming from\ntariffs and the global slowdown. Although core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent and the\nunemployment rate sits near a 50-year low, nominal interest rates have been reduced and shortterm real rates are now negative.\nWith rates this low, there is very little room to reduce short-term rates should the\neconomy stumble, as the Fed normally cuts rates well over 4 percentage points during a\nrecession. Similarly, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has declined, which limits the room to push\nlong-term sovereign rates down in a hypothetical economic downturn.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTaken together, one might characterize the situation as one where monetary policy\n“buffers” have been diminished quite significantly. This limitation on monetary policy’s ability\nto buffer the economy in a downturn is a key consequence of economies operating in a low\ninterest rate environment. In the U.S., the likelihood that this low interest rate environment will\npose a persistent challenge for conventional interest rate policy is one reason the central bank has\nbegun to re-examine its monetary policy framework.1\nAnd the Federal Reserve is not the only developed-economy central bank facing this\nissue. Increasingly, there are questions about whether too much is, even now, being asked of\nmonetary policy in Germany and Japan, for example. In these countries, the room for monetary\npolicy to react to significant negative shocks is even more meager than in the U.S., given that\nboth short-term and long-term nominal interest rates are already negative.\nWith the constraints on traditional monetary policy’s ability to buffer or help reduce the\neffects of a downturn, many countries have begun to re-examine other ways monetary policy can\nbe pursued to stimulate their economies. Besides the tools that have already been deployed at\nthe effective lower bound, I would suggest that the low rate environment and the diminished\ncapacity of monetary policy to offset shocks implies that we also need to just as carefully\nexamine regulatory and financial stability tools.2 Today, I will argue that policies and tools that\nmay have been appropriate in a high interest rate environment will likely not be sufficient in the\ncurrent environment.\nFor several reasons, a low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to exit\nrecessions. This difficulty is due not just to the smaller monetary policy buffer, but also to the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfact that a low interest rate environment encourages greater household and firm leverage that will\namplify the severity of a downturn, should it occur.\nThe consequences of a low rate environment also make it difficult for monetary policy to\nplay a solo role in countercyclical policy. A low-rate environment implies a greater need to\nutilize countercyclical fiscal policy, as well as a need for larger regulatory and financial-stability\nbuffers. For example, the recent and prospective decline in some capital ratios puts banks in a\nless advantageous position, particularly if one expects a low interest rate environment to prevail\nfor some time.\nIn short, the low interest rate environment that many developed countries face requires\npolicymakers to re-examine other economic buffers. And those buffers, in my view, are not\nadequate at present in many countries represented at this conference.\n\nLow Interest Rates and the Implications of a Diminished Monetary Policy Buffer\nFigure 1 shows the short-term policy rates in the United States, the Euro Area, and\nJapan. In the U.S., prior to the last recession, the federal funds rate was over 5 percent. On\naverage over the past six recessions, the Fed has lowered the funds rate by about 5 percentage\npoints. Had the Great Recession not been quite so severe, the 5 percentage points of federal\nfunds decrease available at its start might have been sufficient to offset the downturn. But\nbecause of the financial crisis and the severity of the ensuing recession, despite dropping the\nfederal funds rate quickly to zero, the recession was still historically severe and sustained. The\nfunds rate was pinned at just above zero for seven years, far longer than any model predicted\nwould be necessary before the recession. Even as the eleventh year of the recovery begins, the\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfederal funds rate has never exceeded 2.4 percent, and as I noted a few moments ago, the Fed has\nonce again lowered the funds rate to mitigate the risks of a global slowdown and trade disputes.\nAs a result, while the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. is relatively benign, shortterm interest rates in the U.S. have limited room to react to a significant adverse shock. In\nGermany and Japan, where the economic outcomes have not been as encouraging, short-term\nrates remain negative, despite being over a decade from the financial crisis.\nSo how is policy to respond?\nOne reaction to the limitations on lowering short-term policy rates in the wake of the\nGreat Recession has been for central banks to use their balance sheets to push down long-term\nrates. These quantitative easings and maturity transformations could be considered the\n“traditional nontraditional\" policies. However, Figure 2 shows that the buffer for this alternate\nmonetary policy tool is also in a somewhat diminished state. In the U.S., the 10-year Treasury\nrate has fluctuated recently between 1.5 and 2 percent, below the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.\nIn Germany and Japan, 10-year nominal rates are already negative, providing very little, if any,\ncapacity for monetary policy stimulus using balance sheet actions.\nWhile we don’t know exactly how long low rates will last, some of the underlying factors\nproducing low equilibrium rates are likely to persist. Slowing population growth and aging\npopulations are with us for the duration. We can hope for improved productivity gains, and that\nmay happen, but we do not see signs yet of a convincing resurgence in trend productivity growth.\nFigure 3 provides the median and central tendency around what the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), the U.S. monetary policy decision-making body, expects the federal funds\nrate to be in the longer run. The estimate of the longer-run nominal federal funds rate has\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndeclined significantly just since 2014, and the most recent median estimate of 2.5 percent is the\nlowest it has been over the past five years.\nThe implications of the diminished monetary policy buffer are significant. Monetary\npolicy has been the tool of choice to provide countercyclical stimulus during much of the\npostwar era. Given the current diminished monetary policy buffer, recessions may be deeper and\nrecoveries slower than what we have experienced historically, unless additional buffers are\nprovided by fiscal, regulatory, and financial stability policies and deemed appropriate to utilize\nby policymakers.\n\nImplications for the Banking System\nOne implication of a low interest rate environment with limited monetary policy buffers\nis that recoveries from future recessions may be more shallow, possibly resulting in a prolonged\nperiod of relatively poor economic performance, and an extended episode of policy rates at the\neffective lower bound. The implications for the banking system are important to consider.\nMany bank stress tests, such as those conducted in the U.S., do not capture the effects of\nprolonged economic underperformance on banks, as the tests often consider a span of only a\ncouple years (in the U.S., nine quarters). If the tests underestimate the full impact of sluggish\nrecoveries in a low rate environment, they might correspondingly indicate capital buffers that are\ninsufficient to protect banks against losses.3\nFigure 4 shows the path of three capital ratios for U.S. Global Systemically Important\nBank Holding Companies, or GSIBs. Equity capital to total assets and the tier 1 leverage ratio\nboth leveled off in early 2016 and have declined somewhat since then. The common equity tier\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n1 risk-based capital ratio is now modestly higher than in 2016. It’s worth recalling the equity\ncapital and tier 1 leverage ratios were focal points for many investors during the financial crisis.\nThe recent declines in these key capital ratios raise the question of whether the level of capital\nrepresents an adequate and appropriate buffer, if a low interest rate, constrained monetary policy\nenvironment continues.\nFigure 5 shows the profitability of the largest banks in the United States, the Euro Area,\nand Japan. In both the Euro Area and Japan, the challenging macroeconomic environment has\nresulted in very depressed interest rates. In the U.S., which is no longer at the effective lower\nbound, the macroeconomic environment has been more favorable. Differences in bank\nprofitability reflect, in part, the impact of these macroeconomic differences. In an environment\nof a hypothetical global recession, it is unlikely that the profit opportunities would be any better\n– in fact, the loan losses could provide a very challenging environment.\nWith capital ratios in the U.S. leveling off – and in some instances falling – and\nprofitability depressed in certain regions, it is important to ask whether the financial system is\nprepared for a hypothetical global economic downturn. In addressing that question, it is\ninteresting to consider banks’ payout ratios, as shown in Figure 6. In the United States, even as\ndividends have been increasing, share repurchases have also been accelerating, resulting in quite\nhigh payout ratios (specifically, dividends and repurchases as a share of net income). If the\nstress test no longer requires U.S. banks to pre-fund dividends and share buybacks – that is, if\nbanks are no longer required to meet capital ratios after payouts in stress conditions – one can\nexpect payout ratios to rise further, dissipating the volume of capital that would be available to\nensure solvency.4\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne way to avoid such a difficult operating environment for banks is to activate the\nCountercyclical Capital Buffers (CCyB).5 By increasing capital requirements during an\neconomic expansion, the CCyB would put banks in a better position to handle an economic\ndownturn in an era in which monetary policy buffers are limited. Hopefully, better-capitalized\nbanks would help compensate for limited monetary and fiscal policy buffers.\nFigure 7 shows the CCyBs currently in effect and announced by jurisdiction.6 There is\noften a long transition period between the announcement of a Countercyclical Capital Buffer\nchange and its implementation. The chart shows that many countries have increased their\nCCyBs, and some are planning further increases. In the U.S., in sharp contrast, the CCyB\nremains at zero.\nIn my view, proposals that would substitute CCyBs for capital adequacy buffers could\nhave undesirable effects. 7 Although the CCyB could provide an offset for the lack of monetary\npolicy buffer in a low interest rate environment, banks would likely be undercapitalized at the\ntrough of the economic downturn once the CCyB has been reduced – due to the lower capital\nrequirements going into a recession.\nIn the last recession, banks were unwilling to stop dividend payouts in a proactive way.\nThis is not surprising; no bank wants to signal it is in distress, but this potential reputational risk\nresults in banks being slow to retain needed capital. Regulatory stress tests can help by requiring\nall banks to be able to fund dividends and share buybacks in stressed situations. Given the likely\ninability of banks to raise funds sufficient to pre-fund high dividend payouts, this would likely\nresult in most banks reducing payouts to meet the regulatory pre-funding requirement as their\ncapital is eroded.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIndeed, Figure 8 examines the 2007-2010 period and compares cumulative cash\ndividends paid on common stock by the largest banks to the capital infusions they received\nthrough the Capital Purchase Program. The chart illustrates that roughly half of the capital\ninfusions into the largest banks during the financial crisis could have been avoided with a more\nproactive reduction in dividend payouts as economic problems arose.\nThere is little reason to believe that banks will be more proactive in the next crisis if they\nare no longer required to pre-fund payouts as a means of managing the risk attending stressed\nconditions. I also see the historical record arguing against the recently proposed change to no\nlonger require pre-funding of payout amounts.\nIn summary, I am not sure that recent developments and proposals in bank regulation\nproperly reflect the risks we are likely to face in a low interest rate environment that challenges\nbank profitability and provides less by way of monetary policy buffers. Specifically, capital\nbuffers should be rising now so that there is more room for them to decline if the economy\nfalters. While this is true for the United States, it may be even more true in Japan and Europe.\n\nLeverage in the Corporate Sector\nIn a low interest rate environment with robust capital market conditions, corporations are\nincented to take on more leverage. And leverage potentially amplifies the economic problems\nthat arise in a downturn.8 Outside the U.S., in some jurisdictions, there are more opportunities\nfor regulators to influence or limit excessive leverage. I believe U.S. policymakers would do\nwell to explore ways that policies could be used to prevent the buildup of leverage in a low-rate\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nenvironment, hopefully reducing the macroeconomic spillover that could result from overlevered households and firms.\nFigure 9 shows the ratio of nonfinancial corporate business debt to GDP in the U.S. This\nratio now exceeds its peak prior to the last recession and is at an all-time high for the series. As\nworrisome as this level of debt is, as the financial crisis highlighted, the distribution of risks to\nleverage across types of borrowers may be as important as the level of leverage itself.\nFigure 10 shows the share of investment grade bonds rated BBB, the lowest rating that\nstill qualifies as investment grade. Prior to the past two recessions, the share of BBB-rated\ninvestment-grade bonds was much lower, and then increased significantly during and following\nthe recession. In those episodes, the rising share of BBB-rated debt initially reflected, in part,\ndowngrades of what were formerly higher-rated securities. However, as this long recovery has\nprogressed, the share of BBB securities has instead risen steadily, as firms have chosen to issue\nsignificant quantities of debt securities.\nFigure 11 shows the share of loan issuances with high leverage, used here to refer to six\nor more times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). While\nthe share of highly leveraged loans out of total loans has increased significantly since 2010, the\nshare of highly leveraged loans used to finance leveraged buyouts has risen even more\ndramatically. In the United States, guidance – including the leveraged loan guidance – is not\nitself legally enforceable on banks. In addition, unlike in other countries where regulators may\nlimit leveraged lending for financial stability reasons, the suite of macroprudential tools is more\nlimited in the U.S. and U.S. bank regulators have sought to address banks’ provision of\nleveraged loans through consideration of safety and soundness of the individual banks. As a\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nresult, we see that the low interest rate environment, and the global willingness to “reach for\nyield,” have provided a ready market for corporations issuing highly leveraged loans.\nThus, corporations are not only becoming more leveraged relative to GDP, but the\ndistribution of credits is much more skewed towards the riskier credits than in the past. In sum,\none implication of this low interest rate environment has been that it appears to have encouraged\nlenders to look for higher-risk and higher-return loans. That desire has been met by a ready\nmarket for corporations willing to fund themselves with this riskier debt. Unfortunately, this\nstate of affairs is likely to lead to more corporations being in financial distress – or even being in\nbankruptcy – in a hypothetical recession because they are no longer able to service their high\ndebt levels. Greater corporate losses in a downturn, in turn, will exacerbate the negative\noutcomes relative to those that would have occurred with a less risky state of leverage. The\nlimited monetary policy buffers available magnify the problem. So I consider it important to ask\nwhether such high leverage, and the potential collateral damage it may cause in a downturn,\nrequires more significant public policy responses.\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile a low interest rate environment has implications for the sufficiency of monetary\npolicy buffers – a topic of the current monetary policy framework discussion in the United States\n– it also has implications for regulatory policies and financial stability policies. A low interest\nrate environment is likely to depress bank profits and, separately, make monetary policy less able\nto offset shocks. This combination suggests a higher capital buffer is required now than what\nwould be needed in a higher interest rate environment, so that capital ratios will have more room\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n8:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time (2:15 P.M. Norway Time) on Monday, November 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nto decline during a downturn. At least to date, it is my view that capital regulations may not\nfully reflect this increased risk.\nSimilarly, financial stability concerns stemming from leverage in the economy may\nrequire some rethinking in a low interest rate environment. To date, in the U.S. there is no\ncomprehensive way for public policy to address the incentives to increase corporate or household\nleverage in a low interest rate environment. There is, however, more latitude to influence\nleverage in some other countries.\nIn sum, I would suggest that the potential costs of the excessive leverage that arise in a\nlow interest rate environment deserve more research and, I suspect, more focused and proactive\npolicy actions.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm\n\nFor additional discussion, see April 18, 2018 remarks by Eric S.

Eastern Time)\non Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Exploring Economic Conditions and the\nImplications for Monetary Policy”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAmerican Economic Challenges Symposium,\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nMadison, Wisconsin\nOctober 11, 2019\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood Afternoon. It is wonderful to be back on campus at the University of WisconsinMadison. I appreciate the opportunity to take part in today’s American Economic Challenges\nSymposium, and congratulate the Department of Economics and the Juli Plant Grainger Institute\nfor Economic Research on putting together such a terrific program. I am pleased to be able to\nspeak with you today about the current state of the economy, and the implications for monetary\npolicy and interest rates.\nLast Friday, we all noted with interest the publication of the September employment\nreport from the U.S. Department of Labor.1 Interpretation of the report seems to have varied,\ndepending on the observer. To those concerned with and focused on risks to the economic\noutlook, the payroll-employment number of 136,000 – which is slower growth than earlier this\nyear – as well as the weakness in the manufacturing sector, supported the narrative that tariffs\nand weakness globally are slowing down the domestic economy. However, others noted that the\npreceding months were revised a bit higher, the unemployment rate had declined to 3.5 percent –\na nearly 50-year low – and that slower employment growth may instead reflect an economy\ngrowing beyond capacity and facing hiring constraints associated with a very tight labor market.\nMy own view is that the September employment report highlights trends we have been\nseeing since the spring: the presence of elevated downside risks, but actual economic outcomes\nthat are not much different than what most forecasters expected six months ago or longer.\nTo be sure, the economy faces a number of downside risks. In an already slowing global\neconomy, the imposition of tariffs and the prospect of additional tariffs are together resulting in\nslower exports and weakness in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Indeed, the highfrequency incoming economic data have been consistent with a slowdown that is largely\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconcentrated in manufacturing – which has reduced business fixed investment, as firms wrestle\nwith the implications of higher trade barriers. In addition, geopolitical concerns remain elevated.\nThe recent attack on Saudi oil production and the potential for a difficult Brexit, in a Europe that\nis already growing slowly, highlight that the global recovery faces risks that make it somewhat\nfragile.\nDespite these clear risks, second-quarter U.S. economic growth was above the estimated\n“potential” rate (that is, an estimate of the economy’s maximum sustainable output over the long\nterm).2 Looking forward, Fed policymakers’ September Summary of Economic Projections\n(SEP) and the consensus of private forecasters both anticipate growth around potential.\nHow can the economy continue to expand at potential with the sort of weakening in\nexports and investment that we are seeing? To date, the answer has been strong consumer\nspending. The U.S. consumer has been bolstered by plentiful jobs in tight labor markets, strong\ngrowth in personal income, and increases in household wealth due to rising prices of assets like\nstocks and homes. An important question remains whether consumption can continue to offset\nthe negative effects of trade problems and slower foreign growth.\nWhile U.S. consumers have been resilient to date, continued resilience is not guaranteed.\nSo it is important to consider whether the economy can continue on its quite favorable path –\nwith growth around potential, tight labor markets, and inflation near the Fed’s target of 2 percent.\nThe stance of monetary policy is already accommodative, so my view is that policymakers can\nbe patient and continue to evaluate incoming data before taking additional action. My forecast\nfor the economy does not envision additional easing being necessary. However, should risks\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmaterialize and economic growth slow materially, to below the potential rate, I would be\nprepared to support aggressive easing.\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nFigure 1 provides the median forecast of Fed policymakers for key economic variables\nfrom the SEPs from March and September 2019. How different are the forecasts of economic\noutcomes in September, compared with what we anticipated before the recent increase in tariffs\nand the cuts in the federal funds rate? What is striking to me is how little the forecasts for 2019\nhave changed.\nOf course, this is due in part to the significant easing actions that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has already put in place, which will continue to stimulate the\neconomy this year and next. More recently, Fed policymakers have added a couple of interest\nrate cuts to the mix. These actions, to some extent, help to keep the forecast in the healthy zone.\nInterestingly, the forecast for real GDP growth for 2019 has actually increased over this\nperiod, though only by 0.1 percentage point. In March and September, the median forecast for\nthe unemployment rate at the end of this year was 3.7 percent, an unemployment rate that looks\ntoo pessimistic now, given the September employment report’s reading of 3.5 percent. While\ntotal and core PCE inflation are lower than had been expected, core PCE inflation (which\nremoves the often-volatile food and energy prices) has risen 0.3 percentage points from its lows\nearlier this year.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOverall, then, the economy has evolved about as expected, despite the unanticipated\nincrease in tariffs and the slower growth of exports and business fixed investment. Moreover,\nrecent monetary policy easing is likely to provide some stimulus over the next several quarters.\nNot only has the economy evolved about as expected, but it is currently close to where\npolicymakers had hoped it would be at this time. Figure 2 shows the recent paths for some\nalternative measures of inflation. The dashed line indicates the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target.\nThree different measures of inflation are shown on the chart. On a 12-month basis, core CPI is\ncurrently at 2.4 percent. Core CPI has risen over the past several months, settling at 2.4 percent\nfor August and September. The Dallas Trimmed Mean, which removes extreme observations,\nrounds to 2 percent. Core PCE is at 1.8 percent, slightly below the Fed’s target – but has also\ntrended up recently. With tight labor markets and an already accommodative stance of policy, it\nseems likely that inflation will remain close to target as long as the economy does not\nunexpectedly slow down.\nFigure 3 provides the Committee’s most recent estimate of full employment (the dashed\nline) at 4.2 percent. While the level of unemployment associated with full employment is\ndifficult to estimate, and the FOMC has lowered its median estimate of full employment over the\npast several years, we see that the September unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is well below\npolicymakers’ best current estimate of full employment.\nIn sum, the U.S. economy is now very close to meeting the Fed’s Congressional mandate\nof full employment and stable prices (which we define as 2 percent inflation). In addition, I\nwould note that the Committee’s September median forecast for 2019 real GDP growth was 2.2\npercent, consistent with no significant slowdown in the second half of this year. So as we look at\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neconomic performance, forecasts, and risks to the forecasts, the overriding policy question is\nwhether the risks are so elevated that further easing is required, despite already accommodative\npolicy.\n\nFinancial Considerations\nCertainly, one reason for concern about the economic outlook is the movement of the 10year U.S. Treasury yield. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has declined significantly,\nleading many financial market participants to express concern that this signals a more significant\nimpending slowdown. An alternative explanation that I have discussed in recent talks is that\nvery low (and in some cases negative) long-term foreign rates are playing a role in pushing down\nU.S. long rates, as foreign investors move money from low-rate economies into the (relatively)\nhigh-rate U.S. markets, pushing down U.S. yields.3 Also, it seems like global investors are using\nU.S. Treasuries to partially hedge against the possibility of an economic downturn in their\ncountry or region, since the prices of long-duration U.S. Treasury securities normally rise during\neconomic downturns. I see both of these as more likely explanations of the recent movements\nthan an impending U.S. slowdown.\nOther financial indicators do not portend a significant slowdown. Despite high leverage\nin the corporate sector and more issuance at the bottom end of investment-grade ratings, the\nspread between yields on corporate bonds and Treasury bonds, shown in Figure 5, remains\nbelow the average spread of the past 25 years. Similarly, the stock market, shown in Figure 6,\nremains close to all-time highs.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecent developments in oil markets are more consistent with apparent risks to the global\neconomy. As shown in Figure 7, oil prices have fallen – usually a sign that investors see\nadditional weakness developing in the global economy – despite the supply disruption caused by\nthe attack on Saudi oil production. The dollar has continued to appreciate against various\ncurrencies, and relative to the pound – as Brexit concerns remain elevated – which is shown in\nFigure 8. And Figure 9 shows the continued impact of the trade war with China, as both\nexports to and imports from China have declined significantly.\n\nImplications of the Risks\nGiven that the economy is close to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate, should the risks\nthat are clearly present cause policymakers at the Fed to alter monetary policy? At this point in\nthe cycle, should risks be addressed preemptively, or should FOMC participants wait until they\nmaterialize?\nDespite the clear risks to the economic outlook, most professional private forecasters\nexpect the economy to continue to grow around its potential. Figure 10 provides the most recent\nBlue Chip forecast – a summary of the views of approximately 50 private forecasters -- for real\nGDP over the next several years on the left, as well as a comparison to the earlier March forecast\non the right. In the chart on the left, the solid line shows the average forecast for real GDP,\nwhich at about 1.7 percent is the same as my estimate of the potential growth of the economy.\nThe dashed lines reflect the average of the 10 lowest and 10 highest forecasts for real GDP.\nEven the lowest 10 forecasts still expect positive economic growth, though slower than my\nestimate of potential. The chart on the right compares the average of the 10 lowest from the\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncurrent forecast (the dark blue dashed line on both charts), with the average of the 10 lowest\nfrom the March forecast. The lowest forecasts have not become more pessimistic.\nWith both the Fed’s forecast and private forecasts expecting the economy to grow at\nclose to potential, the decision to ease further or keep rates as they are rests on how much\ninsurance to take out against the risks that I have outlined. To answer that question, one should\ntake into account how much insurance is already in place – that is, what is the current stance of\nmonetary policy? Figure 11 shows the federal funds rate relative to the SEP estimate of what\nthe federal funds rate will be in the long run – roughly speaking, the interest rate that FOMC\nmembers believe is neither stimulative nor contractionary, other things equal. The median\nestimate of the long-run federal funds rate is 2.5 percent. The target for the federal funds rate\nwas set by the FOMC at a range of 1.75 to 2.0 percent at its most recent meeting, after two onequarter-percentage point reductions in the rate in July and September of this year. In short, the\ncurrent level of the federal funds rate is already below the FOMC’s estimate of the long-run rate.\nIn sum, monetary policy is already accommodative. This is especially notable given that\nthe average forecaster expects growth close to potential, with already-tight labor markets. But\nnote, too, that Figure 11 shows the funds rate is not that far from zero, which suggests the Fed, at\ncurrent rates, has limited scope to lower rates in the event of a downturn. That limited policy\nspace – which some see as reason to “keep powder dry,” and others as reason to act early –\nshould also figure into the Fed’s determination of appropriate policy today.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\n12:35 P.M. U.S. Central Time (1:35 P.M. Eastern Time) on Friday, October 11, 2019 - OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that after two recent rate easings of 25 basis\npoints each, monetary policy is already accommodative. Sustaining growth at potential depends\non the U.S. consumer continuing to offset the weakness we are seeing in exports and business\nfixed investment. To me, it seems appropriate to continue to closely monitor incoming data to\ndetermine if the forecast of growth around potential is likely to be achieved, or if the risks I have\noutlined are indeed materializing.\nWhile the risks to the global and U.S. economies remain, there are also risks to easing too\naggressively, as I’ve highlighted in previous speeches. Ever-lower interest rates could encourage\nreaching-for-yield behavior at exactly the wrong stage of the economic cycle. This remains an\nimportant consideration factoring into my views on the elements policymakers must weigh and\nbalance at this complex time for our economy.\nThank you for having me back to Madison.\n\n1\n\nFor more, see Employment Situation Summary, released Oct. 4, 2019.\n\nFor context on the estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, see the Congressional Budget Office, for\nexample https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53558.\n2\n\nFor additional discussion, see: Rosengren, Eric: “Weighing the Risks to the Economic Outlook,” Sept. 3, 2019, and\n“Assessing Economic Conditions and Risks to Financial Stability,” Sept. 20, 2019.\n3\n\n8\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nCredit Suisse Asian Investment Conference\n\nHong Kong, China\nMarch 26, 2019\n\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be in Hong Kong for the Credit Suisse Asian\nInvestment Conference.\nMy colleagues and I spend a fair amount of time talking to members of the public about\nthe economic analysis that goes into monetary policymaking. We spend somewhat less time\ntalking about the tools we will use to attain our economic goals. And to date we have spent\nrelatively little time speaking in detail about one of those tools, the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet – that is, the assets the U.S. central bank is holding and liabilities and capital used to\nfinance those assets.1 It is an admittedly complicated topic, but one that needs more explanation.\nThe balance sheet needs to be better understood – beyond just its total size, and beyond just the\nassets on it. I say this given its likely importance in the future, should there eventually be an\neconomic downturn; and given the suggestion in some quarters that balance sheet policies are\nbehind recent market volatility (a suggestion I disagree with).\nTechnically speaking, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, like that of any enterprise,\nreflects a point-in-time financial snapshot. The balance sheet is always evolving, and as a result\nthe Federal Reserve publishes it each week.2 I would point out that last week the Fed released\nadditional information regarding its plans and principles for balance sheet normalization.3\nThroughout my remarks today, I will be highlighting the importance of the balance sheet\nas a tool that will likely need to be used by central banks around the world, given the low interest\nrate environments in many developed countries. I will touch on some of the misconceptions that\nhave emerged around the topic, look in some detail at the actual composition of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet, discuss the Fed’s balance sheet normalization approach, disprove some mistaken\nassumptions about the balance sheet and recent financial market turbulence, and comment on the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrole of the balance sheet going forward – providing my own view of the role balance sheet\npolicies and actions could play in the future.\n\nMisconceptions about the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet policies of the U.S. central bank have received rather significant\nattention over the past two quarters. That attention stands in contrast to the somewhat surprising\nlack of market reaction in September 2017 to the announcement of a very gradual runoff of\nFederal Reserve assets.4\nEven more surprising to me was the association – made by some market analysts at the\nend of 2018 – that the increased market volatility, falling long-term interest rates, and declining\nglobal stock market prices in the fourth quarter could be attributed to Federal Reserve balance\nsheet actions. In actuality, the runoff in balance sheet assets continued at a little faster pace in\nthe first two months of this year than in the fourth quarter of last year, yet markets have risen and\nvolatility has declined – which certainly does not square with the earlier commentary. This\nepisode highlights the reason for concern that some misconceptions have emerged about the\neffects of Federal Reserve balance sheet actions – and what such actions can, and cannot,\nachieve.\nI have talked to a variety of market observers who argue that the Fed’s balance sheet\nshould return to levels similar to those that existed prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The\nargument for such a policy is based more on misconception than fact, since it does not recognize\nthat factors unrelated to monetary policy also impact the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet, as I will demonstrate in a moment. Furthermore, I think it is a mistake to focus primarily\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\non the size of the balance sheet, with much less attention placed on the quantity of bank reserves\nand the duration of the assets being held. In my view, these latter aspects are much more\nimportant than overall size, from a policy perspective.\nIt is important to dispel misconceptions surrounding central bank balance sheets if for no\nother reason than this: It is quite likely that central bank balance sheets will be integral to the\nconduct of monetary policy in the future, in the U.S. and many other countries. When a\nrecession eventually occurs, central banks would normally decrease short-term interest rates.\nBut with interest rates already low in most developed countries, central banks would likely reach\nthe effective lower bound quite quickly. In fact, in Japan and Europe it is theoretically possible\nthat rates might not rise much above the effective lower bound before a hypothetical next\nrecession occurs. As in the Great Recession that followed the financial crisis, this could force\ncentral bankers to use asset purchases to create more accommodative financial conditions and\nstimulate their economies, which would necessarily entail an expansion of their balance sheets.5\nIf balance sheet policies are to become a more regular feature of monetary policy actions\naround the world, my view is that it is important that central bankers are clear with the public\nabout why they would pursue such policies, what effects they will have, and what complications\nmight arise as a consequence of using such policies.\nAllow me to outline the key points that I will explore in more detail today. First, part of\nthe expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet occurs as a normal consequence of a\ngrowing economy with a growing need for currency, a factor not related to monetary policy\naction. A second factor that is unrelated to monetary policy is changes in the balances held at the\nFed by the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury’s General Account has grown significantly following\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe financial crisis, in part because the Treasury shifted from using accounts at commercial banks\nto the Treasury General Account and decided to maintain larger balances.6,7 As a consequence\nof these factors, returning the balance sheet to a pre-crisis size may sound like the end result of\nnormalizing policy, but in fact is neither desirable nor feasible. In addition, demand for reserves\nis much greater than pre-crisis, in part because financial institutions see the benefits of having a\nhigher level of liquid assets.\nSecond, when scaled relative to GDP, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is actually\nsmall compared to those of central banks in many other developed countries.\nAnd third, as suggested by the previous discussion of currency and Treasury balances, it\nis important to focus on aspects of the central bank balance sheet that policymakers directly\ncontrol, and that are closely related to policy decisions. I have in mind bank reserves, which can\ndirectly affect the ability to control short-term interest rates, and the duration of assets, which can\nalso play a role in policymakers’ ability to lower longer-term interest rates, as I will discuss in a\nmoment.\nAs you likely know, the Federal Reserve has announced that it will continue using the\nsame monetary policy framework that it has since the financial crisis, which maintains an ample\nsupply of reserves to ensure that it can effectively maintain a “floor” type system for controlling\nshort-term interest rates via administered rates.8 I will describe this in more detail in a moment.\nIn particular, variability in some of the components of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet make\nit necessary to have ample reserves as a reasonable buffer if policymakers seek to avoid\nsignificant volatility in short-term interest rates.9\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFinally, in my view, monetary policymakers should give more consideration to\nstructuring the balance sheet to provide more leeway for policy measures to be taken when the\nnext economic downturn occurs. This consideration primarily centers on building in the\nflexibility to exchange short-term for long-term Treasury securities so as to lower longer-term\nTreasury rates. I will now discuss all these points in more detail.\n\nExamining the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nAs I mentioned at the outset, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, like that of any\nenterprise, reflects at a single point in time the assets it holds, and the liabilities and capital used\nto finance those assets.\nFigure 1 shows how the assets and liabilities of the Fed have changed since before the\nGreat Recession. The table provides a high-level overview of the largest categories of assets and\nliabilities of the Federal Reserve, for January 2004 and for February 2019. The assets are\ncomposed primarily of U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities that have a\ngovernment guarantee. All of these securities accrue interest.\nThese interest-generating assets are financed primarily by three categories of liabilities:\nFederal Reserve notes – U.S. currency – a category that does not pay interest; deposits held for\nthe Treasury; and reserves held for thousands of depository institutions, which pay an overnight\nrate – or interest on reserves.10 I would note that the net income generated by the Fed’s balance\nsheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury annually.11\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs Figure 1 illustrates, there have been significant changes to the assets and liabilities of\nthe Federal Reserve over the past 15 years. In terms of assets, in 2004 the Federal Reserve held\nroughly one-third of its securities as short-term Treasury bills and held no mortgage-backed\nsecurities. By 2019, the Federal Reserve held essentially no Treasury bills and had dramatically\nincreased its holdings of long-term securities such as Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. This change in the composition of assets reflects a Fed policy choice that was\nnecessitated by the fact that the short-term policy rate was already at its effective lower bound,\neven as the economy remained quite weak. Hoping to stimulate the economy, the Fed purchased\nlong-term securities in order to reduce long-term interest rates (because debt security prices\nmove inversely with their interest rates, higher prices spurred by purchases reduced rates).\nIn principle, the Federal Reserve can move to longer-term assets either by exchanging\nthem for the central bank’s holdings of short-term assets on the Fed balance sheet (a reallocation\nof the portfolio, accomplished by selling short-term assets and purchasing longer-term assets) or\nby simply purchasing longer-term securities – that is, crediting the banks that the Fed purchases\nthem from with new reserves. In practice, the Fed did some of both. In the end, the overall\namount of assets the central bank held became much larger, growing from less than $1 trillion to\napproximately $4.5 trillion, in large part due to these policy-related purchases of long-term\nsecurities.\nWhile much of this growth was initially a result of intentional monetary policy actions\nand the operation of lending facilities set up to provide liquidity during the financial crisis, there\nwere also secular trends unrelated to Fed policy that caused the balance sheet to grow. These\ntrends primarily affected the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhat liabilities financed the growing assets on the Fed’s balance sheet? Before the\ncrisis, the largest category of Fed liabilities was currency holdings. Currency is held by domestic\nindividuals who use it as a medium of exchange, but is also held abroad. In some countries the\nU.S. dollar is the de facto domestic currency, whereas in other countries the U.S. dollar is often\nused as a store of value, hedging against the possibility of exchange rate depreciation of the local\ncurrency.\nThe Federal Reserve passively issues currency through banks in response to domestic and\ninternational demand for currency from bank customers. And when individuals hold U.S.\ncurrency, they are in effect providing an interest-free loan to the federal government.12\nAs Figure 2 shows, as of 2019, currency holdings were more than twice the size of the\nFed’s entire balance sheet in 2004. It is important to note that this particular driver of currency\nliabilities is not a monetary policy action by the Fed. Since 2004, currency has grown from\nunder $700 billion to $1.66 trillion. The change in currency holdings alone highlights that the\nFed’s balance sheet will not be able to shrink to earlier levels.\nOf course, Figure 2 also shows that in 2004, just under 90 percent of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet was financed by currency. And now that percentage is just over 40\npercent.\nAmong the non-currency liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet, “Other Liabilities” and the\n“U.S. Treasury General Account” are, like currency growth, not primarily driven by monetary\npolicy actions. The balance sheet would have needed to grow to accommodate these changes as\nwell. In short, those who argue for returning to a balance sheet closer to the former $1 trillion\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlevel from before the financial crisis are ignoring the non-monetary policy reasons that the\nbalance sheet has expanded.\nEven if one picks a much shorter horizon, significant changes in the composition of the\nFederal Reserve’s liabilities are evident, as shown in Figure 3. From September 2017 to\nFebruary 2019, Federal Reserve policymakers have very gradually reduced the overall balance\nsheet by letting some of the securities that are maturing roll off. However, this relatively small\nreduction on the asset side of the balance sheet has been accompanied by increases in both\ncurrency and the U.S. Treasury General Account on the liabilities side. The result has been an\neven larger shrinkage of reserves – a Fed liability – than would have occurred due to the rolling\noff alone.\nFigure 4 shows the overall size of the balance sheet compared to the amount of excess\nreserves of depository institutions – the reserves in excess of the minimums required to meet\nreserve requirements.13 During the period when Federal Reserve policymakers were reinvesting\nmaturing securities and holding the balance sheet’s overall size relatively constant, excess\nreserves were declining because the other liabilities mentioned earlier were rising, absorbing\nreserves out of the banking system. With an enormous surplus of reserves already in the banking\nsystem, the Fed chose not to offset these reserve declines. As total assets have declined, and\nother liabilities have continued to grow, excess reserves are declining more rapidly than the\noverall balance sheet.\nFigure 5 shows central banks’ balance sheets relative to GDP in major industrialized\ncountries. Examining the central bank’s balance sheet assets as a share of GDP shows that the\nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet, relative to the size of its economy, is smaller than that of these\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nother major developed countries. This is despite the fact that as a reserve currency, international\ndemand for U.S. currency will be considerably larger than is the case for other currencies.\nAnother reason the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is smaller as a share of GDP than other\ndeveloped countries’ balance sheets stems from the aggressive and proactive easing by the Fed\nduring the financial crisis, which restored U.S. growth faster than otherwise.14 I would assert\nthat partly as a result of that aggressive action, the Fed was able to move sooner to unwind its\nemergency monetary policies and the United States is further along in the balance sheet\nnormalization process relative to many peers.\nOverall, these facts suggest that the balance sheet should not be expected to decline to\nanything close to the pre-crisis size, in my view. Growth in non-monetary policy related\nliabilities, like currency, make it quite likely that the absolute size of the Fed’s balance sheet will\ncontinue to grow.\nHowever, the size of the balance sheet — more specifically, the size of reserve balances\nin the banking system — is also closely related to how the central bank chooses to conduct\nmonetary policy, and how we want monetary policy to react in the next recession. I will now\nexplore these aspects of the balance sheet with you.\n\nBalance Sheet Normalization\nFollowing its January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S.\nmonetary policy decision-making body, issued a short statement regarding monetary policy\nimplementation and balance sheet normalization.15 The Committee said:\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in\nwhich an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal\nfunds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the\nsetting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not required.\n\nTwo aspects of the announcement are particularly notable as we consider the future size\nof the Fed’s balance sheet.\nFirst, the FOMC indicated that the Federal Reserve would continue to operate in an\nenvironment of an “ample” supply of reserves, which implies a floor-type system of interest rate\ncontrol, consistent with the operating framework used since the fall of 2008. Prior to the\nfinancial crisis, the Federal Reserve operated in a “scarcity of reserves” monetary policy\nframework. That meant simply that there were enough reserves in the banking system to satisfy\nshort-term borrowing and lending needs, but not more. As a consequence, to maintain the\ntargeted level for short-term interest rates, the Fed regularly conducted open-market operations\nby adjusting the supply of reserves (and thus the federal funds interest rate), given its estimate of\nreserves demand.\nBut once short-term rates had hit zero and the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases had\ndramatically expanded the supply of excess reserves, it could no longer set short-term rates by\nmaking small adjustments to the supply of reserves. There were just too many reserves to do\nthat. So the Federal Reserve moved to a “floor system” where we rely on a key administered\ninterest rate that we can set regardless of reserve levels: the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves.\nIn theory, this rate will establish a floor below which market rates will not fall (since banking\ninstitutions would generally not lend out short-term money at a rate less than the rate the Fed\npays risk-free on banks’ excess reserves). The announcement that the Fed is continuing with the\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfloor system implies that we intend to maintain an ample supply of reserves at depository\ninstitutions.\nA second implication of the announcement was that within the context of an ample\nsupply of reserves, intervention to add or reduce reserves to offset other liability movements is\nnot necessary (thus the phrase, “active management of the supply of reserves is not required.”)\nIn this operating model, excess reserves need to be ample enough that surprise movements in\nother liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet do not need to be offset through open market\noperations.\nFigure 6 shows the major liability categories over the past 15 years. While currency\ndemand has increased quite smoothly overall, liabilities like the U.S. Treasury General Account\nand Other Liabilities have shown significant fluctuations. To avoid regular interventions to\nreduce short-term interest rate volatility, reserves need to be large enough that large, temporary\ndeclines or surges in liabilities do not cause short-term rates to spike or plummet. With ample\nreserves, fluctuations in other liabilities do not need to be offset.\n\nThe Balance Sheet and Recent Financial Market Turbulence\nSome market analysts attribute turbulence in financial markets during the fourth quarter\nof 2018 to the Federal Reserve’s continuing reduction of the size of its balance sheet. In my\nview, however, concerns about the international economy, potential trade disputes, and a U.S.\ngovernment shutdown are much more plausible explanations for the financial market turbulence.\nFor one thing, the Fed’s reduction is still quite gradual. And equity markets experienced a\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsubstantial recovery in the first two months of 2019, even while the runoff of the balance sheet\nwas slightly faster than in the fourth quarter.\nFigure 7 shows the monthly change in the Federal Reserve System assets. By design, the\nrunoff was intended to be quite gradual. The runoffs during the third and fourth quarters of 2018\nwere similar, with an average monthly decline of 0.9 percent in both periods. A similar decline\noccurred in January 2019, with a more rapid decline following in February 2019. Despite the\nroughly similar magnitude of runoff, the stock market rose over the third quarter while falling in\nthe fourth quarter of last year and recovering again since the beginning of this year. So there\nseems to be little correlation between equity market movements and the relatively small and\nsteady decline in the balance sheet.\nLooking at another financial indicator – the behavior of term premia – also argues against\nthe idea that the reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet spurred market turbulence. Conceptually,\nquantitative easing should work through the term premium, or the return needed to induce\ninvestors to hold long-term securities instead of short-term securities. Term premia from 2004 to\nearly 2019 are shown in Figure 8. As the Fed purchases long-term securities, it raises the price\nand lowers the rate on those securities, thus reducing the term premium. This also encourages\ninvestors to “bid up” the price and lower the interest rates on other high-duration securities, so\nthat the Fed’s purchases of government-guaranteed securities have beneficial spillover effects to\na wide array of other asset prices.\nWith quantitative tightening, one would expect over time that Treasury yields and term\npremia would move higher. In contrast, last December the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate fell and\nthe term premium remained quite low – not the reaction one would expect if the very gradual\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreduction in the balance sheet were responsible for substantial tightening, which caused asset\nprices to fall.\n\nThe Balance Sheet Going Forward\nBoth the composition and size of the central bank’s balance sheet can influence financial\nconditions, and thus the path of the economy. As I discussed earlier, holding the balance sheet’s\nsize constant would still reduce the amount of excess reserves, as liabilities – such as currency –\ngrow over time. While the point at which the balance sheet no longer is being reduced is clearly\nimportant, another significant issue going forward will be determining the point at which the\nFederal Reserve should once again begin purchasing securities to offset the decline in reserves\n(and the size of its balance sheet) that would otherwise occur as currency and other liabilities\ngrow.\nAnother key issue will be the composition of the balance sheet and the duration of the\nassets on it. Figure 9 shows that the Fed has been very gradually reducing the duration of U.S.\nTreasury securities holdings on its balance sheet. Even so, the duration is far higher than it was\nprior to the financial crisis. One reason for this rise in duration is shown in Figure 10. The Fed\ncurrently holds virtually no U.S. Treasury bills, which had been more than one-third of the Fed’s\nsecurities holdings prior to the financial crisis.\nIn my view, one benefit of having both short- and long-maturity Treasuries on the Fed\nbalance sheet is that it provides a way to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing\nwithout increasing the size of the balance sheet, should that be necessary. As suggested earlier,\npolicymakers could lower longer-term interest rates by selling Treasury bills and buying long14\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nterm Treasuries, leaving the size of the balance sheet constant. But to do so, the Fed needs to\nhave some Treasury bills on the balance sheet. Thus, increasing the share of U.S. Treasury bills\nand more quickly lowering the duration of securities held as assets may be an important goal as\npart of the normalization process. This would give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to take the\npolicy step of lengthening the maturity of its balance sheet assets the next time a significant\neconomic downturn occurs.\n\nConcluding Observations\nActive use of the central bank’s balance sheet is a relatively new tool for monetary\npolicy. As an emerging part of the monetary policy toolkit, altering the size and composition of\nthe central bank’s balance sheet does not yet have a long history of careful analysis of its effects.\nIn fact, most central banks still see moving short-term interest rates as the primary tool to\ninfluence the economy. However, I think it is important to understand how balance sheet\nchanges can and do impact the economy.\nIn summary, it is unrealistic to expect the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to return to the\nsize it was before the financial crisis, for several reasons that I have described today. First, the\ndemand for some of the Fed’s liabilities – for instance currency – continues to grow, which given\nthe binding characteristics of a balance sheet implies the purchase of additional assets over\ntime.16,17 A second reason is that operating frameworks affect the desired size and composition\nof the balance sheet. At the January 2019 FOMC meeting, the Committee announced plans to\ncontinue running a floor system with an abundance of reserves. A “scarcity of reserves”\nframework like the Fed operated with before the financial crisis would have a smaller pool of\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreserves and a smaller balance sheet than a floor system with an abundance of reserves. Third,\nsome of the liability categories have become more variable, and if policymakers want to avoid\nregular interventions in the financial market, it requires that there be enough excess reserves that\nthese fluctuations in liability categories do not create additional volatility in short-term rates.\nAs I mentioned today, some have suggested that the Fed’s balance sheet is partly\nresponsible for financial market volatility at the end of 2018, but I disagree. The Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet decline has been quite gradual, and proceeded along roughly the same\npath when stock prices have been rising as when stock prices have been falling. Furthermore, I\nnoted that the term premium, the main mechanism by which the balance sheet impacts the\neconomy, remains at quite low levels.\nIn conclusion, I will say that in a hypothetical next recession, it may be that many central\nbanks have little room to reduce short-term rates. This will likely generate an increased need to\nutilize the balance sheet as a stimulative tool of monetary policy. Therefore, it is important for\npolicymakers to continue to research how balance sheet operations influence the economy – and\nI dare say it is important for market observers, lawmakers, and the public to become more\ncomfortable with the benefits of central banks using their balance sheet tools to pursue the public\ninterest.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, the discussion of balance sheets in Corporate Finance by Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe.\n\n2\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm.\n\n16\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 P.M. on Monday, March 25, 2019, U.S. Eastern Time,\nwhich is 8:30 A.M. on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 in Hong Kong – OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n3\n\nSee the March 20, 2019 statement Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320c.htm.\n4\n\nAfter the September 2017 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the program for gradually reducing the Federal\nReserve’s securities holdings would begin in October 2017.\n5\n\nSpecifically, such actions would likely entail an expansion of reserves, which, along with the normal and gradual\nincrease in currency requirements, would significantly swell the size of central bank balance sheets.\n6\n\nSee Chicago Fed Letter, No. 395, 2018, The Structure of Federal Reserve Liabilities, by Thomas Haasl, Sam\nSchulhofer-Wohl, and Anna Paulson: https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2018/395.\n7\n\nThis is done to cover payments in the event that the Treasury is unable to issue debt.\n\n8\n\nAfter the January 2019 FOMC meeting, it was announced that the operating regime would continue to be a floor\nsystem. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.\n9\n\nIf the Fed shrinks available reserves too much, then fluctuations in reserves due to factors beyond our control—\nsuch as the Treasury’s deposits to and withdrawals from its Fed account—could lead to a scarcity or surplus of\nreserves that would in turn cause significant volatility in short-term interest rates. Knowing how large is an “ample”\nsupply is something we are learning about; but as I have outlined, it is essential to keep an ample supply if we are to\ncontrol short-term interest rates as we have in recent years.\n10\n\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve the authorization to pay interest on reserves, effective October of 2008.\nPaying interest on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates – because banks can receive interest\non reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks will not want to lend at a rate below what they can get\nfrom holding funds with the Fed.\nThe net income generated by the Fed’s balance sheet activity is turned over to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\ncentral bank’s annual remittance of earnings net of expenses.\n11\n\nWhen banks purchase currency from the Fed, they “pay” for it with reserves, and thus their reserve balances\ndecrease. If the Fed wishes to offset this decline in reserves, the Fed can purchase government securities, which\nreplaces the reserves in the banking system, maintaining the overall level of reserves even as currency increases. If\nit does not, reserve balances in the banking system will decline as currency use increases. Those Treasury securities\nare assets on the Fed’s balance sheet. The interest earned by the Federal Reserve on these securities is ultimately\nreturned to the federal government.\n12\n\n13\n\nIt is important to note that there are other reasons for banks to hold reserves; for example, banks use reserves to\nmeet their liquidity requirements of holding high quality liquid assets.\n14\n\nIt is important to note the figure also shows that the other central banks have significantly expanded their balance\nsheets.\n15\n\nSee the January 30, 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet\nNormalization: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm\n16\n\nAs I demonstrated, currency is now much larger than the Federal Reserve’s entire pre-crisis balance sheet.\n\n17\n\nIf we intend to operate in an environment of ample reserves, policymakers will need to match increased currency\ndemand with increased Treasury holdings.\n\n17\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\n60th Annual Meeting\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today at the 60th annual meeting\nof the National Association for Business Economics. Let me also welcome you to our wonderful\ncity of Boston.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nLast week the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, a move consistent\nwith the very strong economic performance seen over the last two quarters. With this latest\nmonetary policy action, the federal funds rate has now been increased three times this year – and\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nat 2 to 2-1/4 percent, it is now above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent for the\nfirst time since the financial crisis and Great Recession.\nToday, U.S. monetary conditions remain mildly accommodative, with short-term market\nrates barely higher than the inflation rate (thus barely positive in real terms). And given tax cuts\nand spending realities, fiscal policy remains quite accommodative.\nGiven the accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy, it is not surprising that\nmost private forecasters, as well as most members of the FOMC, expect the economy to grow\nstrongly for the second half of this year. Many economists expect real growth for the second half\nof this year to be approximately 3 percent. That is strong enough to further tighten labor markets\nand further push down the unemployment rate, currently at 3.9 percent. Consistent with this\nexpectation, the Blue Chip forecasters anticipate the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent by\nthe end of next year.\nThis strong U.S. economic growth is occurring despite some clear risks to the global\neconomy, which I’ll touch on today. The announcement of increased tariffs by both the U.S. and\nChina last Monday heightened concerns that trade disruptions could become a significant\nheadwind over time. In addition, several emerging market economies are now more stressed –\nparticularly those such as Turkey, whose corporations’ U.S. dollar-denominated debts have\nbecome costlier as their currency has depreciated against the dollar. And while Europe has\nshown some signs of improving, there is still the possibility of more significant disruptions\nemerging from a potentially disruptive Brexit, or from the exposure of many European banks to\nsome of the troubled emerging market economies.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHow should U.S. monetary policymakers respond to these conditions – a strong U.S.\neconomy, but clear signs of rising risks emanating from other economies? I am carefully\nwatching factors that could pose risks to the continued U.S. economic expansion. But my own\nassessment is that the most likely outcome will be a U.S. labor market that continues to tighten\nand the likely buildup of economic imbalances, including, but not limited to, inflationary\npressures.\nWhile inflation remains well contained to date, pushing the economy too hard risks\ninflationary concerns or financial-stability risks. Either of these outcomes might necessitate a\nmore forceful monetary policy response. While a more forceful policy might be appropriate\nunder such conditions, it is not a risk-free strategy and could put at risk the continued expansion.\nThe history of rapid rate increases in the U.S. suggests that such a risk is real, and as a result my\npreference for a strategy that allows a continued, but gradual, pace of monetary tightening.\nAssuming the potential global risks I mentioned do not materialize and disrupt strong\nU.S. GDP growth, I believe that continuing to raise short-term rates gradually, until monetary\npolicy becomes mildly restrictive, is likely to be appropriate and beneficial over the long term.\n\nLabor Markets\nConditions in labor markets are, of course, foundational to my analysis. In every\ndiscussion I have with businesspeople in New England, a theme that continually comes up is the\ntightness of the labor market. Turning to the data, Figure 1 shows that the number of initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance is now near a series low and much lower than it has been\nduring all but one of the previous recoveries since 1967. It is not surprising that firms are not\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlaying people off, because the economy continues to be quite strong, but another factor is the\ndifficulty finding someone to replace a worker who is laid off or leaves. So layoffs may remain\nuncommon even if firms experience some slowdown in their business.\nFigure 2 shows the so-called “quits rate,” the number of people who voluntarily leave\ntheir job as a share of total employment, since 2003. Keep in mind that if you quit your job, you\ndo not qualify for unemployment insurance. So, essentially, the quits rate provides an indication\nof workers’ confidence in their ability to find a new job.\nFigure 3 shows the job openings rate – which is the number of job openings at the end of\nthe month, relative to total employment plus job openings, monthly since 2003. The job\nopenings rate is now significantly higher than at the peak before the crisis and recession. This\nmeasure of firms’ demand for labor is at its highest level since the series was first reported in late\n2000.\nFigure 4 shows the unemployment rate, which has fallen to 3.9 percent. The Blue Chip\nconsensus forecast expects it to fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year. Such an outcome\nwould be well below most estimates of the natural, or long-run, rate of unemployment. At\npresent, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that no FOMC\nparticipant estimates the long-run unemployment rate to be lower than 4 percent. The median\nlonger-run unemployment rate projected by FOMC participants is 4.5 percent. I would suggest\nthat a forecast where the unemployment rate falls well below its estimated long-run sustainable\nlevel for a significant period of time is a sign of macroeconomic imbalance, which poses a risk of\nrising inflation or increasing financial stability concerns – or both.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWages and Prices\nTurning to wages and prices, Figure 5 provides the average hourly earnings of\nproduction and nonsupervisory private-industry employees from January 2003 to August 2018.\nOver the past five years, earnings have gradually risen, and are currently roughly consistent with\nthe sum of 2 percent inflation, plus the somewhat subdued productivity gains of roughly 1\npercent.\nInterestingly, if you examine service-providing industries and goods-producing\nindustries, you see that earnings in both have been increasing. The service-providing industries’\nearnings closely match those of the total, while goods-producing industries (which include those\nthat are more export-intensive and thus more likely to be directly impacted by tariffs) have seen\nearnings increase more quickly of late – although I should note that the volatility of these\nearnings is always higher than that of services. Should the upward trend in wages continue, one\nwould expect firms to either shrink their profit margins or begin to pass on some of the costs as\nprice increases.\nFigure 6 shows total and core PCE measures of inflation. The inflation measures have\nfluctuated recently around the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target, although there is a\nmodest upward trend over the past three years. Private forecasters in the Survey of Professional\nForecasters now expect PCE inflation to be just above 2 percent both this year and next.\nConsistent with my earlier comments on tight labor markets, I personally believe there are some\nupside risks to this outlook.\nFigure 7 shows PCE inflation separately for goods and services from 2003 through the\nsecond quarter of 2018. While services PCE inflation has been a bit above 2 percent over the\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npast two years, the more volatile goods PCE inflation has, for the most part, been below 2\npercent – although it has been rising recently.\nAs we study price movements, we need to consider trade and tariffs. Tariffs may be\npassed through, at least in part, to prices in goods-producing industries over time. But tariffs\nmay also be used as “cover” for passing through the rising cost of labor 1 as labor markets tighten\nfurther. Indeed, many of our business contacts in New England have highlighted that they now\nreceive little resistance to passing on price increases. These anecdotes may reflect an unintended\nconsequence of the tariffs: suppliers may now feel they have more pricing flexibility, posing an\nupside risk to measured inflation.\n\nReal GDP Growth\nFigure 8 shows the pattern of real GDP growth. At 4.2 percent growth, the second\nquarter of 2018 was quite strong. However, some of this growth likely reflects shifts in the\ntiming of spending in expectation of the imposition of tariffs on some goods. For example,\nsoybean shipments increased in the second quarter, apparently to beat the imposition of tariffs;\nshipments are likely to fall now that the tariffs are in place.\nOver the second half of this year, private forecasters are expecting that real GDP growth\nwill average around 3 percent, with growth next year ranging from 2 to 2.5 percent. Since that\nexceeds what economists call the economy’s potential rate of growth (somewhat below 2\npercent), I would expect to see further declines in the unemployment rate over this horizon.\nFigure 9 provides the pattern of consumption. While consumption growth slowed\nunexpectedly in the first quarter, it rebounded in the second quarter. Most forecasters expect\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconsumer spending to be a key driver of the economy, reflecting high consumer confidence,\nrising stock and housing prices, and continued growth in personal income.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and foreign growth, the trajectory for exports of\ngoods and services remains uncertain. Exports represent a sizable share of GDP, as shown in\nFigure 10. If retaliatory tariffs roughly match the tariffs imposed by the United States, the result\ncould be a roughly equal reduction in exports and imports, leaving the trade deficit\napproximately the same.\nHowever, tariffs increase the uncertainty around the path of net exports. Trade\ndisruptions could cause countries to source their purchases from new countries, for instance – but\nin many cases this is not a change that could happen easily or quickly. Moreover, uncertainty\nabout how long the tariffs might be in place makes the decision about whether to relocate\nproduction or to find new supply sources or markets even more difficult.\nOver the past 20 years, supply chains have become increasingly interconnected across\nmany countries for any one good. As suggested above, the threat of tariffs may disrupt the\nglobal supply chains, causing firms to source from more costly (without tariffs) – but potentially\nmore dependable – suppliers. These complex supply adjustments are likely to play out over an\nextended period. This implies a modest upward bias to the inflation forecast over the next\nseveral years. In an environment of strong growth and tight labor markets, these staggered onetime price changes run a greater risk of becoming more solidly incorporated into inflation\nexpectations.\nAn added concern for exporters is the higher value of the dollar, which makes it more\ndifficult for our goods and services to remain competitive, as shown in Figure 11.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRisks\nThere are certainly significant risks to the forecast. I will mention three here. First, the\nstrength of the U.S. dollar has generated complications for some emerging market economies.\nFigure 12 shows the significant currency devaluations for two emerging economies, Argentina\nand Turkey. Businesses in these countries that have borrowed in dollars will of course find it\nmore difficult to pay their debts as the value of their own currency falls relative to the dollar.\nA second challenge for emerging markets is the increase in oil prices. Many of the\nemerging economies are importers of oil that is priced in dollars (Figure 13), so rising oil prices\nonly complicate matters, as both higher dollar prices and a rising value of the dollar act as a tax\non these countries’ incomes. To the extent that emerging market growth is slowed by rising oil\nprices, this in turn will pose a challenge to U.S. growth.\nThere have also been increased concerns over a potential slowdown in China. Perhaps\nreflecting such unease, Chinese stock prices have declined recently (Figure 14). As a highly\nleveraged economy faced with significant tariffs, the risk of a more significant slowdown in the\nworld’s second largest economy should be considered.\n\nConcluding Observations\nI will conclude with a few final observations on policy. Figure 15 shows the median\npath of interest rate projections through 2021from the SEP. The median forecast in the SEP has\nthe federal funds rate rising to 3.4 percent. The median estimate for longer-run or equilibrium\ninterest rates in the SEP is 3 percent, so this implies interest rates gradually rising to become\nmildly restrictive.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMy own view is generally consistent with the SEP forecasts. I believe that Federal\nReserve policymakers will likely need to move interest rates gradually from a mildly\naccommodative stance to a mildly restrictive stance in order to best fulfil our mandate – stable\nprices and maximum sustainable growth.\nWhile this amounts to one person’s forecast, it is important to note that it is fully\nconsistent with a forecast of GDP growth above potential that leads to further tightening of labor\nmarkets, and inflation mildly overshooting the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, if\nsome of the risks that I have highlighted today become more germane to the outlook, a different\npolicy path would be warranted.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAdjusted for productivity.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFourth Annual O. John Olcay Lecture on\nEthics and Economics at the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 27, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. I want to thank the Peterson Institute for International Economics for\ninviting me to join you today. I am truly honored to be asked to give a talk in memory of John\nOlcay, whom I met through his connection to Harvard University professor Benjamin Friedman.\nI would see John on his periodic trips to Boston; our first meeting occurred in 2007, just as\nfinancial markets were starting to show stress. John and I shared rising concerns during this\nperiod and, unfortunately, through what turned into the global financial crisis and “Great\nRecession.”\nIn those days, John was troubled by the condition of financial markets, and also had a\ndeep concern about the human implications of serious economic downturns – a topic I am going\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nto focus on today. Before I do, however, let me note that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nGiven the matters with which John was concerned, it is very fitting that this lecture series\nis focused on “Ethics and Economics.” I should note that many academic disciplines incorporate\nethics into required coursework (take medicine, philosophy, or psychology, for example), but I\nwould argue that ethics is not an especially prevalent part of the curriculum of economics. In\nmost courses, core economic concepts tend to overwhelm the syllabus and displace the study of\nethical issues. If there is any discussion of ethics in profit- or utility-maximizing frameworks,\nmy sense is that it might take place in the last week of an introductory economics class. Given\nthis underweighting in the profession, I think it is wonderful that the Peterson Institute hosts this\nseries dedicated to ethics and economics.\nToday, my remarks will focus on some of the ways in which the impact of negative\noutcomes in the economy are distributed – disproportionately, I’ll argue. These distributional\neffects have ethical dimensions that should motivate economic policymakers to do more to\nreduce the negative outcomes.\nGiven the Fed’s dual mandate – stable prices and maximum sustainable employment – it\nmakes sense for us to look at inflation and unemployment as we begin today. First, inflation:\nFigure 1 shows that there has been quite a change in the pattern of inflation over the past 50\nyears, as measured by the change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex. In the United States, as in many advanced economies, the cyclical inflation pattern has\nbeen significantly muted. This moderation beginning around 1980 reflects, by the way, the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nimportant role that independent central banks could and did play in dampening the inflation\ncycles seen in the past.\nHowever, Figure 2 shows that the economic cycle, as measured by the unemployment\nrate, has not been muted and has not steadily moderated like inflation.\nTo preview my main points, in my view the costs of high unemployment are\ndisproportionately borne by those who can least afford them, and a variety of actions could be\ntaken by policymakers to make periods of high unemployment less likely. This brings us to the\nethical dimension of economics. This is not just about thoughts or feelings – I want to talk today\nabout manifesting those ethical decisions in very tangible policymaking. While there are many\nexamples of policies that could mitigate periods of high unemployment, today I will address\nthree specific realms of policy – state and local government spending; bank regulatory policy;\nand finally, monetary policy.\nFirst, however, I will touch on the impact of high unemployment and its distribution\nacross several dimensions of the population.\n\nThe Distributional Impact of Periods of High Unemployment\nThe United States has spent the past nine years recovering from a severe recession. Some\npopulations in particular suffered disproportionately, and despite the recovery, historic gaps\npersist.\nFigure 3 provides the unemployment rate by racial and ethnic background from 1972 to\n2018. The overall U.S unemployment rate hit 10 percent in the most recent recession – the\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsecond such time since 1972 in which the overall unemployment rate reached 10 percent.1\nHowever, it is striking that in every recession over this period, Black or African-American\nunemployment rates have exceeded 10 percent. Moreover, in the 1982 recession the Black or\nAfrican-American unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent; and in the most recent recession, the\nBlack or African-American unemployment rate exceeded 15 percent. Similarly, Hispanic\nunemployment during recessions is much more elevated than that of the overall population,\nalthough not as elevated as for Black or African-Americans.\nEconomic recessions also disproportionately impact unemployment for those with less\neducation, as shown in Figure 4. The figure shows the unemployment rate by educational\nattainment (ranging from less than a high school diploma, to a bachelor’s degree or higher) from\n1992 to 2018.2 While the unemployment rate for those with a college education reached 5\npercent during the most recent recession, the rate exceeded 15 percent for those without a high\nschool education.\nFurthermore, while unemployment significantly impacts individuals, it also affects\nfamilies. As Figure 5 shows, the share of U.S. children under age 18 who are below the poverty\nline increased significantly in the two recessions where the unemployment rate exceeded 10\npercent – with more than 20 percent of children below the poverty level during the Great\nRecession. Another sobering observation I take from this chart is that the child poverty rate in\nthe U.S. has dropped to 15 percent only once in the past nearly 60 years – hovering just above or\njust below 15 percent from 1969 to 1973.\nIn sum, the sad reality is that unemployment disproportionately affects minorities, the\nless educated, and children whose families are experiencing unemployment. The costs to both\nthe entire economy and to parts of our population are significant. In my view, if policies could\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmitigate the severity of economic slowdowns, some of those costs could be avoided – and taking\nactions now, when the economy is strong, could be particularly important to lessening the\nseverity of a hypothetical future downturn and its impact on individuals.\n\nState and Local Government Spending\nFiscal policy is certainly not in the Fed’s portfolio of mandated responsibilities, but it has\na major impact on the economy so we must take it into account.3 Drawing on the historical\nrecord, I want to suggest some opportunities for fiscal policy to address the issues I have just\nhighlighted. In my view, state and local government financing should be designed to buffer the\neconomy during recessions, or at a minimum should not reduce the stimulative effects of\nspending when the economy is most troubled.\nHowever, Figure 6 shows that since 1960, state and local government spending tends to\ndecline when the unemployment rate is high, and increase when the unemployment rate is low.\nThis pattern likely arises from the fall in state and local tax revenues during economic\ndownturns, coupled with a desire to spend within one’s means – after all, most state and local\ngovernments face balanced budget requirements. But it tends to aggravate economic downturns\nor add additional fuel to an already humming economy (scenarios that would be characterized as\n“procyclical” in the parlance of economists). And for context, state and local government\nspending is significant in the overall economy, accounting for 11 percent of U.S. GDP, compared\nto 4 percent for residential investment (which also tends to fall in economic downturns) and 7\npercent for federal government spending.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs I have just suggested, state and local governments likely reduce spending in\nrecessions for good reasons. I would suggest, however, that a number of steps can be taken by\nofficials that would lessen the problematic impact.\nFirst, the cyclicality of revenue sources for state and local governments can be lessened –\nin other words, revenue streams might be redesigned to move less cyclically if other competing\ngoals allow.4 For example, states that are highly dependent on capital gains taxes are much more\nlikely to experience funding shortfalls during economic downturns, so if possible, reducing this\ndependence could help.5\nSecond, steps can be taken so that the fiscal health of a state does not drive substantial\ncuts during downturns. A number of large states (such as Illinois or New Jersey) have seen\ndeterioration in their financial conditions over the past several years, as represented by declines\nin their credit ratings (Figure 7). This is, in part, the result of chronic underfunding of pension\nliabilities in some states. Ideally, a time like now – when the national economy is growing and\nemployment is robust – would be an opportunity, it seems to me, to prepare for the next\ndownturn. This would perhaps include shoring up state finances, reducing unfunded pension\nliabilities, and significantly increasing “rainy day” funds.6 I am not suggesting it would be easy,\neven in these economic times. But progress could be made. A similar argument could be made\nfor the federal government, given how beneficial it would be to have the capacity to be more\nfiscally expansive in a future recession.7\nIn sum, my view is that in the long run, states should consider how to balance the various\ncompeting goals of their fiscal approach – for example the goal of having stable revenue streams\nand of achieving progressivity. But to return to my main point, state and local governments\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshould reassess their revenue structure and fiscal approach with an eye on cyclical downturns\nand the potential to lessen their impact on people, through policy.\n\nBank Regulation\nWhile it may seem somewhat counterintuitive, banking regulation can also amplify the\nbusiness cycle, and policymakers can look for ways to lessen these effects. For example,\nlenders’ losses on loans tend to increase significantly during economic downturns, reflecting\nrising unemployment and the difficulty that many households and firms have in meeting debt\nobligations during hard economic times. Figure 8 shows that nonperforming loans at U.S. banks\ntend to rise during periods of high unemployment and fall during periods of low unemployment.8\nCertain aspects of bank regulation can actually exacerbate the consequences of this trend.\nFor example, capital regulations set a threshold on how low a bank’s capital – that is, its total\nassets (e.g. loans) less its total liabilities (e.g. deposits) – can fall. While this is well-intended –\nand designed to ensure that banks can meet all their obligations – certain aspects of capital\nregulations can actually cause banks to act in a manner that essentially extends their problems to\ntheir customers in a downturn.\nWhen their capital-to-assets ratio gets too low, banks can choose to either raise their\ncapital level, or shrink assets, to restore the ratio. Raising additional capital is especially costly\nduring economic downturns, and is generally opposed by existing shareholders who do not want\ntheir ownership stake diluted.\nAs a consequence, banks most often raise the capital-to-assets ratio by shrinking assets –\nand of course, loans are key assets for banks. Thus raising the capital-to-assets ratio can mean\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nless lending at just the time the economy may need stimulus. And banks may try to reduce\ndownturn-related losses by raising interest rates or tightening lending standards – both of which\ncan hurt otherwise credit-worthy borrowers.\nIn light of all this, I would suggest that – just as state and local governments need to\nshore up their finances and build their rainy day funds during a boom – it is incumbent on a bank\nto raise more capital during good economic times so that it can deplete that fund during a\nrecession, rather than shrink loans when the economy most needs them. An important regulatory\ntool that can be used to ensure that a bank builds up this so-called rainy day fund during good\ntimes is known as the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).9\nFigure 9 shows two different ways to implement capital regulations – one using a static\ncapital requirement and one using a variable capital requirement. We see a hypothetical scenario\nin which an economic downturn leads to a loss of 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) on\ncapital. On the left, this causes the bank to fall below its capital requirement, given that the bank\nwas holding 200 basis points of excess capital. As just described, banks often react by shrinking\ntheir assets to try to satisfy their capital requirement, reducing lending when borrowers most\nneed it.\nOn the right side of Figure 9, we see an alternate scenario in which the bank has\naccumulated a CCyB of 250 basis points during the good economic times that precede the\ndownturn, as required by regulation upon the activation of the CCyB. If the CCyB is deactivated\nwhen the economic downturn occurs and losses are realized, the bank has an additional capital\nbuffer of 450 basis points. As a result of the bank’s losses stemming from the economic\ndownturn, the buffer is consumed and reduced to zero. But the 300 basis point loss does not\npush the capital ratio below what is required, and thus the incentive to reduce lending is lessened.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile this type of CCyB is currently being used in many European countries and in Hong\nKong, the CCyB in the United States remains at zero.10 Given the overall health of the economy\nand the relatively rich asset valuations now prevailing, it is my view that this would be the ideal\ntime to build up capital buffers in the U.S. Doing so could help address the incentive that banks\nwill have to pull back on lending to shrink assets in a future economic downturn.11\n\nMonetary Policy\nMonetary policy is primarily conducted by moving short-term interest rates. During\ngood times, the interest rate is set to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and\nat the inflation target, which is 2 percent in the United States. However, when a recession occurs\nand the unemployment rate rises, policymakers push down interest rates. This has the effect of\nlowering payments for households and firms that are borrowing, and ideally mitigates the\nseverity of the economic cycle. As Figure 10 illustrates, since the Volcker disinflation episode\nin the late 1970s and early 1980s, the short-term federal funds rate has been lowered\nsignificantly, particularly during periods of very high unemployment rates.\nHowever, in the last economic cycle the inflation rate was relatively modest, and real\ninterest rates were low because of slow growth in population and productivity, so the federal\nfunds rate began the downturn at an already relatively low level. This meant that when the\nrecession hit, as the funds rate was reduced in response, it fairly quickly hit zero. Because shortterm interest rates started off low, the extent to which they could be reduced to offset high\nunemployment rates was limited.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs Figure 11 shows, estimates of the equilibrium interest rate12 have been declining.\nAccording to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), currently Fed policymakers\nanticipate that the median federal funds interest rate in the long run is expected to be only 2.9\npercent in nominal terms. Subtracting the Fed’s 2 percent inflation goals, this implies a long-run\nreal interest rate of just 0.9 percent.\nWhile the central bank has other tools to offset economic downturns, such as expanding\nits balance sheet to lower long-term interest rates, many economists view short-term interest\nrates as a more effective (and certainly a better-tested and understood) countercyclical tool. The\nFederal Reserve can do little to change the equilibrium real interest rate in the long run, since it\nis determined more by factors such as productivity and demographics. So it is appropriate to\nconsider other ways to avoid hitting zero with short-term interest rates. One possibility is to\nconsider more flexibility with the inflation target, perhaps focusing more on an inflation range\nthan a specific number.13 One might allow the inflation target to rise within the range during\nperiods of low real rates, thus providing more room for the funds rate to fall during an economic\ndownturn.\nSuch a change in the monetary policy framework is something that should be considered,\nalong with a careful assessment of the potential costs and benefits. However, if the monetary\npolicy framework is not changed, policymakers should look at other policy tools that can more\neffectively reduce the severity of recessions.\nCurrent policy also has a role in preparing for, or postponing, the next recession. As\nFigure 12 shows, over the time period since 1960, whenever the economy significantly exceeded\nfull employment, a recession ensued. The one counter-example is the 1960s, when fiscal policy\nwas quite expansionary because of the deficit-financed Vietnam War, even though the economy\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwas already running strong with the unemployment rate below the level associated with full\nemployment. However, that period was also characterized by rising inflation, which triggered\nsignificant problems in the following decade related to elevated inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nWhether imbalances appear as higher wages and prices, or higher asset prices, correcting\nimbalances in the economy (for example, if unemployment falls below a sustainable rate)\nwithout a recession is a challenge for central banks to accomplish. As a result, I think the policy\npath that will increase the probability of a longer recession-free period is the path where the\neconomy does not run above capacity and thus, fall far below the sustainable unemployment rate.\nI put these notions forward as policymakers continue to seek ways to lessen the severity and\nimpact – particularly the disparate impact – of cyclical economic downturns.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, while ethics is not generally a central focus of the discipline\nof economics, my view is that the costs of economic downturns – and the uneven distribution of\ntheir impact – are, in fact, ethical issues. I suspect our friend John Olcay would concur. Both in\nthe spirit of ethics and to sharpen policy effectiveness, I believe a more active discussion should\nbe occurring among fiscal, supervisory, and monetary policymakers. All of them, as I have\nsuggested today, could continue and perhaps expand their efforts to make cyclical downturns –\nand resulting periods of high unemployment – less severe.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M.

Rosengren: “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy\nTools: Are We Equipped for the Next Recession?” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.\n3\n\n4\n\nTax policies have multiple, often competing goals and therefore policymakers face tradeoffs. One important goal is\nto reduce income inequality. While income taxes (especially capital gains taxes) are very cyclical, they are often\nmore progressive (i.e., tax as a share of income is higher for higher-income households) than sales taxes and other\ntax vehicles.\n5\n\nCapital gains taxes are a large revenue source for many states. Cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes will\nautomatically require a very large increase in sales taxes and other taxes and fees if we talk about a revenue-neutral\nscenario.\n6\n\nLinking cyclical revenue sources (such as capital gains taxes) to rainy day funds could be a good compromise\namong maintaining high revenue-raising capacity, improving progressivity, and reducing cyclicality. In my view,\nthe macroeconomic effects have probably been underweighted. For additional discussion on the needed size of state\nrainy day funds, see 2014 Working Paper by Boston Fed Senior Economist Bo Zhao: “Saving for a Rainy Day:\nEstimating the Appropriate Size of U.S. State Budget Stabilization Funds.”\n7\n\nIt is worth noting that despite long-run fiscal challenges, lack of support during serious recessions extends the\nrecession, and thus extends the period of lost tax revenue, and exacerbates underlying woes in the state. In my view,\na short-term investment in a modest increase in indebtedness may pay back over time.\n8\n\nFurthermore, the combination of nonperforming loans and lower interest rates during recessions have the effect of\nadding pressure to banks’ earnings.\n9\n\nFor more info on the CCyB, see: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160908b.htm.\nIn addition to the CCyB, other bank regulatory tools include the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) and the Dodd-Frank Stress Tests (DFAST). There are countercyclical elements to the stress tests. More\nstressful scenarios in good times require banks to build more capital. For more on CCAR and DFAST see\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.\nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell noted in his recent press conference on June 13, 2018, “…the\ncountercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when\nfinancial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.” I am suggesting a slightly different application\nmight also be appropriate.

Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“The U.S. Economy: An Optimistic Outlook,\nBut With Some Important Risks”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce\nEconomic Outlook Breakfast 2018\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 13, 2018\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be back with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\n\nto share my economic outlook.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee).\nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the monthly employment report.\nWhile only 103,000 new jobs were created in March, the first quarter as a whole held quite\nstrong job growth. Over the first three months of 2018, the U.S. economy added an average of\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n202,000 jobs per month – which, over the longer run, is roughly twice as many as would be\nrequired to keep the unemployment rate stable at current levels of employment, given the growth\nin the labor force.\nThis strong first-quarter job growth occurred even though the labor market is already\ntight, as indicated by an unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, a rate that most economists consider\nto be below the sustainable rate of unemployment. Consistent with tight labor markets, wages\nhave been rising, albeit gradually – average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the past year,\nabout three-quarters of a percentage point faster growth than in 2013 and 2014.\nThe tight national labor market is also reflected in New England. When I talk to\nemployers around the Federal Reserve’s First District, which includes the six New England\nstates, I increasingly hear of the difficulty in attracting employees – and more and more business\nleaders mention the additional tactics their organizations must use to attract the talent necessary\nto move their businesses forward.\nThe relative strength of the first-quarter employment growth is consistent with the strong\neconomic forecast provided by monetary policymakers after the Federal Reserve’s FOMC\nmeeting in March. The median forecast of Fed policymakers was for the economy to grow\nsomewhat faster in 2018 than earlier in the recovery – specifically, 2.7 percent in 2018 (versus\n2.2 percent on average since the recovery began in the second quarter of 2009).1\nWith this growth projected to be fairly strong, the unemployment rate is expected to fall\nbelow 4 percent, with inflation rising close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target by the end\nof 2018. These forecasts, it should be noted, also incorporate the assumption of two additional\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n25-basis-point rate increases in the short-term interest rate during the balance of 2018, beyond\nthe one that occurred at the FOMC’s March meeting.\nMy own views are that labor markets may tighten more than the median SEP forecast\nsuggests, and that inflation is likely to increase a bit more than the current median forecast by\nFOMC participants. Therefore, I expect somewhat more tightening may end up being needed\nthan is currently reflected in the projected median for the federal funds rate.\nOf course, I am talking here about forecasts, not outcomes. Economic forecasts often\nprove imperfect, with actual results varying from the forecast in part because economists need to\nmake assumptions about variables that are quite hard to predict. Simply put, many important\neconomic decisions are not straightforward. For example, what will happen with tariffs around\nthe world over the course of this year? Will the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) significantly alter its production of oil? And how will foreign economies’\nmonetary policy change? Many of these questions require the forecasting of political outcomes\nrather than underlying economic relationships – and this is not an area of comparative advantage\nfor economists.\nGiven this reality, I will spend more time this morning discussing the risks around\nforecasts than I will the forecasts themselves. In particular, I will highlight two important risks\nto the economy in the short run (trade and overheating) and two potential risks in the long run\n(reduced capacity of both fiscal and monetary policy to act against downturns).\nLet me be clear that I am identifying risks, not making a prediction that they will happen.\nI think it is important to identify risks worth thinking about and watching for, and underline why\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npolicymakers need to continuously monitor incoming economic data and make adjustments\nshould the data come in other than expected.\n\nExploring the Forecasts from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nFigure 1 provides the actual inflation rate for the core personal consumption\nexpenditures or PCE (the solid line), and the median PCE inflation forecast from FOMC\nparticipants at the March meeting (the dashed line). As is clear from the chart, we have been\nundershooting the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. This undershooting has been\nlargely due to the decline in the relative price of imports from 2014 to 2016, and the decline in\ntelecommunications prices in early 2017. But that shortfall is forecasted to end soon – and it is\nnotable that Committee members expect an overshoot of the Fed’s inflation target in the medium\nterm.\nFigure 2 shows that the unemployment rate has been declining relatively quickly since\nthe first quarter of 2015, and that Committee members expect the path to level off in the medium\nterm at well below 4 percent. Notably, the median expectation for the longer-run rate of\nunemployment – usually taken to be policymakers’ estimate of the sustainable rate – is 4.5\npercent in the March SEP (the horizontal line). Clearly, policymakers expect very tight labor\nmarkets in the short and medium term relative to what we expect to prevail in the longer term.\nFigure 3 shows the actual path of the federal funds rate from the first quarter of 2015 to\nthe first quarter of 2018, and the median of SEP projections of the federal funds rate’s path\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020. The median forecast is for three 25-basis-point increases in\n2018 (including the increase which followed the March FOMC meeting) and another three in\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n2019. So again, it is worth noting that the gradual rise of inflation toward – and then above – its\ntarget, and the projection for a falling unemployment rate that dips well below its estimated longrun sustainable level, occur despite the gradual tightening of monetary policy assumed in FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts. Importantly, some of the underlying economic strength in these forecasts\ncomes from the projected effects of substantial fiscal stimulus, generated both by tax cuts and by\nthe higher government spending incorporated in the recent federal budget.\nIn summary, the Committee’s median outlook is fairly optimistic. My own forecast calls\nfor an even more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate, given my expectation that\ncyclical strength in labor force participation will provide only a partial offset to solid gains in\npayrolls. Despite this positive outlook, I think it is important to consider the risks around this\nforecast. So now I will touch on what I see as some short-run risks, and then some longer-run\nrisks.\n\nShort-run Risks\nThe first risk I want to discuss today is one that has been on the front pages of\nnewspapers and has also been reflected in the increased volatility of financial markets recently:\nthe outlook for international trade. Figure 4 shows exports of goods and services relative to\nGDP from the first quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017. While the United States\nis less dependent on exports for growth than are many of our major trading partners, exports are\nstill a relatively large component of total goods and services produced in the U.S. economy. At\nroughly 12 percent of total goods and services, exports play a much smaller role in the overall\neconomy than consumption, which is roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. But exports play\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\na larger role than, for example, housing, which accounts for roughly 4 percent of the overall\neconomy. Of course, here I am taking a macroeconomic view of the economy; I recognize that\nsome industries and firms will feel more acutely any changes in the export and trade\nenvironment.\nSome context is important. It would take a significantly broader set of trade actions than\nthose reported to date to materially reduce the roughly $2.4 trillion in annual U.S. exports. Still,\nspillover effects are possible, beyond just the industries where exports could be affected by\npossible trade barriers. There could also be indirect economic effects from trade disputes with\nimportant, but difficult to measure, impacts. For example, concerns about possible supply\ndisruptions might cause firms to source supplies from other countries – and the new capacity in\nthese other countries could potentially mean less U.S. investment and employment.\nA second possible impact is on prices. As Figure 5 shows, prices of imported goods\ngrew at a slower pace than overall inflation, thus holding down overall inflation over the last\nseveral years. Indeed, imported goods prices fell until about the beginning of 2017, in part\nbecause of a strong dollar, although that trend appears to be changing more recently. Of course\nthe imposition of tariffs also pushes up prices that consumers pay for goods impacted by the\ntariff. In addition, actions to avoid possible tariffs can cause precautionary stockpiling, which\ncan disrupt the flow of orders and cause production bottlenecks. Concerns about these possible\ndisruptions likely explain some of the heightened volatility in stock prices of late.\nBeyond trade issues, there is a second short-run risk to the outlook, and it moves in the\nopposite direction. While I expect the unemployment rate to drop to 3.7 percent by the end of\nthis year, it is possible that unemployment will fall even more rapidly in the short-term. An\nundesirable “boom-bust” scenario may become more likely if unemployment moves far below\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwhere we expect labor markets to settle in the long-run. Figure 6 shows the difference between\nthe actual unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of the\nnatural rate of unemployment from 1970 to the first quarter of 2018, with recessions shaded.\nToday, unemployment is already below the CBO estimate of the natural rate. As the graph\nshows, periods in which unemployment dipped significantly and persistently below the estimated\nnatural rate historically have tended to generate conditions that resulted in a recession.\nWhile labor markets provide important indicators of potential unsustainability, it is\nimportant to be alert to financial stability issues as well. As Figure 7 shows, the spreads between\ncorporate bonds and 10-Year U.S. Treasuries have fallen to relatively low levels, and several\nacademic studies have highlighted that the investor confidence that generates low credit spreads\noften precedes subsequent economic reversals.2\nLet me reiterate that I am not forecasting significant trade disruptions or substantial\nboom-bust problems. But the risk that they could develop means we must be very carefully\nmonitoring incoming data to see if they indicate an increased probability that these risk scenarios\ncould occur.\n\nLong-run Risks\nThere are also longer-run risks that should be considered at this juncture in the economy.\nWith monetary policy still relatively accommodative, and fiscal policy quite accommodative, it\nseems unlikely that the economy would perform poorly in the near term. However, it is\nimportant to consider whether some of that accommodation may potentially generate risks that\nplay out over the longer term.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne of the risks is illustrated by the CBO projection of public debt levels that was\nrecently released. Gross federal debt as a percentage of GDP, shown in Figure 8, has been rising\nover the past decade. The dotted line shows the current projection through 2028. This debt-toGDP ratio will rise to levels not seen since just after World War II. My concern is this: by using\nup so much fiscal capacity now – by which I mean the ability to lower tax rates or boost federal\nspending to offset economic weakness – the country risks not having sufficient fiscal capacity in\nthe future when it might be needed. And this lack of fiscal capacity would be particularly\ntroubling if monetary policy could not aggressively offset adverse shocks.3\nFigure 9 shows that there is also some reason to be concerned about how aggressively\nmonetary policy can respond to a large adverse shock. At the onset of most previous economic\nrecessions, short-term interest rates were quite high. This provided plenty of room to reduce\ninterest rates as the economy went into recession. The one time that short-term interest rates\nreached zero in recent history was in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Once the FOMC cut\nthe short-term policy rate to its effective lower bound, reaching the limit of stimulus from that\ntool, the Federal Reserve employed its balance sheet to purchase longer-term assets, thus\nlowering longer-term interest rates and providing further monetary accommodation and stimulus.\nThese actions, which I fully supported, were nonetheless politically controversial and the subject\nof some debate among economists.4\nSo how much room do we expect to have to lower interest rates in response to future\nrecessions? The Federal Reserve’s SEP includes a forecast of where short-term interest rates\nwill settle in the long run. The most recent median forecast for the longer-run federal funds rate\nis 2.9 percent, which is quite low by historical standards. The underlying reason for this is that\nmost Committee members expect real interest rates to be quite low, due to a demographically\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndriven slowing in labor force growth coupled with slow growth in productivity. Combined with\na 2 percent inflation goal, this implies low long-run, short-term policy rates, implying that on\naverage we could lower rates by less than 3 percentage points in response to a recession. Since\nin many recessions we lower rates by as much as 5 percentage points, it is quite likely that\ninterest rates would reach zero again in a downturn.\nCertainly expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and perhaps using other lessconventional monetary policy interventions, can help support the economy, should it be needed.5\nHowever, several questions and concerns exist. How effective will these unconventional tools\nbe in offsetting adverse shocks? Is there significant opposition among the public and Congress\nto the Fed using nontraditional tools? How limited will fiscal policy be in buffering an adverse\nshock or downturn? These questions, while a bit sobering, highlight the need to increase the\npotential of policy buffers to respond to possible future problems.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe outlook for the economy projected by participants in the March FOMC meeting is\nquite positive. My own forecast is somewhat stronger in terms of unemployment rates and\ninflation outcomes than the SEP forecast, which is why I am in favor of somewhat more\ntightening than the median FOMC member. However, a forecast of the most likely outcome is\nnot a promise, and there are important potential risks to that forecast. Disruptive international\ntrade actions or increasing the risk of a boom-bust economy by overextending could, in my view,\nprove problematic for the economy. And the status of fiscal and monetary “buffers” call into\nquestion their ability to work against a shock or downturn.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on\nMonetary Policy\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nGood evening. I would like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak\nat this, the tenth conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy. I would\nlike to commend all of today’s presenters for their research contributions, and I am looking\nforward to Saturday’s sessions.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI particularly appreciate the chance to focus today on monetary policy and financial\nstability. Much of my own research has focused on the ways that problems in the financial\nsystem can ripple through to the real economy. Certainly the last financial crisis – and the\nensuing Great Recession and very slow recovery – underlined the role that financial instability\ncan play in disrupting the economy and in slowing its recovery. These episodes also helped\npolicymakers sharpen their thinking about the need for policy tools that can be deployed to\nattempt to prevent financial instability, as well as minimize the effects of instability when it does\nemerge.\nFinancial stability policy is generally associated with regulatory and supervisory\nmeasures, so the exercise of financial stability policy is often seen as being independent from the\nstance of monetary and fiscal policy. However, I am going to suggest that policymakers should\nview financial stability tools more holistically. Indeed, I would like to suggest that the ability to\nappropriately set financial stability tools is integrally related to the ability to fully utilize fiscal,\nmonetary, and financial stability policy tools to respond to a large adverse financial shock.\nFigure 1 provides a chart that shows how often from 1987 to 2008 the FOMC\nparticipants used words associated with financial stability concerns. The analysis of FOMC\nmeeting transcripts is taken from a paper I wrote with Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\neconomists Geoff Tootell and Joe Peek.1 While there are mentions of financial instability terms\nduring the times when markets are doing unusually well, the largest spikes in the series are\nassociated with the occurrences of adverse financial shocks – particularly when they are\naccompanied by an economic downturn.\nTools intended to enhance the resilience of the financial system, such as increased capital\nand liquidity requirements, are important – and in my view, should be emphasized more\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthroughout an economic cycle. But the analysis we did suggests that the focus on financial\nstability concerns is most intense when the adverse consequences are apparent.\nCrisis prevention is an important matter for further discussion, and one on which I\nbelieve we have made progress through implementing key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act – but prevention is not really the focus of my remarks this\nevening. Tonight, I would like to focus on the tools that are available to policymakers once a\nsignificant adverse financial shock occurs (that is, crisis response).\nIf an adverse financial shock occurs, fiscal, monetary, and financial tools can all play a\nrole in offsetting the economic fallout that often results – even though maintaining financial\nstability is not the primary goal of monetary or fiscal policy. But if monetary and fiscal policy\nhave limited capacity to respond to such shocks – because public debt is already high, or because\ninterest rates are already low, for example – then this should figure into policymakers’ thinking\nabout how and when to use financial stability tools.\nTo be a bit more specific, I have in mind using a broad set of tools to respond to any large\nadverse financial shock that could have a broad impact on the economy. On the fiscal side,\nwhich of course the Fed does not control, that would likely include cutting taxes and increasing\ngovernment spending. Monetary policy tools would include conventional tactics (reducing\ninterest rates) and less conventional ones (like expanding the central bank’s balance sheet\nthrough asset purchases). Finally, I would note how important it is that financial stability tools\nprovide sufficient buffers.\nThe use of financial stability tools is generally seen as being conditioned on and\ncalibrated to the severity of likely economic stresses – but I would argue that it is also critically\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nimportant to take into account the extent to which monetary and fiscal policy are equipped to\nrespond to an adverse financial shock, so that policymakers can best coordinate the response to a\ncrisis across all available tools. Much of what I have in mind has to do with assessing each\npolicy tool’s capacity to respond.\nFor example, suppose that a country’s government-debt-to-GDP ratio is high, limiting the\nability or willingness to use fiscal tools to offset financial and other shocks. If that country has\nalso not developed sufficient financial stability response tools, then most of the countercyclical\npolicy response will likely fall to monetary policy. Alternatively, if the government-debt-toGDP ratio is extremely high and interest rates are already at or near the effective lower bound,\nand the country is unable or unwilling to use less-conventional monetary tools like quantitative\neasing, then financial stability tools are likely to be more important. In sum, it is important to\nconsider whether there is sufficient capacity in the toolkit for policymakers to adequately (let\nalone optimally) respond to severe financial shocks.\nTurning to current conditions in the United States, our economy is now experiencing a\nvery low unemployment rate – in fact, a rate below the level many would associate with full\nemployment. In part due to relatively tight labor markets, we are beginning to see modest\nincreases in wage and price inflation, and a more rapid increase in asset prices. Most economists\nexpect continued solid growth and strong labor markets, so this may be the time to focus on\nwhether we have adequate buffers among the available policy tools – to be prepared, should\nanything disrupt the recent trajectory.\nUnfortunately, I would argue that rather than building sufficient capacity for possible\ndownturns – which, by the way, I am not expecting or predicting – the U.S. has actually seen a\nreduction in the capacity of these so-called “buffers” across the policy tools. If fiscal and\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmonetary policy tools are likely to be limited in the event of a large adverse shock, I would\nsuggest that policymakers need to think about and act on creating greater capacity and flexibility\nwithin the tools currently available – including those most directly related to financial stability.\n\nMonetary Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nFigure 2 shows the federal funds rate, covering the same period – 1987 to 2008 – as the\nearlier chart depicting mentions of financial instability terms by FOMC participants, and\nindicating the same episodes of financial disruption.2 One can see that when a significant\nfinancial stability shock occurs, the Fed usually lowers the funds rate out of concern that the\nshock might precipitate slow growth or a recession. During the 2008 financial crisis, the federal\nfunds rate was reduced to zero and the central bank’s balance sheet was expanded. In prior\nepisodes, the funds rate was high enough that the Fed had plenty of room to reduce it – that is,\nplenty of cushion. When the monetary policy cushion is substantial, the need for very large\nfiscal or financial stability buffers may be correspondingly reduced.\nSimple math suggests that the ability of conventional monetary policy to respond to a\ncrisis is currently somewhat constrained, given low prevailing rates. Figure 3 shows FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts of the federal funds rate likely to prevail in the longer run from the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP). As real interest rates have been depressed by slow\nproductivity and by demographic changes, FOMC participants’ estimates of the federal funds\nrate in the longer run have declined; the median is currently 2.9 percent.\nSuch a low “neutral” or long-run federal funds rate suggests a monetary policy cushion\n(again, the leeway to lower the funds rate) that is small by historical standards. As is shown in\nFigure 4, in most recessions the Fed lowers the nominal federal funds rate by much more than 3\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npercentage points. So in an economy like ours with low equilibrium interest rates, there is a\nstrong likelihood that in a hypothetical future recession, policymakers will run out of room to\nlower the federal funds rate, and we will hit the effective lower bound.\nWhile my own view is that unconventional policy can be a very important tool to provide\nstimulus once the effective lower bound is reached, it is fair to acknowledge that policymakers\nknow far less about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy than they do about\nconventional, short-term interest rate policy. Perhaps even more constraining is the political\nunpopularity in many countries of central bank balance sheet actions. All this means that such\npolicies could be avoided by policymakers, or even constrained by lawmakers, in the future.3\nAs I suggested earlier, if the monetary policy cushion available to offset financial shocks\nis smaller, policymakers should consider how the full array of policy tools might be used to\naddress such shocks. Sticking with monetary policy for a moment, one approach could be to\nchange the monetary policy operating procedures to make it less likely that the effective lower\nbound is hit in the future, perhaps by using an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target,\nas I have discussed in a recent talk.4 If this monetary policy approach is not feasible,\npolicymakers may wish to consider whether Countercyclical Capital Buffers should be increased,\nor other financial stability tools employed, to provide greater buffers to adverse shocks.\n\nFiscal Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nFigure 5 shows the U.S. federal government surplus or deficit, measured as a percentage\nof GDP. Fiscal policy has tended not to respond to financial stability shocks unless they are\naccompanied by a recession. Fiscal policy responses include “automatic stabilizers,” such as\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment benefits, which rise automatically as newly-unemployed workers file for benefits\nduring significant economic downturns. While fiscal policy tools normally are not deployed for\nfinancial stability shocks, we can surmise that, were an accompanying recession to be large\nenough, a possible inability or unwillingness of fiscal policymakers to offset financial stability\nshocks with expansionary policy could exacerbate the problem.\nFurthermore, we should recognize that fiscal limitations can impact the choices that\npolicymakers have to utilize potential financial stability tools. In response to the financial crisis,\nthe U.S. was much more willing than Europe or Japan to provide direct capital infusions into the\nfinancial system, which arguably limited the severity of credit crunches and promoted a quicker\nrecovery in the financial sector in the U.S., relative to Europe.\nThere was sufficient fiscal capacity during the financial crisis to expand the deficit and\nengage in fiscal actions that promoted a faster recovery, but naturally such actions require a\nfiscal buffer that makes it possible to finance the effort. Figure 6 shows the general government\ngross debt as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S. fiscal\nresponse to the financial crisis placed the government-debt-to-GDP ratio much closer to that of\nEuropean countries. What’s more, the Congressional Budget Office’s current projections, done\nbefore the recent tax changes and increases in the federal budget, indicate that were a financial\ncrisis to occur in the near-term, the U.S. would potentially have less fiscal capacity to respond as\naggressively as it did during the last financial crisis.\nThe U.S. fiscal situation is noteworthy because of the experience of some European\ncountries during the last recession. In particular, those European countries with severe banking\nproblems were mostly southern European countries, and they experienced serious fiscal\nproblems in addition to serious banking problems. Those countries in Europe with less severe\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbanking problems but substantial fiscal capacity did not want to use their fiscal capacity to\nresolve banking problems in other European countries. As a result, the banking problems could\nnot be easily resolved with capital infusions from governments, resulting in banking problems\ndragging out and many European banks tightening credit availability in the middle of an\neconomic downturn, in order to improve their capital-to-assets ratios. Thus the fiscal capacity\nproblems caused difficulties in resolving financial stability problems, making both worse.\nIn sum, running large fiscal deficits can potentially have ramifications for the ability to\nrespond to possible future financial stability shocks. If fiscal policy responses to financial\nstability crises are likely to be more constrained in the presence of larger government-debt-toGDP ratios, it seems prudent to consider bolstering the tools available to monetary policy and\nfinancial stability policy.\n\nFinancial Stability Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nIn many countries, a variety of financial stability tools are available,5 but this is not the\ncase in the United States. The two primary financial stability tools available to the Federal\nReserve to respond to financial shocks are, first, altering the scenarios used in the bank stress\ntests that are applied to the largest banks, and second, the setting of the Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer.\nThe stress test is primarily a microprudential tool, designed to ensure sufficient capital for\nbanks in the event of a large financial shock, and is dependent on the risk characteristics of the\nindividual institution.6 By “stressing” particular assets, the test alters the cost of capital for that\nasset class, with the overall impact on any financial institution depending on its exposure to the\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nasset class and its sensitivity to changes in cost of capital. Thus, the stress test does not alter the\namount of post-stress capital relative to the bank’s reported capital for all firms in the same way.\nFirms’ post-stress capital may decrease (or increase) relative to reported capital by varying\nmagnitudes, depending on the mix of assets and hence the mix of risks.\nThe Countercyclical Capital Buffer, on the other hand, is intended to be a\nmacroprudential tool. The buffer increases capital for all financial firms it applies to during\nperiods of financial excess, but is intended to release capital during stressful periods.7 Because it\nis not related to particular stress scenarios, it does not alter the cost of capital for specific assets\nand does not impact institutions differentially depending on exposure to specific assets.8\nMoreover, it is intended to be lowered during stressful times in order to release capital for\nstronger banks, so that binding capital constraints are not addressed by reducing credit\navailability to firms and households.\nFigure 7 provides the peak unemployment rate included in the severely adverse scenario\nsince the stress tests began in the U.S. in 2009, the current level of the unemployment rate at the\ntime of the development of each scenario, and the difference between the two. The stress test\nhas quite high unemployment rates in its scenarios, even during periods when the actual\nunemployment rate is already high. As the actual unemployment rate has fallen, the change from\nthe current rate to the scenario peak has increased. As a result, the stress test as currently utilized\nmay not effectively release capital in a crisis. It is certainly possible that the stress tests could\nencourage banks to reduce credit availability to shrink assets to satisfy binding capital\nconstraints. As always, we have to examine the possibility of unintended consequences and\nassess whether it may work at cross purposes to other tools designed to speed the recovery from\na negative financial shock. While this reflects its focus on ensuring the solvency of individual\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ninstitutions relative to particular stress scenarios, it highlights why other tools may be better\ndesigned to release capital to avoid reductions in credit availability.\nIn contrast, a financial stability tool that is designed to be countercyclical is the aptly\nnamed Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Once an adverse financial stability shock occurs, the\nbuffer would be reduced, releasing bank capital so the institution does not need to shrink its\nlending – and thus reduce credit availability to firms and consumers – by shrinking assets to\nsatisfy a binding capital constraint.\nOf course, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer has to be raised in times of financial excess\nif it is to build capital that can be used when adverse shocks do occur. Figure 8 shows that many\ncountries have indeed raised their Countercyclical Capital Buffer. In the U.S., the\nCountercyclical Capital Buffer remains at zero.9\nEven if one were to ignore the opportunity to strengthen financial stability tools, in my\nview an argument can be made for increasing the Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Figure 9\nshows that commercial real estate valuations are quite stretched, as indicated by capitalization\nrates reaching series lows, particularly for apartment buildings (recall that the “cap” rate is the\nratio of net operating income to the price paid for the property at the time of a transaction – a\nshorthand for the income yield that the property is expected to provide). While low cap rates are\nto be expected in a low-interest rate environment, Figure 10 shows that the ratio has been\nimportantly driven by price increases, particularly for apartment buildings.\nTurning to equities, Figure 11 shows that by historical standards current S&P 500\ncomposite price-to-earnings ratios are at the high end of what we have observed since 1968.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThis is even clearer if we use the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio shown in\nFigure 12.\nWith asset valuations high, a non-zero Countercyclical Capital Buffer can in my view be\njustified. However, the case is even stronger in the U.S. if one considers that should a shock\noccur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be expected to respond as forcefully as they did\n– appropriately so, I would add – in the last financial crisis and its aftermath.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would argue that now is the time to assess and strengthen\nthe various policy tools available to respond to adverse financial shocks – and yet, the tools have\nactually been diminishing. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy buffer has essentially been\ndepleted as the nominal equilibrium interest rate in the United States has fallen. This makes it\nmore likely that the effective lower bound will be hit in the U.S. if we experience an adverse\nfinancial stability shock (or any other adverse shock) at some point in the future. Since monetary\npolicy can do little to prevent the demographic or productivity changes that lead to lower\nprevailing rates, I believe that policymakers should consider adjusting the monetary policy\nframework, to address the possibility that the capacity of conventional policy tools may be too\nquickly depleted.10\nFiscal policy buffers are being bolstered in some European countries as their economies\nimprove. However, we must acknowledge that the same cannot be said for the United States.\nThe government-debt-to-GDP ratio is high by historical standards in many countries, but we see\nthat it is rising in the U.S. My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemerged in 2008 will simply give future policymakers less flexibility to respond to a\nhypothetical large financial stability shock with fiscal policy tools.\nSome countries have been using macroprudential tools to increase their policy buffers.\nWhile capital ratios in the U.S. are much improved, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which\nwas designed to be released in response to a large adverse financial shock, is currently set at\nzero.\nMany countries are not well equipped to address an adverse financial stability shock. In\nthe United States, one can see that monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential buffers are modest, and\nin many cases are being drawn down further. In my view, now should be the time that\npolicymakers carefully consider this state of affairs, and assess which tools could provide more\npotent buffers to draw upon should a large adverse financial shock occur. While that is, again,\nnot my expectation or prediction, my view is that it is an opportune time to prepare for such a\npossibility.\nThank you.\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell.

Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nOver the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen and is now below even the lowest\nestimates made by Federal Reserve policymakers (FOMC participants) for the level that is likely\nto be sustainable in the longer run. As labor markets have tightened, we have seen a gradual\nincrease in wages and salaries. While inflation 2 is still a bit below the FOMC’s target, most\nforecasters expect inflation to rise to, or near, the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2018.\nDespite this good news, the stock and bond markets have become much more volatile in\nrecent weeks. This likely reflects, in part, the realization that financial markets need to factor in\nthe risk that wages and prices could grow too quickly, if there were too much fiscal and\nmonetary stimulus – particularly with the economy currently at or beyond full employment and\ninflation approaching the Fed’s goal. I view the underlying insight as a healthy realization by\nmarket participants that the risks are two-sided: Unsustainably strong growth that leads to\nexcessive inflation or financial imbalances is now as much a risk as growth that falls short. And\nthere is a realization that monetary policymakers need to be vigilant in calibrating the level of\naccommodation, if continued sustainable growth is to be achieved.\nTo be more specific, as inflation approaches the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and\nunemployment remains below what we see as a sustainable rate, it is appropriate for the Fed to\ncontinue to remove monetary accommodation by gradually raising interest rates. At the\nDecember FOMC meeting, the median of Fed policymakers’ estimates of “appropriate monetary\npolicy” called for 75 basis points of additional rate increases over the course of 2018. My own\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nview, at that time, was actually that somewhat further removal of accommodation might well be\nneeded in 2018. That assessment remained dependent on the tenor of incoming data, of course.\nAnd since the December FOMC meeting, we have all observed a mix of news: fiscal\nspending, a large tax cut, and continued strengthening of economies around the world provide\nsupport to U.S. growth. But, on average, household and business spending data have come in a\nbit weaker than expected, leading many to revise down their forecasts for the current quarter.\nEven so, most forecasters currently expect growth this year to exceed its sustainable pace, which\nimplies further tightening of labor markets and more wage and price pressures over time. Thus,\non balance, developments since December generally reinforce my view of the need for somewhat\nmore removal of accommodation than was reflected in the December median Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP). Of course, following through on this expectation is conditional on\nthe economy unfolding about as expected, and that unexpected events such as a trade war or a\nsubstantial change in the geopolitical situation do not surprise on the downside.\n\nRecent Developments in the Economic Outlook\nImprovements in the economy over the past year have, in large part, been driven by\nstrong consumer spending. This is not unusual for the U.S. economy, of course, since consumer\nspending accounts for roughly two-thirds of real GDP. As Figure 1 highlights, consumption\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was quite strong, at 3.8 percent.\nHowever, as the figure also shows, forecasts for the first quarter of 2018 are for much\nslower consumption growth. This forecast, from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, preceded\nthe relatively weak retail sales reported for January. If retail sales continue to disappoint,\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconsumption for the first quarter of this year may well be below that projected by forecasters in\nearly February.\nWhat is the likelihood that we will continue to get weak readings on consumer spending?\nThat is difficult to say, but my view is that the data we have seen so far most likely reflect a\ntemporary pause in this quarter, following unexpectedly strong growth in the fourth quarter of\n2017 – and as a consequence, we will probably continue to see solid consumption growth over\nthe balance of this year.\nMy optimism in this regard is driven by the relatively strong fundamentals that support\nconsumption growth. Figure 2 shows that household wealth has been rising, and is well above\nthe level from the beginning of 2016. This gain reflects continued increases in housing wealth\ndue to rising house prices in many areas of the country, as well as steady gains in the stock\nmarket. While there have been some sizable stock market declines in recent days, Figure 3\nshows that current stock prices remain at roughly the levels they achieved in December 2017.\nOutside of stock market levels, there has been a notable increase in volatility. One\nmeasure of stock volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index\n(VIX), had been unusually low in 2017. This very low market volatility can lead investors to\ntake on more risk, and in a period of still relatively low interest rates, to “reach for yield” – that\nis, buy riskier assets than one would otherwise, in order to achieve a desired profit or savings\ngoal. Clearly, as can be seen in Figure 4, stock market volatility has increased significantly in\nrecent weeks. From a financial stability standpoint, I view the increased volatility as an\nimportant reminder to market participants that stock prices can be quite sensitive to economic\ndata. 3\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 5 illustrates that despite an increase in market volatility, consumers’ confidence in\nthe strength of the economy remains high, well above index levels for 2017. While there has\nbeen some weakness in the higher-frequency consumer data, I view high consumer confidence as\nconsistent with the fundamental underpinnings of consumer spending that I discussed a moment\nago, and suggestive that what we are seeing now will turn out to be a pause by consumers after a\nvery strong fourth quarter.\nFigure 6 shows that the Blue Chip forecasters seem to share my optimism. For much of\n2017, the forecasters had expected U.S. real GDP for 2018 to result in growth of 2.4 percent.\nHowever, with the significant reduction in taxes and the increases in government spending, as\nwell as the continued improvement in the national economies of trading partners, the consensus\nforecast now anticipates real GDP growth to be 2.8 percent for the year. Such a rapid increase is\nlikely to be primarily driven by the fiscal stimulus. It remains to be seen, however, what signal\nBlue Chip forecasters may take from the more recently released weaker consumption data.\n\nOutlook for Inflation\nSome observers of Federal Reserve policy have been concerned about the low inflation\nreadings for much of 2017. I have viewed those soft data as likely to be transitory, reflecting\nsharp temporary changes in relative prices – such as modifications in wireless service pricing by\nU.S. mobile carriers last spring. Recent data have given me more confidence in that assessment.\nFigure 7 shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for inflation as measured by the\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) for 2018. The Blue Chip survey focuses on the CPI, which tends to\nrun approximately 20 to 30 basis points higher than the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nindex, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. The figure shows that in the first\nquarter of 2017, forecasters expected that 2018 CPI would be running at 2.3 percent, consistent\nwith the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target using the PCE measure of inflation. However, in the\nspring of 2017, with some large relative price changes, forecasters began to lower their\nexpectations for 2018 inflation – reaching estimates as low as 1.9 percent by late summer. More\nrecently, their forecasts for 2018 CPI inflation are back where they were in early 2017.\nFigure 8 illustrates how the data have changed more recently, by averaging the PCE\ninflation data over one year, over six months, and over three months. The year-over-year change\nin the PCE index remains somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, as some of the\nsoft data from last spring have lowered this 12-month change. However, more recent readings\nthat exclude those spring observations (that is, the six month data and the three month changes)\nshow a rate of inflation above our 2 percent target.\nOne final factor that may have temporarily elevated the index is oil prices. Figure 9\nprovides a similar chart for the inflation measure that excludes the volatile food and energy\nprices, the so-called core PCE inflation rate. More recent readings for core inflation suggest that\nwe have been right at our 2 percent target for the past three and six months.\n\nLabor Market Developments\nAnother factor that gives me some confidence that the Fed will continue to hit the\ninflation target is the strength of the labor market. Figure 10 shows that the number of\nindividuals filing initial claims for unemployment insurance is at low levels not seen since the\nlate 1960s and early 1970s, when the labor force was considerably smaller than it is today. This\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlikely reflects a number of positive factors, including: strong demand for workers that derives\nfrom a strong pace of sales for goods and services; employers’ reluctance to lose employees,\ngiven the difficulty they would face in hiring replacement workers; and the fact that potential\nemployees who lose or switch jobs are able to find new employment without suffering a spell of\nunemployment.\nAnother way to assess labor market tightness is to look at labor flows – in other words,\nhow workers move between being employed, unemployed (not working, but looking for work),\nand out of the labor force (neither employed, nor looking for work). 4 Figure 11 shows the flow\nfrom being employed to unemployed. Official data for gross worker flows begin in the early\n1990s, and consistent with the data on initial claims, the employment-to-unemployment flow is\nnear a recent low.\nFigure 12 shows the flow from being out of the labor force to being unemployed. This is\nnear the early 2001 series low, reflecting that when workers decide to enter or reenter the\nworkforce, they find employment opportunities quickly.\nFigure 13 shows the flow from being out of the workforce into employment. This series\nis at a recent high, reflecting that in a tight labor market more potential workers are being drawn\ninto the workforce. While this is a particularly good sign for hard-to-employ workers, it also\nhighlights a potential future problem: the supply of workers outside of the labor force and willing\nto reenter the labor market will become a constraint over time. 5\nAs we experience the welcome development of more workers entering employment from\noutside of the workforce, there will be an increasing need for training and other aspects of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkforce development. As I mentioned at the outset of the talk, that is one of the areas that the\nSpringfield team has chosen to focus on for their Working Cities Challenge initiative. 6\nOf course, with labor markets tight, some employers will attempt to attract new\nemployees by offering higher wages and benefits, raising the average compensation paid to many\nemployees over time. Figure 14 shows the employment cost index measure of wages and\nsalaries for private industry workers, excluding incentive-paid occupations. This wage measure,\nalong with a number of others, has been gradually trending upward over the past several years.\nAs the labor market continues to tighten – which would be consistent with the 2.8 percent Blue\nChip forecast for 2018 real GDP growth – one would expect to see continued upward pressure on\nwages and salaries.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would say that the economic data have been quite good,\nmonetary policy remains accommodative, and fiscal policy has just become quite a bit more\nstimulative. While a tight labor market provides definite advantages – such as employment\nopportunities for workers who have struggled to find a job – nonetheless, providing too much\nstimulus from either monetary or fiscal policy at this stage of the economic cycle could threaten\nto create a so-called “boom and bust” economy, which policymakers certainly want to avoid.\nTo keep the economy on a sustainable path, I expect that it will be appropriate to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation at a regular but gradual pace – and perhaps a bit faster than the\nthree, one-quarter point increases envisioned for this year in the assessment of appropriate policy\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfrom the December 2017 FOMC meeting. This expectation assumes, of course, the data continue\nto come in more-or-less consistent with my outlook.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe Working Cities Challenge is an initiative of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, designed to lead smaller\ncities through a rigorous process that builds cross-sector collaboration to solve issues impacting the lives of these\ncities’ lower-income residents. Grounded in Boston Fed research, the Challenge encourages leaders from the public,\nprivate, and nonprofit sectors to advance proposals that tackle complex challenges facing smaller post-industrial\ncities and achieve large scale impact across communities. Included in the initiative is a grant competition designed\nto accelerate promising work already underway.

At some point, the available supply of workers will become a constraint on our ability to grow, although I\ndo not believe that we are there just yet.\n\n6\n\nFor more information on the Springfield Working Cities Challenge effort, see:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round2/cities/springfield.

I thank the GIC for this award, which of course honors a\nremarkable individual, Fredrick Heldring, whose life story1 is inspiring. He was courageous in\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe Dutch Underground in World War II, successful as a banking leader, a passionate advocate\nfor investment in inner cities, and committed to many civic and philanthropic causes.\nBefore I begin my remarks today, let me note as I always do that the views I express are\nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nI would like to start by reflecting on the past year’s economic performance, which was\nbetter than most forecasters were expecting a year ago. U.S. labor markets have continued to\nimprove; and with the unemployment rate now at 4.1 percent, I think we have clearly left the\nperiod of the Great Recession behind. Real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2017\nwas over 3 percent – well above the level of growth economists call “potential.” By definition, if\nabove-potential growth continues, as expected by many forecasters, labor markets will tighten\nfurther, likely pushing the unemployment rate well below its sustainable rate.\nInflation has also been subdued, especially considering that it has already been a fairly\nlong economic recovery by historical standards. Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve\nto pursue a very gradual exit from the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation undertaken\nto address the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the slow recovery. The Fed’s policy\naccommodation, along with a well-recovered economy, have been generally good for asset\nprices, including stocks.\nWhile the economic news has remained positive, the extent of the forecast “misses” by\nFOMC participants and private sector forecasters – our forecast errors for both inflation and\nunemployment – are relevant for the topic of this conference on money and models. On a\nquarterly basis, FOMC participants provide their economic forecasts for key economic variables,\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncalled the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP. At the December 2016 FOMC meeting,\nthe median SEP forecast was that 2017 would finish with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent\nand core inflation (measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index)\nat a rate of 1.8 percent. Instead, the unemployment rate ended up 0.4 percent lower than\nexpected; and core PCE inflation, based on the data through November, was 0.3 percent lower\nthan expected. While these are not overwhelming forecast errors by historical standards, the\ninflation miss, in particular, has received significant attention by some observers – as inflation\nhas been lower than expected, despite labor markets that are tighter than expected.\nMy own perspective on this is that the recent misses in the Fed’s inflation forecast have\nnot been particularly large, taken in the context of the forecast errors made historically in\nforecasting inflation. The forecast errors for inflation also have not been particularly consistent\nor persistent, which would be expected if the Fed’s inflation models were missing some\nfundamental change in the inflation process. As a result, I would argue that it does not seem\njustified to assume there have been changes in the underlying inflation process, based on\nrelatively modest recent misses. Of course, if we continue to experience one-sided forecast\nerrors for another year or two, the possibility of structural change should be considered more\nseriously.\nThus, I do not view the somewhat lower than expected recent inflation rate as particularly\ntroublesome for near-term monetary policy. But looking to the medium and long run, I do see\nlow and fixed inflation targets as a potential problem – particularly if we continue to experience\nlow productivity growth, a low equilibrium interest rate, and the near-certainty of a slowly\ngrowing and aging workforce. In such an environment, with a two percent inflation goal,\nnominal interest rates are likely to be low, on average. As a consequence, when a recession\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neventually does occur, policymakers would likely start with a low policy rate – perhaps 3 percent\nor so – leaving little room to lower rates to offset the effects of the recession. The desire to\nretain an adequate “policy buffer” – by which I mean the amount of room we have to lower rates\nto offset recessions – lies at the heart of my evolving thoughts on the appropriate monetary\npolicy framework.2\nIf, as a result, we seek to avoid a prolonged low interest rate environment in the future,\nthen my view is that policymakers should start studying and discussing alternative frameworks to\nmake this outcome less likely. While there is little that monetary policy can do to impact\nproductivity or labor force growth, policymakers can influence the prevailing level of interest\nrates by adjusting our medium-term inflation goal.3 One option would be targeting a higher\ninflation rate,4 so that nominal interest rates would be higher than otherwise – and there have\nbeen other more technical proposals (for example price-level targeting and nominal GDP\ntargeting) designed to provide a greater buffer.5\nI would also suggest that the optimal inflation rate is not likely to remain constant over\ntime. An alternative, which would recognize that the inflation target should not necessarily be\nconstant, is an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target. Within this framework, one\ncould think of our inflation goal as defined by two components: A range of inflation rates that\npolicymakers would find acceptable across many economic circumstances, and a medium-term\ngoal within that range that policymakers would set, perhaps year by year, depending on specific\neconomic circumstances.\nIn my view, adopting an inflation range that allows for movement in the effective\nmedium-run inflation goal might be a helpful addition to the Fed’s monetary policy framework.6\nAn inflation range that allows some movement in the inflation target, depending on economic\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfundamentals, would be treating the Fed’s inflation goal more like the natural rate of\nunemployment, where we recognize that the natural rate will shift over time with demographic\nand other workforce characteristics.\nOf course, the advantages of greater inflation target flexibility would likely be partly\noffset by some costs. For instance, it is likely that such flexibility would generate more\nuncertainty about inflation in the medium to long run, since we cannot know for sure how long\nproductivity and demographic trends would persist.7 However, if we set the range to – for\nexample – 1.5 to 3.0 percent, and were successful in keeping inflation mostly in that range, this\nwould represent a set of inflation outcomes that are similar to those the U.S. has experienced\nover the past 20 years.\n\nPerspectives on Recent Forecast Misses\nAs previously mentioned, once a quarter, FOMC participants provide their economic\nforecasts for key economic variables. Among the charts that are included are the so called “fan\ncharts,” shown in Figure 1 for PCE inflation. The fan chart shows that even at a 70 percent\nconfidence level, the forecast errors for PCE inflation are quite large. Thus, with the current 2\npercent forecast, it would not be at all surprising to have actual inflation turn out to somewhere\nbetween 1 to 3 percent.\nThe sources of these forecast misses are many: large, unexpected changes in energy,\nfood, import or other volatile prices can temporarily disrupt overall inflation measures relative\nto the forecast; the economy can grow faster or slower than we expect; or our assessment of what\nis relatively fast or slow can be off. A good example of an unexpected price change is the\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmodification in wireless service pricing by many U.S. mobile carriers that occurred last spring.\nThis change is one of the factors that lowered the PCE inflation rate relative to the forecast in\nDecember 2016.\nFigure 2 provides some history on SEP8 and private-sector forecast errors, comparing the\nmedian core PCE inflation rate forecast for one-year-ahead to the actual rate, based on both the\nSEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ fourth quarter forecasts for each year.9 While\nthe forecast error (based on the 2016 fourth-quarter forecast for the core inflation rate10 for the\nfourth quarter of 2017) was clearly a miss, it certainly was not outsized relative to other oneyear-ahead forecast errors made over the past 10 years. In addition, forecasters made both\npositive and negative forecast errors during this period, not persistently missing in one direction.\nThis forecast record seems inconsistent with concerns of some observers who argue forecasters\nare missing some fundamental attribute of inflation dynamics.\nFigure 3 provides forecast errors for the unemployment rate forecast, by comparing both\nthe SEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ median unemployment rate forecast for the\nfourth quarter of the next year with the actual rate, for each fourth-quarter forecast. While the\n2016 fourth-quarter forecast error for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 is not\nparticularly large relative to previous years, there do seem to be persistent, consistent forecast\nerrors in the same direction for the unemployment rate, unlike for the inflation rate. That is,\nsince 2010, forecasters have regularly anticipated the unemployment rate would fall less than\nactually occurred.\nFrom a short-run policy perspective, the inflation forecast errors do not seem to be\nparticularly noteworthy, and would not seem to indicate serious forecast biases over the past\ndecade. In contrast, the persistent forecasts that unemployment will not fall as much as has\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\noccurred should provide policymakers pause, since at 4.1 percent the unemployment rate is\nalready well below most estimates of the sustainable long-run unemployment rate. The most\nrecent median estimate for the natural rate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is 4.5\npercent; the corresponding median longer-run unemployment rate estimate from the December\nSEP is 4.6 percent.\n\nModels and the Monetary Policy Framework\nSince January 2012, the FOMC has published a statement of longer-run goals and\nmonetary policy strategy11 that it reaffirms, sometimes with small modifications, at each January\nFOMC meeting. The statement provides the FOMC’s tactical approach for meeting the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate provided by Congress: fostering economic conditions to achieve both\nstable prices and maximum sustainable employment.\nThe statement explicitly defines the inflation goal as being a 2 percent inflation target.12\nThe employment mandate does not have a numerical target because the natural rate of\nunemployment is primarily determined by non-monetary factors, must be inferred from other\neconomic data, and has moved significantly over time.13 The statement also clarifies that when\nthere are misses in both elements of the dual mandate, the Committee should follow a balanced\napproach, by which we mean that we will give equal policy attention to deviations of\nemployment from an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from its 2\npercent target.\nAt the time of adoption of the statement on longer-run goals, the 2 percent inflation target\nwas quite similar to the target set by most other central banks in developed economies.14 Many\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nacademic studies advocated for a 2 percent inflation target as being consistent with price\nstability, although many of them were conducted prior to the Great Recession. Most of this\nresearch that attempted to determine how large a policy buffer would be sufficient – and thus\nhow high a target inflation rate would be best – generally estimated that interest rates were\nunlikely to reach the effective lower bound, but if they did, the expected duration at near-zero\ninterest rates would be measured in quarters, not years.\nUnfortunately, the economic history of the past 10 years has shown that many developed\ncountries in the wake of the Great Recession and financial crisis were forced to hold interest\nrates near zero for many years, much longer than the earlier model estimates suggested.15 Such\nlow interest rate environments make it difficult to conduct counter-cyclical monetary policy, and\ncan potentially undermine financial stability, as households and firms “reach for yield” in the\nface of low interest rates, almost always taking on additional risk as a consequence.\nIt is not surprising, in my view, that many estimates assumed that a period of prolonged\nlow interest rates was unlikely. In an economy with rapid increases in productivity and an\nexpanding labor force, periods of prolonged low interest rates are likely to be avoided in most\nrecessions. However, the size of the negative shock from the Great Recession, along with\nfundamental changes in the economy,16 have made it much more likely that future recessions\ncould also result in prolonged low interest rates and a need to conduct monetary policy with\nnontraditional methods, such as asset purchases on central banks’ balance sheets – rather than\njust through movement of short-term interest rates.\nFigure 4 shows FOMC participants’ assessments of the longer-run rate that the federal\nfunds rate will settle to when the Fed has achieved both elements of the dual mandate.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecognizing the effects of slower productivity growth and labor force growth on this so-called\n“neutral” rate of interest, SEP submissions have gradually lowered this measure since 2012.\nIn early 2012, both the median forecast and the central tendency of FOMC participants\nwas that the federal funds target rate in the longer-run would be at least 4 percent. As of\nDecember 2017, both the median forecast and most of the central tendency expect that the\nfederal funds target rate will be below 3 percent.17 Since most recessions involve lowering the\nfederal funds target rate by more than 300 basis points, this makes it seem quite likely that a low\ninterest rate environment will become a more common occurrence.\nFigure 5 illustrates one possible reason for the decline in the expectations of the longerrun or neutral federal funds rate. Productivity growth is much lower now than it has been for\nmuch of the previous 50 years. This lower productivity growth, as long as it persists, implies\nthat real interest rates are likely to be lower on average.\nFigure 6 provides another reason to expect lower real interest rates, which is the\nreduction in the growth in the civilian labor force. With slower population growth, fewer\nimmigrants, and an aging population, the growth in the labor force is expected to be much lower\nfor quite some time than it has been in previous decades. Again, this implies lower real interest\nrates.\nOne way to avoid periods of prolonged low interest rates would be to alter the inflation\ntarget in response to changes in our estimates of real interest rates – estimates that have been\nchanging of late. This would make inflation, like the natural unemployment rate, a target that\ncould vary over time. If, for example, the monetary policy framework set an inflation range of,\nsay 1.5 to 3.0 percent, the FOMC could vary its medium-term inflation target to be high, low, or\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nin the middle of the range depending on economic factors that the Committee could determine at\nthe beginning of each year. For example, in the current environment, with low population\ngrowth and low productivity growth, policy could move even more gradually to remove\naccommodation, and allow inflation to be somewhat higher in its range. Should the labor force\nor productivity grow more quickly, the Committee could seek to gradually reduce the inflation\ntarget within its range.\nUsing an inflation range would trade off the costs of more effective policy responses to\nrecessions (and the potential financial stability risk that may attend prolonged low interest rate\nperiods), with the costs of having somewhat less certainty about what the inflation rate would be\nin the long run. But as long as the inflation rate were in a relatively narrow band, such as 1.5 to\n3.0 percent, the range would not be a dramatic change from actual experience and would\ntherefore be less likely to impact inflation expectations. If changes in productivity and labor\nforce growth occurred very infrequently, the inflation target would be stable – but at a level more\nconsistent with avoiding prolonged low interest rates.\n\nConcluding Observations\nRecent forecast errors of inflation and unemployment have not been particularly large,\nand do not pose much challenge to continuing on the current path of gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate. Perhaps the bigger risk for short-run policy is the fact that the unemployment\nrate continues to fall further below sustainable levels, and will likely continue to do so going\nforward, risking the sustainability of the recovery.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA more significant longer-run matter, from my perspective, is the opportunity for the\nFederal Reserve’s current monetary policy framework to adapt to the recent experience with\nprolonged low real interest rates. If the U.S. economy is to avoid a scenario in which the\neffective lower bound is reached and the central bank must use its balance sheet for asset\npurchases rather than move short-term interest rates for counter-cyclical monetary policy, then\npolicymakers should consider alternative monetary policy frameworks that would make such\noutcomes less likely.\nAn inflation range with an adjustable medium-run inflation goal is one way to address\nsuch concerns, but there are a variety of alternative frameworks also worth considering.18 In my\nview, we are approaching a time when a comprehensive reconsideration of the monetary policy\nframework is likely warranted, given the experience of the past 10 years. Any change we make\nshould be designed to provide policymakers with the flexibility to set monetary policy\nappropriately as key features of the economy change, as they have repeatedly over U.S.\neconomic history.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.interdependence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HeldringObituary.pdfhttps://www.interdependence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring-Obituary.pdf.\n2\n\nFor additional discussion, see Jan. 8, 2018 remarks at the Brookings Institution by Eric S. Rosengren, Reviewing\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2018/reviewing-monetarypolicy-frameworks.aspx\n3\n\nOn average, overall or nominal interest rates equal the prevailing real rate of interest plus the average inflation rate\n– which should be near our inflation goal – we can move the overall average level of nominal rates one-for-one by\nchanging our inflation goal.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M.

Or would we expect to adjust the medium-term\ninflation goal down when real rates are unusually high? And what status does the center of the range hold? Do we\nintend for inflation to average somewhere near the center of the range over a longer span of time?, Do we always\nplan for inflation to return to the center of the range at some horizon?\n7\n\nIn addition, FOMC participants would no doubt consider adjusting our medium-term inflation goal up or down\nonly when we (and others) had estimated that a persistent change in real rate determinants had occurred and was\nlikely to continue. Such an assessment is of course difficult and entails uncertainty\n8\n\nPrior to the June 2015 medians, SEP medians are only available with a five-year lag. Proxies for the medians for\nthe December 2013 and 2014 one-year-ahead forecasts for the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015, for core PCE\ninflation and the unemployment rate used in the forecast error calculations for Figures 2 and 3 are calculated from\nthe distribution of FOMC participants’ projections reported in ranges of tenths in the FOMC meeting minutes.\n9\n\nOf course, the actual values are revised over time. We have used the most up-to-date figures in the calculations.\n\n10\n\nWhile total PCE is the target for this exercise, we used core PCE to avoid outsized errors that would be related to\nthe often volatile food and energy prices.\n11\n\nIn order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued\nthe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public\nwhat monetary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting\npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed.\nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy\nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation\ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer-run values. The\nstatement became effective Jan. 24, 2012, and was subsequently amended, effective Jan.31, 2017. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-fomc.htm.\n12\n\nThis is measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n\n13\n\nFor example, the natural rate has varied as the demographic composition of the labor market has changed.\n\n14\n\nTwo percent was seen as a practical compromise between some academic work that suggested that zero (or even\nnegative) inflation was optimal, and work on the other hand that saw value both in “greasing the wheels” of wage\nsetting given reluctance of workers to take nominal wage cuts, and in providing the policy buffer that I have just\ndiscussed that comes with a positive inflation rate.\n15\n\nOnce the central bank gets stuck at near-zero rates, additional counter-cyclical monetary policy can only be\nprovided through alternative monetary policy measures such as quantitative easing, which aims to directly influence\nlonger-term interest rates and other asset prices.\n16\n\nFor example, declining productivity growth and slowing labor force growth.\n\n17\n\nAs of December 2017, the SEP median longer-run federal funds rate was 2.75 percent and the central tendency\nwas 2.75 to 3.00 percent. Looking at the individual observations from the SEP “dot plot” shows that the majority of\nthe central tendency expects a rate of 2.75 percent.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n18\n\nSome have suggested simply raising the inflation goal, which would of course provide more of the policy cushion\nI have discussed today. Others have proposed using price-level targeting or some variant of it, which is a way of\npromising future inflation when the economy is weak, thus (in theory) adding stimulus by lowering real interest\nrates. This policy also has the advantage of making the price level – the cost of living – more predictable. And some\nhave suggested following a nominal GDP target. The virtue of this framework is that it is flexible with respect to the\nmix of overall nominal growth that comes from real growth versus inflation. When real growth is slow, inflation is\nallowed to rise higher, similar to the flexible target range approach I have outlined.\n\n14\n\n\f",

It is a pleasure to be here at Brookings. I’d like to thank David Wessel\nof the Hutchins Center for inviting me to participate in this forum. It is also my pleasure to be\nhere with John David Murray of the Bank of Canada, to provide some observations in response\nto his comments. 1\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe monetary policy framework adopted by the Federal Reserve is rooted squarely in our\n“dual mandate” from Congress, which directs the Fed to seek maximum sustainable employment\nand stable prices. 2 And in the spirit of today’s conference, I want to pose a couple of questions\nthat tee up my remarks. Given that the Congressional mandate has not changed, why might it be\nbeneficial to evaluate the Fed’s monetary policy framework periodically? And relatedly, why is\nthe framework not as durable as the Congressional mandate?\nImportantly, the Congressional mandate is quite broad. It was not until 2012 that the\nFederal Reserve explicitly defined the stable-prices component of the mandate in numerical\nterms, as a 2 percent inflation target tied to total PCE inflation. 3 The second half of the mandate,\nmaximum employment, was not assigned a numerical target given that the Fed does not, of\ncourse, set the natural rate of unemployment – and estimates of the natural rate have changed\nconsiderably over time, with changes in demographic and labor-market characteristics.\nSince 2012, the FOMC has voted at the beginning of each year on a statement of longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, which provides a long-run goal for inflation (the 2\npercent target) and broadly defines a monetary policy strategy. Currently, the strategy involves a\nso-called balanced approach: the Committee gives equal weight to deviations of employment\nfrom an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from the 2 percent target.\nIn light of this, one could argue that the U.S. version of the Bank of Canada’s five-year\nreview actually occurs at a yearly frequency at the Federal Reserve. However, the Federal\nReserve’s annual reaffirmation of the longer-run inflation goal and monetary policy strategy has\nnot regularly involved the extensive discussion, and incorporation of outside comments, that are\npart of the Bank of Canada’s process.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFrom my perspective, it is possible that the absence of more involved debate regarding\nthe Federal Reserve’s inflation goal and monetary policy strategy reflects the fact that the FOMC\nis broadly comfortable with the status quo framework for achieving monetary policy goals and\nour mandate. Still, with this in mind, I would suggest that there are several compelling\narguments for a more robust periodic review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy\nframework.\nFirst, admittedly the choice of the 2 percent inflation target reflected a commonly used\ntarget of other central banks, and was consistent with a literature that viewed a 2 percent target as\nlikely to be in the neighborhood of optimal. However, much of that literature was based on precrisis research that estimated that the effective lower bound for the policy interest rate would\nrarely be hit, and that interest rates would remain at the effective lower bound only briefly. That\nresearch appears to have significantly underestimated the real-world probability of hitting the\neffective lower bound. Moreover, the probability of hitting the effective lower bound is higher\nin an economy with a low equilibrium real interest rate, as would be associated with our current\ncharacteristics of slow productivity growth, slow population growth, and aging demographics.\nIn fact, the optimal rate of inflation may move around just as does the natural rate of\nunemployment.\nSecond, the ability to achieve an inflation target over a reasonable amount of time has\ncome into question as the U.S., Euro Area, and Japan have all fallen short of their inflation\ntargets, regularly and quite consistently, since the onset of the financial crisis. Notably,\nundershooting on inflation has occurred despite aggressive use of less-traditional monetary tools\ndesigned to make policy more accommodative in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Great\nRecession, and very slow recovery. 4\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThird, U.S. policymakers must take into account complicating factors. . With fiscal\npolicy constrained by rising debt-to-GDP ratios, and questions about the potency of\nnontraditional monetary policy tools in generating robust recoveries, the trade-offs between the\ngoals – and even the optimal level of the goals – may be different now than when the FOMC\nadopted the framework.\nIn light of all this, in my view it may be a good time to consider putting in place a\nperiodic Federal Reserve led assessment of the U.S. monetary policy framework that would\ninclude input from a variety of sources inside and outside the central bank. Such a periodic reevaluation could consider whether changed economic fundamentals (such as the equilibrium real\ninterest rate) should alter how best to satisfy the Congressional mandate given to the central\nbank.\nFurthermore, a periodic reassessment could involve consideration of whether alternative\nframeworks would better meet the mandate, and evaluate the costs and benefits of transitioning\nto the new framework – as well as the longer-run implications. For example, in recognition of\nthe challenges the Federal Reserve has experienced with our current framework, a reassessment\nmight include discussion of whether an inflation range, nominal GDP targeting, or price-level\ntargeting would help the Fed better achieve its Congressionally-mandated goals. In fact, my\nown view is that we should be focused on an inflation range, with the potential to move within\nthe range as the optimal inflation rate changes. This will be the topic of a talk I am giving later\nthis week, when I will have an opportunity discuss the suggestion more fully.\nSimilar to the Bank of Canada, a U.S. review could include research papers by Fed\neconomists, as well as input from academics and other macro-policy institutions. This type of\nperiodic exercise could reinforce the Federal Reserve’s commitment to attaining the\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCongressional mandates, while providing a more public and transparent forum for evaluating our\nperformance in attaining these goals.\nFinally, I would note that a number of process details could influence the efficacy of such\na review process. The Bank of Canada has a full review every five years. One does not want to\nevaluate a monetary policy framework too frequently, given that changes in underlying\neconomic fundamentals are relatively infrequent and take time to fully assess. At the same time,\nit is important to make changes if the existing framework is no longer consist with how the\neconomy has evolved.\nIt would also be extremely important to design a review process that appropriately\nbalances the central bank’s accountability to Congress for the mandate with its independence to\npursue policymaking and technical refinements. Reviews would need to focus on the structural\nchanges that have reduced the efficacy of the Fed’s monetary policy framework, not the injection\nof short-term partisan political influence. While any significant change in the framework should\ninvolve active consultation with Congress – as was the case when the Fed formally adopted its\nnumerical price objective in 2012 – the review should be focused on the technical framework\nthat the central bank employs to achieve the Congressional mandate’s goals and would need to\nbe seen as such.\nMy own personal preference would be to conduct a full review with a specified frequency\n– possibly longer than the five years used by the Bank of Canada – but to make it possible to call\nfor an earlier review when warranted. Given the unpredictability of changes in the optimal\ntargets, providing the option to call for a special review would be important. This would allow\nfor a re-examination when needed – specifically when most participants view economic events\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nas justifying a full re-examination of the framework. Clearly, however, this is just one approach\nand there are a variety of other permutations that could be considered by the FOMC.\nIn summary and conclusion, the Bank of Canada provides a process which I view as quite\ninstructive. My own view is that the costs of hitting the effective lower bound, and staying there\nfor a prolonged period, should cause a reassessment of whether a specific 2 percent inflation\ntarget is still warranted. The optimal inflation rate is unlikely to be 2 percent if economic\nfundamentals cause the central bank’s policy rate to regularly hit the effective lower bound\nduring economic downturns. As a result, having a process that can fully and more transparently\nexamine the monetary policy framework would be a process improvement, and would allow the\nFederal Reserve to systematically examine and alter its framework when needed.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAs John Murray illustrated in his presentation, the Bank of Canada has a process for revisiting its inflation target\nand monetary policy framework that has been in place for quite some time. This process occurs at a regular five-year\nfrequency, it seeks comments from academics and the general public and, though not legislated, it features the\nexplicit involvement of the government. See http://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/.\n\n2\n\nThe dual mandate is derived from The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. Among the changes made to the\nFederal Reserve Act was a directive to \"maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals\nof maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The shorthand for this is the goal of\nmaximum employment consistent with stable prices.\n\n3\n\nIn order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued\nthe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public\nwhat monetary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting\npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed.\nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy\nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation\ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer-run values.\nThe statement became effective January 24, 2012, and was subsequently amended, effective January 31, 2017. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-fomc.htm.\n4\n\nAs already mentioned, the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy specifies a balanced\napproach on stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and the unemployment rate around its natural level. It\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncould be useful to periodically assess the extent to which such an approach is followed in practice, and the reasons\nthat may lead to deviations from such a strategy.\n\n8\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Economic Policy Forum Fall 2017\nDepartment of Economics, Northeastern University\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 15, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. I would like to thank the Department of Economics at Northeastern\nUniversity for having me here today to share my views on the economy and monetary\npolicymaking. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nEach year at the January meeting of the FOMC, the Committee adopts what is called the\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 1 This document represents the\nframework that the FOMC will use to achieve the dual mandate that Congress has set for the\nFed: maximum employment and stable prices.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nLet’s consider those two elements of the mandate for a moment. For much of the\nrecovery from the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has been too high, and the inflation\nrate too low – consistent with an economy facing serious difficulties. Those outcomes clearly\njustified the highly accommodative monetary policy that the Federal Reserve deployed.\nHowever, more recently, as economic conditions have improved, inflation has remained\nstubbornly below the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target, 2 while the unemployment rate has declined\nso much that it is now well below the level viewed by most FOMC participants as a sustainable\nunemployment rate. 3\nLow inflation would, of course, justify more stimulative monetary policy, other things\nbeing equal, while quite low unemployment might suggest tighter monetary policy. How should\nthe FOMC balance the dilemma implicit in the current readings on these two elements of the\nFed’s mandate?\nFortunately, the current Statement on Longer-Run Goals provides some guidance.\nSpecifically, it states: “Under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives\nare not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account\nthe magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which\nemployment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.”\nIn this, the Statement provides some useful guidance for navigating the current\ncircumstances. First, Committee participants must determine the magnitude of the deviations of\nthe dual mandate variables from their desired levels. Simply put, how far is inflation from the 2\npercent goal, and how far are we from maximum sustainable employment? Calculating the\ninflation deviation is straightforward; the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure of\ntotal inflation in the U.S. is currently 1.6 percent, and the Fed’s inflation goal is 2 percent, so the\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\ndeviation is 0.4 percentage points. The unemployment deviation, however, is more difficult to\nassess, as maximum sustainable employment and the related concept of the natural rate of\nunemployment are only estimates. Central bankers must infer the level indirectly, using\ninformation in wages, prices, expectations, and labor market conditions. What’s more, estimates\nof the natural rate of unemployment in the economy vary over time, due to demographic and\nother changes in the workforce, or changes in the efficiency with which workers find jobs.\nAs a result, there is unavoidable uncertainty in gauging whether the economy is at\nmaximum sustainable employment, and how large the gap is – unlike the situation with the\ninflation gap. Still, today I will show a few indicators that suggest to me that even with some\ninherent uncertainty in estimating maximum sustainable employment, the economy seems to\nhave moved beyond that point in recent quarters, and will likely continue to move further away –\nsince most forecasters expect real GDP growth to exceed potential for the next several quarters.\nReturning to the guidance offered in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals, the\nCommittee must also estimate how long employment and inflation will deviate from the Fed’s\ngoals. This is a bit more difficult. Monetary policy works with lags, typically long and variable,\nand there are many factors – other than monetary policy – that impact inflation and\nunemployment. In part for these reasons, forecasts of unemployment and inflation are subject to\nsubstantial error. Nonetheless, forecasts are the only means policymakers have for assessing\nhow long we are likely to deviate from the Fed’s dual mandate, so we must rely on them.\nAt the same time, policymakers must also be alert to systematic errors in forecasts that\nmay reflect changes in underlying relationships. In this regard it will be important to consider\nwhy inflation has recently been coming in lower than projected.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nDeviations from the Federal Reserve’s Mandate Goals\nFigure 1 provides total and core PCE inflation since 2012. Total PCE inflation is\ncurrently 1.6 percent, which – as mentioned earlier – is 0.4 percentage points below the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target.\nWhile it is not surprising that inflation was below the Fed’s target early in the recovery\nperiod, when there was significant labor market slack, policymakers had expected inflation to\ngradually return to 2 percent as the economy reached or surpassed full employment – as long as\ninflation expectations remained well-anchored around the central bank’s inflation goal. Recall\nthat while the Fed’s inflation objective is expressed in terms of total PCE inflation, readings on\ncore PCE inflation, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, are important because they\ngenerally provide a more reliable indicator of the underlying trends in inflation. Earlier this year,\ntotal inflation exceeded the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. But core inflation has\nremained below that target for the past five years.\nFigure 2 shows the widely reported U-3 unemployment rate, along with an estimate of\nthe natural rate of unemployment from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). As the\nfigure indicates, the unemployment rate has fallen steadily over the past five years, and is now\nbelow FOMC participants’ most recent 4.6 percent median estimate of the natural rate of\nunemployment. It should be noted that this current estimate of the natural rate is about 0.2\npercentage points below the estimate that was published at the time of the December 2016\nFOMC meeting. At 4.1 percent, we are currently 0.5 percentage points below the FOMC’s\nmedian estimate of the natural unemployment rate. My own estimate of the natural rate of\nunemployment, 4.7 percent, has not fallen over the past year, and implies an unemployment rate\n0.6 percentage points below what I view as the sustainable rate.\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nHence it appears that the weak inflation number is in opposition to (rather than consistent\nwith) the strong employment number. However, as mentioned earlier, the natural rate of\nunemployment is not measured, but rather is estimated; as a result it is of course possible that\nthere may be more labor market slack than is implied by Fed policymakers’ estimates of the\nnatural rate based on the U-3 unemployment rate. I will turn to that question now.\n\nHow Much Labor Market Slack Do We Currently Have?\nOne way to assess whether the unemployment rate (the widely reported U-3 rate) is\nactually below its sustainable rate is to see if other labor market indicators also indicate a lack of\nslack in the labor market. To preview the punch line, the data I will walk you through seem\nconsistent with labor markets being quite tight.\nFor example, initial claims for unemployment insurance (which are derived from\nindividuals filing for unemployment compensation in their state, rather than from the household\nsurvey that serves as the basis for the unemployment rate), provide an indication from an\nalternative data source. Figure 3 shows the four-week moving average of initial claims for\nunemployment insurance. 4 Despite the spikes in the weeks around hurricanes, initial claims are\ncurrently at lows last seen over 40 years ago. These lows could reflect firms’ reluctance to fire\nworkers given the difficulty to hire replacements, or workers ability to quickly find jobs so that\nthey never actually file for unemployment. Either explanation is consistent with unusually tight\nlabor markets.\nFigure 4 shows similar information from another source. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(BLS) designates all working-age persons as either employed, unemployed (not working and\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsearching for employment), or outside of the labor force (not working and not looking for\nemployment). The BLS provides data on gross flows among these conditions beginning in 1990\n– and the figure shows that the gross flow from employment to unemployment, scaled by the size\nof the labor force, is at its lowest point in decades. This fact is consistent with the message from\nthe initial claims data: separations from employment to unemployment are now rare.\nFigure 5 shows the flow of people moving from not in the labor force to unemployed,\nscaled by the size of the labor force. This flow results from new entrants to the labor force and\nfrom individuals who had previously stopped working, or stopped looking for work, but who\nhave begun to search for employment again. The current value is the lowest point since the start\nof the Great Recession and close to the overall low over the more than 25 years. Such a low\nreading may reflect firms actively seeking and employing workers who are not currently\nsearching, or who just began their search – or individuals who search and quickly find work.\nFigure 5 shows that the flow of workers who are outside of the labor force moving to\nunemployment is low, but Figure 6 shows that the flow of sidelined workers moving to\nemployment is high (Figure 6 shows the flow of people from not in the labor force moving to\nemployed, scaled by the size of the labor force). These patterns are good news for individuals\nwho might have left the labor market when it was weaker, or who were discouraged from\nlooking for jobs at that time. But the patterns also suggest that the labor market is getting quite\ntight.\nFigure 7 shows average hourly earnings and the employment cost index, excluding\nincentive-paid occupations. Both series have clearly been trending up over the past five years.\nThey are now at levels roughly consistent with a long-run full-employment benchmark, the sum\nof the inflation rate plus productivity growth. However, because most forecasters expect that the\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunemployment rate will continue to fall – and remain well below the natural rate for some time –\none can reasonably expect further increases in wages and salaries.\nOverall, the data seem quite consistent with labor markets being quite tight. All of the\ndata we have just surveyed – U-3 unemployment below its sustainable rate, historic lows in\ninitial claims, labor flows that avoid spells of unemployment, and gradually rising wages and\nsalaries – are consistent with tight labor markets.\n\nHow Long Will Deviations from the Dual Mandate Persist?\nTurning to the expected longevity of deviations from the dual mandate goals, I would\nfirst acknowledge that these, like all forecasts, are subject to uncertainty. As suggested above, it\nis well-known that forecasts of economic variables have been subject to sizeable errors. Still,\nFOMC participants’ forecasts from the most recent SEP can provide an idea of the expected\nduration of deviations, as well as the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts.\nFigure 8 provides the unemployment forecast from the September SEP. The chart shows\nthat the median forecast for the unemployment rate remains below the Committee’s estimate of\nthe longer-run unemployment rate of 4.6, and continues to do so through 2020. In addition, the\nupper end of the shaded area, which represents the range (or central tendency) of forecasts,\nexcluding the top and bottom three forecasts, also remains below 4.6 through 2020. Clearly,\nFOMC participants expect the unemployment rate gap to be fairly persistent.\nFigure 9 shows similar information for total PCE inflation. The inflation rate closes in\non 2 percent next year, and the median forecast hits 2 percent in 2019. In addition, some\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nmembers of the Committee expect to reach 2 percent in 2018 and to overshoot the target in 2020.\nFigure 10 shows similar information for core PCE inflation, which follows a similar pattern.\nIn summary, the forecasts of FOMC participants imply that the current and expected\ndeviations from the inflation target are likely to be relatively short-lived. However, the\ndeviations of unemployment from its sustainable rate are likely to be persistent. If one assumes\nthese forecasts are reasonable, then the “balanced approach” outlined in the Committee’s\nframework document likely implies a continued gradual removal of accommodation to reach a\nlevel of the federal funds rate that is closer to its longer-run value. Indeed, these forecasts of\ninflation and unemployment deviations generally assume some further increase in interest rates,\nwhich strengthens the case for additional tightening going forward.\n\nAre FOMC Participants Wrong About the Inflation Forecast?\nWhile the forecasts of most participants imply a return to 2 percent, it is possible that\nthese forecasts are based on faulty assumptions about inflation dynamics. If one believes that\ninflation dynamics have changed, one might prefer to wait to learn more about how – and\nperhaps why – inflation will actually evolve.\nOne explanation for persistently low inflation is the role of more globalized markets.\nIncreased competition from abroad might make it difficult for domestic firms to raise prices.\nWhile a significant proportion of the United States economy consists of goods and services that\nare non-tradeable, and thus less subject to such pressures, a significant increase in competition\nfrom abroad could compress margins for those sectors most impacted by foreign competition.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 11 shows the annual imports to the U.S., measured relative to GDP. While there\nwas a large decline in imports relative to GDP as a result of the financial crisis, imports picked\nup in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. However, over the past four years, imports have\nbeen playing a less significant role relative to GDP. The falling share of imports seems to argue\nagainst foreign goods significantly replacing U.S. demand recently.\nAnother reason sometimes cited for changed inflation dynamics is the notion that the\nenhanced competition created by emerging technologies has left firms with no pricing power.\nFigure 12 provides a measure of after-tax corporate profits, after capital consumption and\ninventory valuation adjustments, over the past 50 years. What is striking is how profitable firms\nare now relative to the past, which seems inconsistent with increased competition and a resulting\ninability to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\nAn alternative view is that there have been idiosyncratic price changes that have had the\neffect of artificially lowering measured inflation in a manner which should abate over time.\nFigure 13 shows four Consumer Price Index (CPI) categories – communication, food away from\nhome, rent of primary residence, and owners’ equivalent rent. The communication component of\nthe CPI dropped significantly last spring as a result of changes in wireless pricing that are likely\nto be a one-time event – and thus will not have a persistent effect on inflation.\nThe other three categories in the figure – food away from home, owner’s equivalent rent,\nand rent of primary residence – are areas that have been growing faster than 2 percent. However,\na recent Federal Reserve Bank of Boston policy brief by Luengo-Prado, Rao and Sheremirov\n(2017) indicates that these three sectors have normally grown even faster during periods of tight\nlabor markets. Their work finds evidence of a structural break in the inflation-unemployment\nrelationship described by the Phillips curve. Figure 14 shows their results of running a statistical\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nmodel (more precisely an augmented sectoral Phillips Curve) through the third quarter of 2010\nand then forecasting what would happen to prices if the historical relationship between\nunemployment and sectoral prices was unchanged in the subsequent seven years. 5\nAs shown in Figure 14, on average, inflation readings for the three categories are\nundershooting their historical relationship by about 0.5 percentage points, due to their smaller\nresponse to tight labor markets. It is worth noting that these are not sectors that are likely to be\nparticularly impacted by global pricing pressures or new technologies.\nThus, my own conclusion is that temporarily lower prices in the communication sector –\nalong with the more restrained, but still noticeable, response to low unemployment in these three\nsectors – help explain the recent misses in the Federal Reserve’s inflation target. These findings\nsuggest that while inflation has been low, due to temporary factors, the pattern of observed\ninflation is still consistent with SEP forecasts of a gradual rise toward the 2 percent target in\ncoming quarters.\n\nConcluding Observations\nInflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s target, which might suggest added patience\nin removing accommodation, given that the economy is below the equilibrium rate of interest.\nAt the same time, the unemployment rate is currently below the level most FOMC participants\nthink will be sustainable, which would suggest the additional removal of accommodation. How\nshould the FOMC balance these somewhat conflicting factors? The Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides guidance for following a balanced approach.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nWhile these so-called “misses” in the mandate are of relatively similar magnitudes\ncurrently, most forecasts expect the inflation “miss” to be temporary, but the unemployment\n“miss” to be more persistent. While low inflation allows monetary policymakers to remove\naccommodation gradually, it remains the case – in my view – that a gradual increase in interest\nrates is the balanced approach to reaching both of the Federal Reserve’s mandates in the next\nseveral years.\nWhile it is possible that there is still slack in the economy, most labor market indicators\nseem quite consistent with tight labor markets. While it is also possible that inflation dynamics\nare changing, globalization and technology changes do not seem as compelling an explanation\nfor recent inflation misses as temporary idiosyncratic factors, coupled with a somewhat flatter\nPhillips Curve. This inference is consistent with FOMC participants expecting to see a return to\nthe 2 percent inflation target within the next two years. However, the unemployment rate is\nlikely to remain below its sustainable rate for a good deal longer.\nMy own view is that it is quite likely that unemployment will fall below 4 percent, which\nis likely to increase pressures on inflation and asset prices. In my view, that suggests the need to\ncontinue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation, which is quite consistent with\nmarket expectations of another increase in December.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-fomc.htm.\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve associates a 2 percent level of inflation with price stability and a well-functioning economy.\n\n3\n\nFor additional discussion of what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment, see January 2017 remarks\nby Chair Janet L. Yellen The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them.\n4\n\nThe four-week moving average is used because it can be a noisy series – for example, if disruptions from recent\nhurricanes caused short-term spikes in filing for insurance.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 4:10 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n61st Economic Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 13, 2017\n\nGood morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 61st Economic\nConference. I am very much looking forward to the presentations and discussions over the\ncoming days. Before I begin, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my own,\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nLet me also provide a bit of context for the conference. This year, our conference focuses\non a topic currently debated in Congress but longstanding among economists – whether\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmonetary policy should follow a rules-based approach, or focus on outcomes (like maximum\nsustainable employment and stable prices) and allow policymakers discretion in determining\nhow best to achieve them.\nThis forum continues the Boston Fed’s tradition of examining economic issues and policy\nquestions in a nonpartisan, data-focused way – with an emphasis on actionable issues that can\nimpact the economic well-being of all citizens. Certainly, monetary policy impacts all\nAmericans.\nThe extraordinary measures taken to combat the financial crisis and Great Recession have\nrekindled a longstanding debate: In pursuing the objectives mandated by Congress, is it in the\npublic’s best interest to allow policymakers discretion in setting interest rates, or – as recent\nlegislation would suggest – is macroeconomic performance enhanced if policymakers adhere to a\npredetermined rule, for example, a “Taylor rule,” named after one of our distinguished\nconference presenters, John Taylor.\nThe resolution of the rules vs. discretion debate will have significant consequences. And\na hallmark of the Boston Fed’s economic conference is an engaged consideration of impactful\npolicy topics – monetary or otherwise – encouraging frank discussion and debate. In that spirit,\nover the next day and a half we will grapple with a range of questions central to the rules vs.\ndiscretion debate – and the way forward. My colleagues and I hope this conference provides a\nconstructive forum for the vigorous and balanced consideration of these important issues.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAn Overview of Policy Rules\nPolicy rules have long been central to discussions of monetary policy. I will cover some\nof the positive aspects, as well as some of the drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, rules can capture the response of monetary policy to various\nconditions over a historical period, thus providing an important benchmark and allowing\npolicymakers to compare potential policies to historical norms. What’s more, if the rules capture\nthe central bank’s actual behavior, they can make inherently complex policies more\nunderstandable and transparent to the public. This transparency can also aid in communicating\nthe current and prospective stance of monetary policy – a task that has become more important as\ncommunications operate in real time, around the clock and around the globe, with information\nconstantly processed by financial markets. Finally, such rules can provide more consistency\nthrough time, even as the membership of the central bank’s policymaking committee changes.\nHowever, in my view, policy rules can also have drawbacks. Let me provide one\nexample. Thirty-five years ago, when Frank Morris was president of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston, there was a raging debate underway about monetary policy rules – but they were\ndifferent policy rules than are currently used. At that time, many economists were arguing for\nrules tied to simple money aggregates. Frank was one of the leading voices at that time in\narguing that financial innovation had degraded the information content of money aggregates, and\nas a consequence, simple money-based rules would be poor guides for monetary policy.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I think it is clear that Frank Morris was right: simple\nmoney aggregate rules did not stand the test of time. A review of the recent transcripts of FOMC\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmeetings (released with a five-year lag) – and more recent minutes, public speeches, and\ntestimony – suggests very little time spent discussing monetary aggregates at the FOMC.\nNo simple policy rule has been widely adopted to direct policy at central banks around\nthe world. One reason may be that picking the wrong rule can entail significant costs: an\nineffective or inappropriate rule could produce distinctly sub-optimal results for the economy. It\ncould also be quite costly to a central bank’s reputation and communication efforts if the rule has\nto be abandoned as a consequence.\nMore modern policy rules, as first described by John Taylor in his 1993 and 1999 papers,\nhave significant advantages over simple money aggregate rules, as they are firmly tied to the\nultimate goals that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve (the so-called dual mandate of\nmaximum sustainable employment and price stability) and to which it holds the central bank\naccountable. While the U.S. central bank has independence in how best to achieve these goals,\nthe mandate itself is provided by a democratically-elected government. Thus, a policy rule that\nguides actions (interest rate decisions) to reduce misses in the mandate (deviations of inflation\nand employment from their targets) makes intuitive sense.\nIn my remarks today, I will highlight why I view policy rules tied to the central bank’s\nmandate as extremely useful benchmarks. I will show, using figures from FOMC briefings five\nyears ago that are now publicly available, that FOMC participants do indeed regularly refer to\npolicy rules. However, the key point is that such briefings refer to a variety of policy rules – not\none rule alone – as different policy rules can give very different policy prescriptions. Small\ndeviations in the rule can lead to dramatically different policy outcomes. Of course, the same\nrecord will show that FOMC participants refer to a number of other non-rule benchmarks as\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwell. 1 My view is that it’s not just rule diversity that’s important, but diversity in the overall\npolicy approach that builds in robustness.\nIn sum, I will attempt to document why benchmarking with policy rules is essential – as\nwell as why legislating the use of simple policy rules would, in fact, be quite counterproductive.\n\nPolicy Rules as Helpful Guides\nFigure 1 shows the path of inflation over nearly 50 years. The inflation rate certainly\nappears to behave quite differently prior to 1990 than after, with the earlier period reflecting\nhigher average inflation rates and larger cyclical moves, and the latter period showing less\nvolatility and rates centered around 2 to 3 percent.\nCertainly, this change in inflation dynamics in part reflects central banks’ efforts to fulfill\ntheir key role of ensuring price stability, which has been interpreted by many central banks as\nhaving an inflation target around 2 percent. As central banks have consistently worked to attain\na 2 percent inflation target, inflation expectations have become “well-anchored” around that 2\npercent goal. In fact, one of the major advantages of simple policy rules is that they can\nreinforce the expectations of firms and households that inflation is likely to return to 2 percent in\nthe future.\nFigure 2 shows the unemployment rate over nearly 50 years. Unlike the inflation chart,\nthe broad dynamics of the unemployment rate movements are more consistent over time. One\nregularity of note is that unemployment always falls below its natural rate as the recovery\nmatures, and shortly thereafter rises noticeably above it. While the Federal Reserve’s dual\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmandate involves achieving a low but sustainable unemployment rate, the chart suggests that\nmaintaining a low but sustainable unemployment rate has been quite difficult.\nBecause policy rules that encourage monetary policymakers to move interest rates to\nachieve low sustainable unemployment and price stability are well-aligned with the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate, it is, in fact, quite common for members of the FOMC to use such\npolicy rules as benchmarks. Figure 3 shows the set of policy rules provided during FOMC\nbriefings from 2011, the most recent period for which memos and transcripts are now publicly\navailable. 2 Note that there are several policy rules shown, including John Taylor’s rules from his\n1993 and 1999 papers, as well as other variants commonly used in the literature. The variants of\nthe rules all have the dual mandate embedded in their specifications – that is, deviations from\npotential output (roughly equivalent to full employment) and the inflation target generate a\nprescribed federal funds rate.\nWhile the rules share many common attributes, their modest differences can generate\nvery different interest rate “solutions,” as is shown in the table presented in Figure 4. Note that\nthe interest rate recommended by this set of rules for the second quarter of 2012 ranged from\nnegative 2.15 to positive 0.59. This wide dispersion in policy prescriptions highlights how\nsensitive these models can be to relatively modest modeling differences. A second important\nfeature to note is that all but one rule resulted in a prescription for negative interest rates, with\nthe rule based on John Taylor’s 1999 paper implying an interest rate of -2.15 percent – a rate that\nmight not be feasible in practice, given the powerful incentive it would create for holding cash.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhy a Legislated Rule Would Be Problematic\nSince the Federal Reserve regularly refers to monetary policy rules in its monetary policy\ndeliberations, why not require the Fed to follow a prescribed rule or a rule that it selects? While\nusing rules to capture how the Fed has historically reacted to misses in the mandate is quite\nuseful, as a benchmark, I would argue that rigid adherence to a rule would result in a host of\nproblems.\nFirst, simple interest rate rules do not capture the full range of policy instruments\navailable to the central bank. While some might view this as a positive feature of rules rather\nthan a design flaw, I do not. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has – necessarily, and\nwith positive results – expanded its balance sheet, changed the composition of the balance sheet,\nand changed the duration of the balance sheet.\nFigure 5 shows the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the past 25 years.\nWhile the balance sheet was not used as a policy tool until the Great Recession and its aftermath,\nin my view, the Fed is very likely to need it again in the future, 3 a consequence of living in a\nlow-inflation and low nominal interest rate environment. Policy rules can, and – as seen in\nFigure 4 – actually did, imply negative short-term interest rates. While modestly negative policy\nrates have been used by some central banks, the existence of zero-return cash still makes the use\nof significantly negative policy rates problematic under current institutional arrangements. As a\nresult, rather than adopt negative rates, the Federal Reserve, like many other central banks,\nexpanded its balance sheet when additional accommodation was needed. And – as Figure 6\nshows – the Fed also changed the composition of its balance sheet, increasing the fraction of\nlonger-maturity Treasury securities, and adding government-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOnce short-term interest rates had reached the effective lower bound, these actions were\nundertaken to lower longer-term interest rates so as to provide additional macroeconomic\nstimulus, consistent with the negative-rate signals being sent by many simple policy rules. These\nactions seem to have flattened the Treasury yield curve and reduced interest rates relative to the\nTreasury yield curve.\nUnfortunately, as I have noted in the past, low productivity, low population growth, and\nlow inflation targets imply low equilibrium nominal interest rates. As a result, it is quite likely in\nmy view that short-term interest rates may again hit the effective lower bound in future\nrecessions – again necessitating policy tools not currently captured in most simple policy rules.\nA second problem I see is that parameters often specified as constants in simple policy\nrules have proven to be quite variable. For example, in many formulations of simple policy\nrules, the equilibrium real interest rate is set as a constant. However, Figure 7 shows that the\nFOMC members have been reducing their estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate\nquite significantly. (This reflects changes in policymakers’ views of the rate that would be\nconsistent with no change in inflation and unemployment.) Instead of being constant, their\nestimates have moved – and moved enough to significantly alter the expected number of quarterpoint increases required to reach the “normal” or equilibrium rate.\nAnother parameter that is often viewed as a constant in simple policy rules is the estimate\nof full employment or potential output. Figure 8 shows that FOMC participants have moved\ntheir estimates of full employment quite significantly. While I have argued elsewhere that these\nestimates may move too much, even more modest changes would imply significant deviations\nfrom a policy rule that assumed the natural unemployment rate was a constant.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nProposed legislation covering monetary policy rules requires explanations, which can be\naudited, for any deviations in the proposed rule – or deviations from the prescriptions of the rule.\nHowever, Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate why such explanations might be needed at many\nFOMC meetings, given the changing views of economic relationships as we get more\ninformation about how the economy is actually responding. And because such explanations\nwould involve estimates of inherently unobservable concepts that are subject to significant\nuncertainty, one can imagine that discussion around these explanations could become quite\ncomplicated.\nFigure 9 shows how the actual interest rate prescription emanating from a particular rule\nwould change given variation in key values – specifically, if one used values for full employment\n(the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU) and the equilibrium real rate of\ninterest that reflect the variation over the past five years in FOMC participants’ median estimates\nin the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. The first line examines the past five\nyears using John Taylor’s 1993 rule with an estimate of a real interest rate of 2.25 percent and a\nNAIRU of 5.45 percent, similar to the assumptions in the January 2012 SEP. The second line\nuses a 1993 Taylor rule with a 0.75 percent estimate of the equilibrium real rate of interest and a\nNAIRU of 4.6 percent, similar to the estimates from the September 2017 SEP. 4 The two lines\nare quite different, using the same rule but different estimates of the real equilibrium interest rate\nand NAIRU – reflecting the actual estimates of FOMC participants over the past five years.\nNote that the differences in the two lines are material, in the context of monetary policy\ndecisions.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDo Simple Policy Rules Capture Actual Policy Reaction?\nFigure 10 shows errors in estimating the 1993 Taylor rule, with recession shading and\nlines tied to various periods of financial instability. The chart shows that the simple 1993 Taylor\nrule does not do a particularly good job of tracking how the FOMC actually moved the federal\nfunds rate, particularly during periods of financial instability. In a paper I wrote with Joe Peek\nand Geoff Tootell, 5 we analyzed how policy reacts not only to inflation and unemployment, but\nto financial stability concerns, as reflected in mentions of financial stability in the FOMC\ntranscripts. 6 The paper more rigorously shows that concerns about financial stability, which are\nnot modeled in the Taylor rule, are reflected in FOMC actions.\nThis reflects differences in how FOMC participants think about variables that the rules,\nand rules legislation, treat as constants or are not included at all. It also possibly reflects the use\nof different weights on inflation and unemployment rate misses, and the use of forecasts rather\nthan outcomes. But it also reflects the fact that, in practice, the Federal Reserve reacts to\nfinancial stability shocks.\nThe leading example for this point is the last financial crisis. In 2007, the actual federal\nfunds rate decreased much sooner than would have been implied by the 1993 Taylor rule. In the\ncase of 2007, a much slower reaction to the impending financial problems would have\nexacerbated what was already a very serious economic downturn.\nThe failure to incorporate financial stability, or anything that reflects “tail risks” rather\nthan expected outcomes, will not fully capture how policymakers react in real time. During\nrecessions and financial crises, this can be a significant omission.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:35 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Friday, October 13, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nSimple policy rules are useful for many reasons, not least of which is in capturing how\nmonetary policy has reacted historically. This makes these rules very useful benchmarks,\nproviding useful guidance on how current policymakers are acting relative to how earlier FOMC\nparticipants reacted to misses on inflation and full employment.\nHowever, a legislated policy rule that is rigid could lead to large policy mistakes, as key\ninputs to policy rules that can change over time are estimated with substantial error. From my\nperspective, policy effectiveness will be better served, instead, by a more robust formulation of\nmonetary policy that draws on a diverse set of guidelines and benchmarks – which is the exercise\nFed policymakers conduct every six weeks for actual FOMC meetings.\nThank you, and again I extend a warm welcome to all of you participating in the\nconference.\n\n1\n\nSuch as: a variety of optimal policy simulations, equilibrium real rate comparisons, and alternative scenarios.\n\n2\n\nFor more information on the historical use of monetary policy rules, see:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf .\n\n3\n\nFor additional perspective on use of the Federal Reserve balance sheet as a monetary policy tool, see April 2017\nremarks by Eric S.

Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Estimating Key Economic Variables:\nthe Policy Implications”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n84th International Atlantic Economic Conference\nInternational Atlantic Economic Society\nMontreal, Canada\nOctober 7, 2017\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be with you in Montreal. I’d like to thank the\nInternational Atlantic Economic Society for inviting me to share my views on the economy\ntoday. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nEvery economic recovery has its own unique puzzles. Certainly, one puzzle in the most\nrecent recovery is why it has been so difficult for central banks in many developed economies to\nachieve their inflation objectives, even as employment has rebounded. Both Japan and the\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUnited States are at or beyond many estimates of full employment, and the Euro Area has made\nsignificant progress toward full employment – and yet, inflation in all three areas remains below\ntargets set by their respective central banks. One would expect robust employment conditions to\nnudge up wages and in turn prices, leading the inflation rate towards its target.\nOne possible explanation for this puzzle could be that what economists call the “natural\nrate” of unemployment – the unemployment rate that is consistent with an inflation rate at its\ntarget value – may have fallen. A lower natural rate of unemployment in the economy might\nexplain why lower actual levels of unemployment are not driving up wages and prices as quickly\nas some have expected. In fact, Federal Reserve policymakers – the participants in the FOMC –\nhave lowered their estimates of the unemployment rate that they expect in the long run.\nWhile it is certainly possible that the natural rate of unemployment for the U.S. economy\nis now lower, I believe some caution is in order in making this assessment. Short-run estimates\nof the natural rate have tended to follow the actual unemployment rate fairly closely; hence,\npolicymakers’ estimates of full employment1 tend to be lower when the economy is doing well\nand higher when the economy is doing less well. But with the benefit of hindsight, estimates of\nthe natural rate are less variable than initially thought, tracking actual unemployment less\nclosely.2\nModest and gradual movements in the natural rate are consistent with the sense that longterm economic trends, such as improvement in human capital and demographic changes, are the\nmain source of variation in the natural rate. Such changes are unlikely to occur quickly or in\nunexpected ways over relatively short time periods, such as over a business cycle.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSo, since I do not believe a significant decline in the natural rate of unemployment\nexplains the subdued-inflation puzzle, it remains just that – a puzzle.\nA second surprise in this recovery has been the relatively slow rate of economic growth\nwe have experienced in the U.S., despite unusually low interest rates. While short-term real\ninterest rates have actually been negative throughout the recovery – clearly, very accommodative\nmonetary conditions – the economy has still grown at a rather tepid rate of about 2 percent. A\ncommon explanation for this dynamic has been that the equilibrium interest rate – the interest\nrate that in the long run is consistent with stable inflation and full employment – has fallen.\nIn this case, the movement does seem more understandable. What policymakers call\n“potential GDP growth” has declined. Indeed, FOMC participants are surveyed on their views of\nwhat the long-run sustainable interest rate, and GDP growth rate, will be in the longer term – and\nboth estimates have fallen quite substantially.\nHowever, like the natural rate of unemployment, the equilibrium interest rate can only be\ninferred, rather than known. The rapid decline in estimates of the equilibrium interest rate\nshould also be viewed cautiously, given the imprecision in estimation – and given how much\nestimates have varied over a relatively short time period.\nThe relatively rapid changes in these estimates of variables like the natural rate of\nunemployment and the equilibrium interest rate may of course reflect actual changes in\neconomic relationships. However, they also may attempt to explain developments in “high\nfrequency” information with changes in relatively “low frequency concepts,” and stretch too far\nin attempting to explain developments in economic measures. While attempting to infer possible\nlong-run changes or implications from recent high frequency data may be reasonable, history\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshows that policymakers tend to place too much weight on short-term fluctuations in their realtime estimates of long-run concepts.\nThis tendency is of more than academic interest. One can make significant policy\nmistakes if one assumes incorrectly that significant changes in long-run variables have occurred,\nwhen in fact no change has occurred.3 Central bankers should hesitate to change their policy\nstance based on estimated changes in long-run variables that in statistical terms are not large,\nrelative to the standard errors with which these quantities are estimated.\nIn my own view, maintaining negative real short-term rates once we have achieved full\nemployment risks the potential of an eventual overheating of the economy, which could be\nreflected in higher wages and prices, or higher asset prices. Already-tight labor markets are\nlikely to tighten further as the economy continues to grow faster than its potential. In these\ncircumstances, prudent risk management would argue for the continued gradual removal of\nmonetary policy accommodation in order to minimize the risk of outcomes that might\nprematurely shorten the current economic recovery.\n\nRecovery Puzzles\nIt is not particularly surprising that the economic recovery, in the wake of a financial\ncrisis, has been quite slow. Studies of earlier episodes find that recoveries following financial\ncrises are usually slow – as firms and households are understandably more risk averse, and the\ncollateral values that are essential for obtaining financing are slow to rebound. However, what\nhas been more surprising is how slowly wages and prices are growing a decade after the onset of\nthe Great Recession.4\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 1 shows the unemployment rate in the United States, the Euro Area, and Japan.\nBy this measure, there has been significant improvement in all three economies. In both the U.S.\nand Japan, unemployment rates are now below levels reported immediately prior to the Great\nRecession. In the case of the Euro Area, the unemployment rate is still elevated, but is on a path\nreflecting relatively consistent improvement.\nIn contrast, Figure 2 shows that the progress on achieving stated inflation targets has\nbeen somewhat disappointing. In all three regions, inflation rates are currently below their 2\npercent targets. While there have been periods during the recovery when measures of total\ninflation have temporarily exceeded 2 percent, the inflation rate has remained below target for\nmuch of the recovery. For example, the total PCE inflation rate in the U.S. over the last year has\nmost recently averaged only 1.4 percent. In Japan, the inflation rate has been particularly low,\npossibly reflecting a fall in the expected inflation rate due to the very long period when actual\ninflation has been below the 2 percent target.\n\nOne Puzzle: Implications of Low Inflation\nDuring periods of substantial slack in the economy, it is not surprising that wage and\nprice inflation are modest. However, as we reach or exceed many economists’ estimates of full\nemployment, one might expect that wage and price pressures would gradually increase. One\nway that economists try to capture this relationship is through the Phillips Curve, which\ndescribes inflation as being generated by expectations of future inflation and the amount of\nlabor-market slack in the economy. One challenge of this simple formulation involves how best\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nto capture the amount of slack in the economy. The measurement of slack depends on obtaining\nan estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.5\nFigure 3 provides estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and forecasts of the\nunemployment rate in the longer run. The dark blue line is the median of FOMC policymaker\nestimates of the unemployment rate in the longer run, from the Federal Reserve’s Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP). Since this is a survey, the estimates reflect what participants knew\nas of the time of the survey. Participants are asked the unemployment rate they expect in the\nlonger run, assuming an absence of shocks and assuming appropriate monetary policy. A second\nmeasure – the green line – is the current Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate of the\nnatural rate over the same time period. Since the financial crisis, the median estimate of FOMC\nparticipants has moved from a high of 5.45 percent, to the current low of 4.6 percent. The\nshaded region provides the SEP “central tendency,” the range of estimates provided by FOMC\nparticipants after excluding the three highest and three lowest responses. At times, even though\nthe range is quite large, the bottom of the range lies above the CBO estimate of full employment,\nas it does from mid-2011 through 2015.\nHow reasonable are the estimates of the natural rate? The range of estimates highlights\nthe uncertainty entailed in measuring this key variable. While the natural rate will change over\ntime, most of those changes reflect gradual but significant changes in demographic\ncharacteristics of the labor force. For example, when (typically) younger workers first enter the\nworkforce, they are more likely to be unemployed, as they may not as yet have developed\nmarketable skills, and are thus more likely to shift jobs. In addition, they are more likely to leave\nthe workforce to gain additional skills through higher education or training. The opposite is true\nof more experienced and older workers, who have developed job-specific capital and are\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntherefore more attached to their work and less likely to become unemployed or leave the labor\nforce. So historically, when demographics have resulted in a higher share of younger workers in\nthe labor force, the natural rate appears to have risen – relative to times when young workers are\na smaller share of the labor force.\nFigure 4 shows the share of the labor force between the ages of 16 and 24 and the CBO’s\nestimate of the natural rate of long-term unemployment. The chart shows that with the aging of\nthe baby boom generation, younger workers have become a relatively smaller share of the labor\nforce. And, at the same time, the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate has declined.\nFigure 5 provides the share of the labor force – age 25 years and older – with at least a\ncollege degree, which has trended up over time. Better educated workers tend to have lower\nunemployment rates when compared with those with less educational attainment. As a result,\none might expect this trend to be reflected in a lower natural rate of unemployment.\nWhile these figures provide possible explanations for why the natural rate may change, it\nis important to realize that broad demographic trends are generally slow moving, well-known in\nadvance, and thus straightforward to predict. While these trends can make a difference and do\nseem consistent with the moves seen in the CBO estimate of the natural rate, it is hard to match\nthese broader demographic changes with relatively rapid and recent changes in the estimates of\nthe natural rate seen in the SEP forecasts.\nAn alternative explanation of the degree of movement in the presumed natural rate may\nbe that forecasters are overly sensitive to current economic conditions when estimating the\ncurrent natural rate. When the unemployment rate is quite high, we may associate too much of\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe higher unemployment rate to difficulties in matching workers to jobs. Similarly, when labor\nmarkets are very tight, as is the case presently, estimates of the natural rate may fall too much.\nFigure 6 shows the actual unemployment rate with the median SEP estimate of the\nnatural rate, and the CBO estimate of the natural rate since mid-2014. The actual unemployment\nrate is now below both estimates of the natural rate – and estimates of the natural rate are now\nlower than they were just three years ago. The SEP estimates, reflecting real-time estimates of\nthe natural rate, move more closely with actual unemployment than the CBO estimate, which has\nthe benefit of hindsight. This suggests exercising caution in making our natural rate estimate too\nresponsive to incoming data.6\n\nA Second Puzzle: The Low Equilibrium Rate of Interest\nA second foundational concept that is difficult to estimate is the “normal” level for the\nfederal funds rate – or what policymakers call the equilibrium nominal interest rate. As with the\nnatural unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate is a concept that cannot be directly\nobserved, but must be estimated. Also similar to the natural rate, a good proxy for estimates by\nFOMC members of the equilibrium funds rate is their SEP estimates for the nominal federal\nfunds rate “in the longer run.”\nFigure 7 provides the SEP forecasts since 2012. While the funds rate in the longer run\nwas estimated at 4.25 percent early in the recovery, the estimate in the most recent SEP had\nfallen to 2.75 percent. Like the natural rate, there is significant variation in these estimates over\ntime, as well as significant disagreement among SEP participants at any point in time. As the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshaded region shows, the lower boundary of the central tendency of the estimates of the\nequilibrium interest rate early in the sample are well above most estimates just a few years later.\nAs with the natural rate, there are good reasons to expect the equilibrium interest rate to\nchange over time. In fact, in this case the level may actually be more responsive to current\neconomic data. If we think of the interest rate as determined by the balance between savings and\ninvestment, then changes in the equilibrium interest rate will occur when the key factors\ndetermining aggregate saving and investment decisions change. These include demographic\nchanges, which can affect global saving behavior (generally younger workers save less, older\nworkers save more), and changes in productivity, which affect the demand for investment goods\n(higher productivity generally spurs investment, as it implies higher returns per dollar spent on\ninvested goods). Increases in the propensity to save will place downward pressure on\nequilibrium interest rates, as the higher demand for saving implies a lower required interest rate.\nIn this case, one might expect to see more significant changes as, for example, variables\nthat impact aggregate savings and investment can change. In fact, SEP participants’ estimates of\nthe equilibrium interest rate have fallen significantly over a relatively short period of time.\nWhile there may be more responsiveness to incoming economic data, and changes like much\nlower current estimates of productivity should impact this calculation, one should be cautious\ngiven the inherent difficulty in inferring where the equilibrium interest rate will be in the long\nrun.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile it is important that monetary policy be “data dependent,” it is equally important\nthat it not be too sensitive to incoming data – especially when estimating important underlying\neconomic concepts like the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium interest rate.\nWhile underlying economic relationships can and do change, one should not be too quick to\nassume that relationships are unhinged as a result of expectation errors for “high frequency”\ndata. It is certainly important to adjust estimates of underlying relationships when there are large\npersistent variations from estimated values, but too much sensitivity to incoming data can cause\nmonetary policy to be too easy in expansions and too slow to respond to recessions.\nIn the current environment, the low inflation readings have provided monetary\npolicymakers the opportunity to take a more patient approach to removing accommodation than\nin recent recoveries, allowing a prolonged period of recovery in labor markets. A gradual\napproach has many benefits, including the possibility of a long sustained recovery without\nrisking a significant over-reaction by monetary policymakers.\nHowever, estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and the equilibrium interest rate\ncan be too low as well as too high. In my own view, failing to respond to very tight labor\nmarkets with rates remaining negative in real terms could potentially risk unnecessarily\nshortening the economic recovery, as rising inflation or an episode of financial instability\neventually causes monetary policymakers to have to act more forcefully.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThat is, of the level of unemployment associated with full employment in the economy.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, October 7, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n2\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study, Changing Labor Force Composition and the Natural Rate of\nUnemployment, by Daniel Aaronson, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G. Sullivan.\n3\n\nFor example, if central bankers had assumed in 2010 that the natural rate of unemployment had risen toward 9\npercent, they would have been incorrect, as the data since then has shown.\n4\n\nFor additional perspective on the economic recovery in the wake of the financial crisis, see October 2016 remarks\nby Eric S. Rosengren, After the Great Recession, a Not-So-Great Recovery.\n5\n\nA common concept of slack employed in this context is the amount of labor market slack, usually taken as the\ndifference between the actual unemployment rate and the rate that is consistent with full employment, called the\nnatural rate. When unemployment is at the natural rate, the labor market does not exert pressure to move the\ninflation rate away from the central bank’s goal for inflation (2 percent in the U.S.). Thus, this definition of slack\ndepends on obtaining an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, a well-defined but difficult-to-measure\nquantity.\n6\n\nSuch movements in the estimates of an important underlying variable for measuring tightness in the labor market\nhighlight that estimates can be too sensitive to recent underlying data. The CBO estimate of the natural rate tends to\nmove only gradually, consistent with slow moving demographic variables, while the SEP estimates move much\nmore. This suggests some caution in being too sensitive to incoming data relative to economic relationships that\ngenerally are believed to move only slowly.\n\n11\n\n\f",

U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Trends and Transitory Shocks”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Money Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nGood evening. It is a pleasure to be back in New York. I’d like to thank the Money\nMarketeers for inviting me to share my perspectives this evening. At the outset, let me note as I\nalways do that the views I express are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAfter last week’s FOMC meeting, the Committee announced that it would begin to shrink\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in October. In my view, this was a well-communicated\nannouncement designed to minimize any disruption – which was advisable, given that there is no\nprecedent for the process of shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet, at least at this magnitude.\nThe announcement went smoothly, and now with the balance sheet essentially on “automatic\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npilot,” Federal Reserve policymakers can resume using short-term interest rates as the primary\ntool for monetary policy.\nAs policymakers think about appropriate policy, it should be noted that discerning the\nunderlying trends in unemployment and inflation – looking through transitory effects – is likely\nto be quite difficult in coming months. The impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria will\nsignificantly cloud the interpretation of the economic data. The challenge will be in trying to\ndifferentiate the temporary — the pause and rebound in activity resulting from the storms and\nsubsequent rebuilding — from the ongoing trend. Thus, it may be difficult to be fully “data\ndependent” in the near-term. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate indicators – employment and inflation – are sending somewhat\nconflicting signals of late: labor markets have continued to improve, yet inflation has slipped\ndown a notch this year.\nFor much of the period of recovery from the financial crisis and last recession, inflation\nwas well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, and the unemployment rate was well\nabove the estimated long-run sustainable rate. Today, while inflation is still undershooting the\nFed’s 2 percent target, the unemployment rate has declined so much that it is actually below\nwhat most FOMC participants see as the sustainable level of the unemployment rate (and, as I\nwill note in a moment, it is likely to fall further).\nWhen the central bank’s dual mandate is “dueling,” how should policymakers resolve the\nconflicting signals? Monetary policy must be forward looking, so a key consideration involves\nthe likelihood that the mandate “misses” will persist. Peering into the future is always fraught\nwith uncertainty; but even so, it may be instructive to consider where most private sector\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neconomists and policymakers believe that inflation and unemployment are headed over the\nmedium-term. Do they see recent inflation weakness as temporary, or a sign of things to come?\nAs I will discuss today, the forecasts of both Federal Reserve policymakers (in the\nSummary of Economic Projections or SEP1) and private forecasters agree that by the end of next\nyear, inflation is expected to be close to target while the unemployment rate will continue to fall\n– and as a result, will move further below most estimates of a sustainable unemployment rate.\nI share this forecast, and the assessment that unemployment will be materially below\nmost policymakers’ estimates of the rate consistent with full employment. The likelihood of this\noutcome poses risks – specifically that an overheated economy will lead to price or asset-price\ninflation, risking the sustainability of the recovery. The last time we had unemployment rates\ntrending toward 4 percent (in the late 1990s), the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\nmeasure of total inflation and asset prices had begun to rise, followed shortly thereafter by an\neconomic downturn and a significant revaluation in many asset prices. Thus, in my view,\nappropriate risk mitigation would argue for continued gradual removal of monetary\naccommodation, even though we are currently below the inflation target.\n\nAre Recent Low Inflation Rates Likely to be Transitory?\nFigure 1 provides the total and core PCE inflation measures over the past three years.\nWhile the total PCE inflation rate briefly exceeded the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target early this\nyear, it has since fallen, and the total PCE inflation rate – the percent change in the index from a\nyear ago – is currently 1.4 percent.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn part, the decline is due to some idiosyncratic individual price decreases. Reductions in\nwireless phone plan prices and lower prescription drug prices both resulted in declines in the\nPCE inflation rate this spring. And – as a matter of arithmetic – these drops will continue to\ndepress 12-month inflation rates until next spring. However, the effects of the hurricanes will\nlikely cause temporary increases in reported inflation over the next several months. The\nhurricanes have disrupted refinery and distribution facilities, temporarily elevating gasoline\nprices, for example. Of course, as this capacity comes back on line, gasoline prices will likely\nfall back to their pre-hurricane levels, imposing another downward imprint on inflation. The\npoint is that additional “noise” in the data will make it a bit more difficult in the near term to\ndetermine the underlying trend in inflation, at a time when policymakers are eager to distinguish\nthe trend from the noise given the recent low readings.\nFigure 2 provides the median forecast for PCE inflation at yearend 2018 from the past\nfive SEP reports. The central tendency is defined as the range of forecasts excluding the three\nhighest and three lowest forecasts. The median forecast, which had been quite constant at 2\npercent, has edged down in the most recent SEP. The fact that the median has dipped below 2\npercent and the bottom of the shaded area now extends a bit lower suggests that some FOMC\nparticipants believe we will still remain below the target at the end of 2018. Nonetheless, I\nwould point out that even the lower boundary of the central tendency, at 1.8 percent, is still\nrelatively close to the 2 percent target.\nFigure 3 provides the median forecast and the central tendency for core PCE inflation.\nThe overall forecast for core PCE inflation is generally consistent with that of total inflation.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 4 turns from Fed policymakers to those private forecasters taking part in the Blue\nChip consensus forecast. It provides the consensus (average) forecast and the average of the 10\nhighest and 10 lowest forecasts for PCE inflation for Blue Chip participants.2 The private\nforecasts are generally consistent with the SEP, but the chart shows that, unlike the FOMC\nparticipants, at least some private forecasters believe inflation will be above the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target by the end of next year.\nOverall, there is a broad consistency between FOMC participants’ forecasts and privatesector forecasts. The current low inflation readings are viewed as transitory by both. While such\nforecasts are still of course subject to errors – possibly even significant ones – I believe\npolicymakers should not overreact to low current inflation readings that are widely expected to\nbe temporary.\n\nIs the Decline in the Unemployment Rate Expected to be Transitory?\nFigure 5 provides the recent unemployment rate and a horizontal line at 4.7 percent\nunemployment, marking my estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate or the rate\nconsistent with full employment. The unemployment rate fell below my 4.7 percent estimate\nearlier this spring, and is currently 4.4 percent. A small and temporary movement below the\nsustainable unemployment rate is unlikely to have much impact on wages and prices – so again,\nwe need to explore whether low and falling unemployment should be viewed as a temporary or\npersistent phenomenon.\nFigure 6 addresses this question by showing the median unemployment rate forecast for\nthe end of 2018 by FOMC participants, along with the central tendency. The chart shows that\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nboth the median and the central tendency of forecasts for the unemployment rate at the end of\n2018 have been declining. While the bottom of the central tendency has settled at 4 percent in\nthe two most recent forecasts, the bottom of the full range (including the three lowest\nsubmissions) has declined to 3.9 percent, indicating some FOMC participants now expect the\nunemployment rate to decline below 4 percent, even with the modest rise in interest rates.\nFigure 7 shows that the Blue Chip forecast of private forecasters is quite similar. The\nBlue Chip consensus forecast now has the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 percent, with the\naverage of the lowest 10 forecasts now at 3.8 percent. The number of forecasters who believe\nunemployment will stabilize at 4.4 percent or rise from there is quite small. Thus, forecasters\ngenerally see the recent low readings for unemployment as persistent, and they envision\nadditional declines on average. This is just the opposite of their views on inflation.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Falling Significantly Below the Full Employment Level\nFigure 8 shows the actual unemployment rate, relative to FOMC participants’ median\nestimate of the unemployment rate that is likely to be sustainable in the long run. As you can\nsee, it is only recently that the quarterly unemployment rate has fallen below the estimates of the\nsustainable unemployment rate. With the unemployment rate currently at 4.4 percent and the\nmedian estimate of full employment at 4.6, we are currently 0.2 percentage points below the\nmedian of what FOMC participants believe to be sustainable – and as I have mentioned, that gap\nis expected to grow as unemployment falls further. Notably, this has occurred despite a gradual\ndecline in the level that FOMC participants consider sustainable.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 9 shows the SEP forecast of the unemployment rate made in September 2014,3\nalong with the actual path of unemployment. The forecast assumed that the unemployment rate\nwould fall more slowly than it actually did. While undershooting the unemployment forecast is\npositive when trying to reach full employment, such misses are less desirable if they push the\neconomy well beyond full employment.\nFigure 10 shows two measures of wage pressures – average hourly earnings, and the\nwages and salaries component of the employment cost index excluding incentive paid\noccupations. While we have only recently fallen below the SEP median estimate of sustainable\nunemployment, we can see that wages and salaries have been trending up over the past several\nyears. Both measures were below 2 percent in 2012 and have gradually risen to approximately\n2.5 percent more recently. An open question is how much employers and employees will alter\nwage and salary expectations in increasingly tight labor markets.\nFigure 11 displays the Blue Chip forecast, as of this month, for growth in average hourly\nearnings. As mentioned earlier, the Blue Chip consensus forecast has the unemployment rate\ncontinuing to trend down. The consensus forecast anticipates that average hourly earnings\ngrowth will continue to increase, and reach 3.0 percent by the end of 2018. It is worth noting\nthat average hourly earnings growth is currently 2.5 percent, and the average of the bottom ten\nforecasters is 2.7 percent for the end of 2018. This indicates that almost all the Blue Chip\nforecasters are expecting acceleration from current levels.\nOne way that wage pressures can build is if workers are willing to leave their current job\nfor a higher-paying one. As Figure 12 shows, very few workers were willing to leave their jobs\nin the wake of the Great Recession. However, as labor markets have tightened, workers are\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshowing a greater willingness to leave their jobs in pursuit of better opportunities. With the socalled “quits rate” now close to the peak prior to the Great Recession, workers appear to be quite\nwilling to leave their current jobs in search of higher wages.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe weakness in inflation readings appears to be transitory, but some one-time declines\nin individual prices will not fall out of annual averages until next spring. In contrast, the recent\nhurricanes will likely place some upward pressure on measured inflation over the next several\nmonths, a transitory shock in the other direction. However, the declines in the unemployment\nrate below the level most see as sustainable seem likely to be more long-lasting, which is one\nreason for my expectation that tight – and tightening further – labor markets will result in higher\nwages and prices over time.\nTemporary fluctuations in prices may obscure the underlying trend for a little while. But\nmonetary policy tends to act with long lags, so it is essential that central bankers do their best to\nlook through the temporary toward the underlying trends. Those trends, as best I can see them at\npresent, suggest to me an economy that risks pushing past what is sustainable, raising the\nprobability of higher asset prices, or inflation well above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nSteps lowering the probability of such an outcome seem advisable – in other words, seem like\ninsurance worth taking out at this time. As a result, it is my view that regular and gradual\nremoval of monetary accommodation seems appropriate.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce\nand the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce\nSouth Burlington, Vermont\nMay 10, 2017\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Exploring the Economy’s Recent Progress, and the\nImplications for Policy”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce\nand the Central Vermont Chamber of Commerce\nSouth Burlington, Vermont\nMay 10, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be back in Vermont, and to be able to provide an\nupdate on the economic outlook. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board\nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nI increasingly hear from business leaders about a shortage of qualified workers –\nparticularly here in northern New England, where unemployment rates are now at or below 3\npercent. This is, of course, a welcome change from 2008 and the years that followed, when far\ntoo many workers experienced great difficulty finding jobs. But my primary message today is\nabout the importance of achieving positive, but long-run sustainable, economic conditions – full\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemployment and stable prices (which the Federal Reserve defines as 2 percent inflation) – and,\nby extension, that monetary policy supports such an outcome.\nBefore I turn to these issues, I would highlight that economic data for the first quarter\nhave been weaker than many expected. As the FOMC statement released last week1 suggested,\nand in my own view as well, this is probably a temporary lull – and it is likely that the economy\nwill grow at an average somewhat above 2 percent for the rest of this year.\nOne reason is that much of the weakness in the first quarter was related to consumption,\nyet personal income and wealth have continued to rise, and consumer confidence indices remain\nquite positive. So my expectation is that consumption will re-emerge in the second quarter and\nwe will continue to have a consumption-led recovery.\nThe employment report for April was also published last Friday. Payroll employment\nbounced back from March, with 211,000 new jobs – and the unemployment rate was reported as\n4.4 percent nationally, which is below my estimate of full employment in the longer run (4.7\npercent). In addition, the broader U-6 measure of unemployment (which takes into account\nmarginal attachment to the labor force and employment that is part time for economic reasons),\ndeclined to 8.6 percent – a new low for this recovery.\nAll in all, I do not regard the weakness in first quarter data as a harbinger of softness in\nthe underlying economy, and the strength of the labor market report on Friday provides some\nstrong confirmation of that view. With real GDP growth in the remainder of the year likely to\nexceed 2 percent, and robust labor markets, and measures of inflation near 2 percent, I think it is\nimportant that the Federal Reserve continue to gradually normalize interest rates, and also to\nbegin to normalize the central bank’s balance sheet. Doing so, I believe, is the best way to help\nthe economy remain on a sustainable path.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSome of the downside risks that observers have cited – such as relatively slow loan\ngrowth, and weakness in the economies of foreign trading partners – do not seem to me\ncompelling reasons to slow down the gradual normalization of monetary policy. I will return to\nthese topics in a moment, but let me share my overall view that it is important to avoid creating\nan over-hot economy (one that could require a less gradual monetary policy adjustment). And in\norder to avoid doing so, the Federal Reserve should continue gradually normalizing monetary\npolicy. This would imply beginning a very gradual reduction of securities held on the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet relatively soon, while continuing to use short-term interest rates as the\nprimary monetary policy tool for maintaining sustainable growth – growth that is consistent with\nthe Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.\n\nGrowth Likely to Exceed Potential\nWith real GDP growth averaging just over 2 percent during the recovery – which is\nmodest by historical standards – labor markets have nonetheless become tight. For the\nunemployment rate to steadily fall even with such restrained growth rates implies that the socalled potential growth rate for the economy is now below 2 percent (given that the\nunemployment rate falls when actual economic growth exceeds potential).2\nFigure 1 provides a chart showing Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of\npotential growth, as well as population growth, by decade. In the 1980s and 1990s, the CBO\nestimated that potential growth was over 3 percent, while their estimate for this decade is well\nbelow 2 percent.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA number of factors explain the downward trend in potential GDP, which is determined\nby the number of available workers and the amount of output that each worker produces.\nSlowing population growth accounts for some of the decline, as does slowing labor force growth,\nwhich has been affected by the baby boomers retiring and leaving the labor force. Another\nfactor behind the slowdown in potential GDP growth has been productivity. Most measures of\nproductivity growth have been declining, so that there is less growth in goods and services per\nunit of labor. Given these developments in population growth, labor force, and productivity, my\nown estimate of potential growth is 1.75 percent.\nFigure 2 shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for real GDP through 2018, as of May.\nBlue Chip provides forecasts based on a survey of roughly 50 private-sector forecasters. Their\nconsensus projection has growth more than half a percentage point higher than my estimate of\nthe potential rate. As I suggested a moment ago, growth in excess of potential would likely have\nthe effect of further tightening labor markets. The green dotted border indicates the average of\nthe 10 highest and 10 lowest estimates for real GDP. Note that nearly all of the shaded region\nexceeds the 1.75 percent estimate of the potential growth rate.\nFigure 3 shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for the unemployment rate. Consistent\nwith their real GDP forecast, most Blue Chip forecasters expect the unemployment rate to\ncontinue to trend down. It is worth noting that the average of the 10 highest forecasts is only 4.7\npercent unemployment, which is also my estimate of the full employment level, at the outset of\nthe forecast period. For most of the forecast period, the average of the 10 highest forecasts is just\n4.6 percent. The shaded region between the 10 highest and 10 lowest forecasts lies entirely\nbelow my estimate of full employment. The average of the 10 lowest forecasts for\nunemployment falls to 4 percent by the end of 2017 and falls below 4 percent in 2018. Such low\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment rates would likely cause increased pressure on wages and prices, and signal an\neconomy on a pace exceeding its sustainable level.\nIn sum, most forecasters are expecting growth above potential and unemployment below\nthe full-employment level. This would represent an unsustainable, “overshooting” pace – and\nprovides an important rationale for continuing the process of normalization of monetary policy\nthat is currently underway.\n\nPotential Risks to the Forecast\nOne concern that has been raised about the robustness of the recovery involves the\ngrowth rate of bank loans, shown in Figure 4. The growth in bank loans has been less rapid than\nin earlier recoveries, and one can look at both demand and supply issues for explanations. One\nreason for the relatively slow growth is that, in the wake of the Great Recession, many firms and\nhouseholds sought to decrease their debt burden – which resulted in a depressed demand for\nloans. In addition, many firms – if they survived the recession – found themselves with impaired\nbalance sheets that made them less able or qualified to borrow. Turning to issues with the supply\nof loans, I would note that historically, recoveries characterized by weak initial lending also were\nperiods where a large number of financial institutions became troubled. To maintain capital-toassets ratios after losses – say in commercial real estate – financial intermediaries have pared\nback lending (because loans are assets for banks).\nWhile loan growth has been slower than in other recoveries, Figure 5 provides some\ncontext for the recent growth in total and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans held by banks.\nLoan growth for 2016 exceeded 5 percent, a pace faster than the growth in nominal GDP.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn addition, it is important to note that bank loan growth can understate overall credit\ngrowth, because many firms with access to capital markets satisfied their borrowing needs\nthrough bond issuance, taking advantage of the historically low interest rates and locking in low,\nlong-term rates. Figure 6 shows the gross issuance of investment grade nonfinancial corporate\nbonds. Issuance has grown and remains robust. I would also note that increasingly, smaller\nfirms have alternatives to banks to meet their financial needs. Many smaller firms are turning to\nnon-bank lenders and “fintech” companies or are able to access capital markets directly. This\ngreater access to capital markets is very likely substituting for what otherwise might have been\nbank loans.\nMany firms seeking bank loans use real estate as collateral. Figure 7 shows the growth\nof commercial real estate loans. Banks are rapidly expanding lending in the multifamily and\nconstruction and land-development sectors, despite the relatively high valuations for commercial\nreal estate in many markets.\nIn sum, while bank loan growth has not been as robust as in previous cycles, this likely\nreflects the nature of the crisis, recession, and recovery – and the continued substitution of credit\nfrom capital markets and non-bank lenders for bank loans – rather than particular weakness in\nunderlying economic conditions. In some bank loan categories – such as commercial real estate\n– it is actually surprising how rapidly loans are growing, given the prevalence of high valuations.\n\nRisks from Overseas\nAnother source of concern over the past several years has involved weak economic\nperformance in countries that are trading partners with the U.S. Indeed, geopolitical concerns\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nare likely to pose some potential risk to the U.S. forecast for the foreseeable future. However, on\nbalance, the risks from abroad seemed to have abated somewhat.\nFigure 8 shows the increases in stock prices in emerging markets, Europe, and the United\nStates since the beginning of this year. While U.S. stock prices have advanced, European stocks\nhave seen similar improvements – and emerging markets have increased more than the U.S. or\nEuropean indices. All this likely reflects increased investor optimism that the economic recovery\nin many countries is beginning to take hold, and the data for economic activity in the Euro Area\nand many other developed and emerging economies supports that assessment.\nFigure 9 shows the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast for real GDP growth this\nyear compared to last year – for the U.S., the Euro area, and emerging markets. In the United\nStates and in emerging markets, the IMF is expecting stronger growth over the next two years,\nwhich is consistent with the improvements in stock markets that we see. The IMF outlook for\nEurope is essentially unchanged, but given the recent turmoil generated by elections in several\nEuropean countries, continued positive growth is better than some had been expecting.\nWhile the risks of a slowdown from abroad will probably always be present in some\ndegree, this risk does seem to be abating of late. Economic forecasts for growth are increasing\nand investor sentiment has improved.\n\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nFigure 10 shows the federal funds rate targeted by the Federal Reserve. The Fed began\nthe normalization process in December 2015 by raising the federal funds target range to 25 to 50\nbasis points. Since that initial hike, the FOMC has increased the rates two additional times, in\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDecember 2016 and March 2017. The target range for the federal funds rate is currently between\n75 and 100 basis points.\nDespite the three 25-basis point increases in the federal funds rate target range, U.S.\nmonetary policy remains quite accommodative. Short-term nominal interest rates are below the\ninflation rate, so the real interest rate remains negative (the real rate is simply the nominal rate\nminus inflation). In addition, as mentioned earlier, most forecasters expect growth to exceed\npotential. With conditions now consistent with full employment and the Fed’s inflation target, in\nmy view, monetary policymakers should certainly continue on the path of gradual normalization,\nand continue to explore its pace.\nThe Federal Reserve has another monetary policy tool, as depicted in Figure 11. During\nthe financial crisis and its aftermath, when short-term interest rates approached zero the central\nbank needed to find other ways to return the economy to full employment and the 2 percent\ninflation target associated with price stability. Since short-term rates were essentially at zero, the\nFed lowered long-term interest rates by buying long-term Treasury securities and agency\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS). The result was an expanded central bank balance sheet that\nreached roughly $4.5 trillion in assets.\nLooking ahead, the federal funds rate would obviously exceed 1 percent after one more\n25 basis-point increase. In my view, that seems an appropriate point to consider beginning a\nvery gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. I believe the Fed should do\nso gradually, so that the reduction in the balance sheet is not disruptive, and so that it can occur\nlargely in the background. This would maintain the Federal Reserve’s focus on the federal funds\nrate as the primary instrument of monetary policy.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 12 provides the most recent forecast for the federal funds rate from Fed\npolicymakers, based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The dark\nline, the median forecast for the federal funds rate, increases gradually over the next two and a\nhalf years, peaking at 3 percent. The median forecast among policymakers is for two more\nincreases for this year. My own view remains that along with a gradual reduction in the level of\nthe balance sheet, it would still be reasonable to have three rate increases over the remainder of\nthis year, assuming the economy evolves like my forecast envisions.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would point out that the first quarter’s real GDP and\ninflation numbers proved to be somewhat weaker than many expected, but I do view these as a\ntransitory phenomenon. My expectation is that the economy will remain on solid footing, with\nthe unemployment rate likely to continue falling and already likely below its sustainable level,\nand inflation fluctuating around 2 percent.\nMy view is that such conditions justify continuing a gradual increase in the federal funds\nrate and also beginning to reduce gradually the level of the assets on the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet. As long as the balance sheet reduction is not steep, it should have only modest\neffects on credit markets – in other words it can be gradually reduced “in the background.” That\nwill allow Fed policymakers to focus primarily on gradual normalization of the federal funds\nrate, using it as the primary vehicle for attaining sustainable growth, full employment, and price\nstability at 2 percent inflation.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170503a.htm.\n\n2\n\nAn economy growing at potential is one that keeps the degree of resource utilization stable over time. In particular,\na stable unemployment rate is an indication that the economy is growing at potential. Periods of declining\nunemployment rate signal that GDP is growing above potential, and vice versa when the unemployment rate is\nincreasing. In the earlier stages of the recovery, it was important for the economy to grow faster than potential in\norder to raise the degree of resource utilization and bring the unemployment rate down. At the current stage of the\nrecovery, however, continued growth above potential runs the risk of overheating the economy. The potential\ngrowth rate of the economy needs to be inferred from the data, and it depends on the long-run growth rate of the\nlabor force and productivity. While in the short run labor force and productivity can be affected by cyclical factors,\nin the longer run labor supply is largely driven by demographic trends and productivity by technological progress.\nThere is uncertainty associated with the rate of growth of potential, despite the fact that some demographic\ndevelopments are relatively easy to predict. This uncertainty notwithstanding, the average pace of GDP growth\nduring the recovery has been enough to bring the unemployment rate down. As a result, over this period the\npotential growth rate of the U.S. economy has been less than 2 percent.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRisk Management for Commercial Real Estate\nFinancial Markets Conference,\nNew York University Stern School of Business\nNew York, New York\nMay 9, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. I would like to thank the Stern School of Business for inviting me to\nshare my perspectives today. Before I begin, let me note as I always do that the views I express\ntoday are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of\nGovernors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAs with almost any market where prices have risen quickly, commercial real estate\npresents a variety of positive fundamentals. While my remarks today focus on commercial real\nestate, other asset classes have experienced increases in valuation, including the equity markets\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand certain fixed-income markets. I would like to begin my talk today by highlighting some of\nthe positive fundamentals or strong “tailwinds.”\nFirst, macroeconomic conditions during this economic recovery have been favorable in\nsome respects. Inflation has remained quite stable, fluctuating around 2 percent. Monetary\npolicy has been quite accommodative, with the federal funds rate still quite low by historical\nstandards, and the central bank maintaining an enlarged balance sheet that has held down longerterm rates.\nA second favorable factor is the relative strength in the United States compared with the\nrest of the world. Many foreign economies’ recoveries have lagged behind the U.S., where we\nhave seen stable and solid, if unspectacular, economic growth. These relative international\nconditions have made real estate opportunities in the United States appear quite attractive to\nforeign investors.\nA third favorable contributor has been a variety of demographic factors that I will only\nbriefly discuss today. But suffice it to say, trends toward greater urbanization and a preference\namong the large cohort of millennials to seek multifamily accommodations have provided\nsupport for multifamily housing in particular.\nDespite these favorable conditions for commercial real estate, it is probably useful to\nconsider what could cause a reversal in commercial real estate prices. I will focus on just a few\npotential concerns.\nThe first involves potential changes to government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs. It is\nwell known that the GSEs play a very important role in the single-family housing market.\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, it is somewhat less well known outside of the real estate industry how active the GSEs\nare in multifamily housing. Given that GSEs and their securitized vehicles currently hold or\nguarantee 44 percent of multifamily loans, any GSE reform proposal that caused them to alter\ntheir participation in this market would likely leave a significant imprint on the industry.\nA second concern could be that an economic downturn might have a disproportionate\nimpact on commercial real estate. Very significant declines in commercial real estate values\nwere associated with both the 1990 and 2007 recessions. The occurrence of this type of event is\nactually part of the 2017 “stress tests” that the largest banks are now undergoing.\nA third potential concern could arise if inflation and interest rates moved much higher,\nand at a faster pace. While that is certainly not my expectation, and is not in the projections of\nFOMC participants, some private-sector forecasters have been placing odds on such an outcome\nso that it is worth considering.\nWhile I do not expect that a downturn in commercial real estate prices would by itself\ncause a significant problem for the economy, in some past recessions such an occurrence has\npropagated an initial adverse shock – and by constraining financial intermediaries, made the\nextent of the subsequent economic downturn more severe for a wide range of households and\nbusinesses that depend on intermediaries for credit. 1 Given the very low capitalization or “cap”\nrates 2 currently seen in the commercial real estate sector, it is important for holders of debt or\nequity related to commercial real estate (CRE) to carefully consider how their positions would be\nimpacted if tailwinds were to give way to headwinds. And perhaps most importantly, in my\nview the regulatory community must also remain attuned to developments, understand how a\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nreversal may propagate through the financial system, and consider whether the system is resilient\nenough to withstand such shocks, should they occur.\n\nDomestic Macroeconomic Factors Supporting U.S. Commercial Real Estate\nFigure 1 shows the strength of the rebound in commercial real estate prices following the\nfinancial crisis. While all four categories of commercial real estate have seen a substantial\nrebound in prices, the rebound in multifamily housing is particularly notable. The chart is\nindexed to the price peaks prior to the financial crisis, and it shows that multifamily commercial\nreal estate has surpassed the peak from prior to the financial crisis. In fact, by this measure\nmultifamily prices are now more than 25 percent higher than the pre-crisis peak.\nThere are a number of factors that have been particularly helpful for the commercial real\nestate recovery. Figure 2 shows the federal funds rate – the short-term interbank rate targeted by\ncentral bank monetary policy – for the period since 2000. As a result of the severity of the\nfinancial crisis, policymakers brought short-term rates down to zero. As the economy has\nrecovered from that very severe recession, the FOMC has raised the federal funds target to its\ncurrent range of 75 to 100 basis points. However, the rate remains quite low by historical\nstandards, as do other rates of both short and longer maturity. For interest-sensitive sectors, such\nas commercial real estate, this has no doubt contributed to the recovery.\nFigure 3 shows the assets on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Prior to 2008, the\nFed’s balance sheet was rarely discussed, since it increased only very gradually. During the\nfinancial crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve provided vital liquidity programs and\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npurchased long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to\ncreate appropriately accommodative conditions. With short-term interest rates effectively at\nzero, it was difficult to further influence long-term rates using traditional monetary tools, so the\nFederal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs were implemented to further lower longterm rates. Again, this policy action was inherently supportive of interest-sensitive sectors like\nreal estate.\nFigure 4 shows the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure of total inflation,\nas well as the core PCE measure of inflation. Unlike the 1970s, inflation over the past two\ndecades has been quite stable, fluctuating around 2 percent. 3 One reason for monetary policy to\nremain accommodative for so long has been that inflation has only gradually returned to the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target. And, of course, a low and stable inflation rate makes it much\neasier to make longer-term investments.\n\nInternational Factors Supporting U.S. Commercial Real Estate\nAs mentioned in my opening summary, international conditions have made the United\nStates an attractive place to invest in commercial real estate. Figure 5 shows the unemployment\nrate in the U.S. compared to the Euro Area. While the U.S. recovery has exhibited only modest\ngrowth compared to previous recoveries, the unemployment rate – at 4.4 percent – is now below\nmy own estimate (4.7 percent) of the so-called full employment level. In contrast, much of the\ndeveloped world has yet to significantly recover, with Euro Area unemployment – which was\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nabout even with the U.S. in late 2009 – now approximately double that of the United States 4 and\nstill well above pre-recession lows.\nThe rather weak recovery in many developed countries and the prevalence of very low\ninflation rates have caused central banks to continue to hold short-term interest rates near zero –\nand to expand their balance sheets. As Figure 6 shows, these policies by central banks have\ncontributed to low longer-term yields, with 10-year Treasury yields in the United States currently\naround 2.3 percent, while 10-year government rates in Japan, Germany, and France are much\nlower.\nThese very low short- and long-term interest rates have caused some international\ninstitutional investors to look abroad to generate higher returns. Given the relatively strong U.S.\neconomy, some of these investors have come to view U.S. commercial real estate investments as\nattractive ways to generate higher returns.\n\nDemographic Trends\nDemographic trends have also provided a favorable tailwind for some commercial real\nestate, particularly multifamily projects. The increased movement to urbanize in the United\nStates, due to the many amenities provided by cities for those families with rising incomes, has\nbeen supportive of commercial real estate. Certainly, my hometown of Boston has benefited\nfrom the trend of firms and households moving to increasingly attractive city environments.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 7 shows two other favorable trends for multifamily commercial real estate. On\nthe left is the median age of males and females when first married. Because a first home\npurchase is often related to marriage, a later marriage age results in more young adults living in\nmultifamily rather than single-family homes. The figure on the right shows the number of 25- to\n34-year-old head-of-households, over time. The demographic trends that have expanded this age\ngroup are a positive for multifamily real estate.\nThese charts suggest that it should not be surprising that trends have supported rising\ncommercial real estate prices. These macroeconomic and demographic trends are qualitatively\nconsistent with the strong commercial real estate markets we see in many parts of the country.\nHowever, it is harder to know if these conditions warrant the extent of price increase we have\nseen to date. We all know that for almost any asset category, positive trends can sometimes\nevolve into prices that increase more than fundamentals justify. It is very hard to distinguish\nhow much of the price gain is the result of the favorable fundamentals, and how much reflects an\nabundance of optimism by investors. So the next section of my talk explores the possibility that\nlow cap rates could experience a significant reversal.\n\nGSE Reform and Multifamily Real Estate\nOne potential risk to multifamily commercial real estate prices could come from GSE\nreform. While the timing and nature of such reforms are quite uncertain, the GSEs have been\nexpanding their role in the multifamily mortgage market. Figure 8 illustrates that the GSEs,\nincluding their securitized vehicles, hold or guarantee approximately 44 percent of multifamily\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nloans outstanding, and their role has increased notably over the past two decades. GSE holdings\nof multifamily loans outstanding now materially exceed those of the banking sector.\nThe multifamily segment is also a significant source of income for the GSEs. Figure 9\nprovides the percentage of income that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac derive from their activities\nin the multifamily commercial real estate mortgage market. Clearly, both GSEs earn a\nsignificant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business. 5\nA potential concern would be that with high and rising prices for multifamily commercial\nreal estate, policymakers looking to reform the GSEs might look at the GSEs’ large and growing\nfootprint in the market and ask whether this level of government-sponsored exposure is safe, and\nwhether that level of government support is appropriate. Whether, or how, future reform\nproposals will impact commercial real estate is unclear – but a potential and significant shock to\nthis sector of the commercial real estate market could occur if proposals require the GSEs to\nreduce their holdings of multifamily loans.\n\nExample from Bank Stress Tests\nThe largest banks in the United States undergo stress tests annually to see if they have\nsufficient capital to weather a severe economic shock. The 2017 stress test includes, among\nother things, a scenario of a significant decline in commercial real estate prices – as shown in\nFigure 10. The severely adverse stress-test scenario includes more than a doubling of the\ncurrent unemployment rate, and declines in aggregate commercial real estate prices of 35 percent\nthrough the first quarter of 2019. 6 Consistent with my comments earlier, the stress tests also\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsuggest that in their own calculations, banks take into account that these losses could be\nconcentrated in areas that have experienced rapid price gains – specifically noting multifamily\nproperties. 7\nWhile this is only a hypothetical scenario, it is designed to be consistent with economic\nrelationships that have occurred historically. Both the 1990 and the 2007 recessions exhibited\nvery significant declines in commercial real estate prices that aggravated significant negative\nshocks to the economy. The potential exists for commercial real estate price declines to\nsignificantly weaken the economy – particularly by weakening institutions that are critical to the\ncredit extension vital to the economy, and that have large and leveraged exposure to CRE. As a\nresult, many regulators have increased their focus on commercial real estate as valuations have\nrisen substantially.\nHow likely is a recession as severe as in the stress test scenario? And what are the\nconditions that might lead to a large shock to commercial real estate? It is indeed worth\nconsidering what type of economic conditions might lead to an eventual negative shock of the\nsort that is being modeled in the stress test. While the severely adverse stress-test scenario does\nnot have a probability attached to it, it is possible to look at private sector forecasts that provide\nprobability assessments of some “tail events” and related conditions, as well as their most likely\noutcome.\nFigure 11 provides the information from the Survey of Professional Forecasters –\nroughly 50 private sector forecasters – about their assessment of the probability of core PCE\ninflation rising above 2.5 percent. The forecasters assess a probability of over 10 percent for this\nyear and over 20 percent for 2018.\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 12 provides one reason for this elevated risk. The private forecasters see a\nroughly 10 percent probability of unemployment declining below 4 percent. Such an overheated\neconomy would likely be accompanied by higher inflation, which in turn would likely elicit\nhigher interest rates.\nWhile the downward trend in Figure 13 of long-term Treasury yields and multifamily\ncap rates has been quite favorable, an overheated economy could risk a significant reversal. This\nwould cause investors to demand much higher 10-year Treasury rates to compensate for the\npotential of higher inflation. Since multifamily rents would likely be slow to respond, significant\ndeclines in commercial real estate prices could result. 8\n\nConcluding Observations\nFigure 14 shows capitalization rates by commercial real estate sectors. A very low cap\nrate reflects a high valuation of real estate relative to net operating income. Valuations have\nrisen substantially by historical standards. Certainly a number of positive factors account for\nsome of the elevated valuations, but at such times it is worth asking what could go wrong.\nWhile an overheated economy followed by a recession is only one possible scenario, and\ncertainly not my prediction, it helps to illustrate one way in which low cap rates might be of\nconcern in the event of such a reversal. While all market participants should consider how their\npositions would be impacted by adverse scenarios, Figure 15 shows that leveraged institutions\nand government-sponsored entities have significant exposures to commercial real estate. In the\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nevent of an adverse scenario such as a recession, these exposures could pose significant risks to\nthese institutions.\nWhile I am certainly not expecting such a scenario to occur, central bankers are charged\nwith thinking about adverse risks to the economy. So current valuations in real estate are one\nsuch risk that I will continue to watch carefully.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee “Financial Stability: The Role of Real Estate,” remarks by Eric Rosengren at the Asia-Pacific High Level\nMeeting on Banking Supervision, March 22, 2017.\n2\n\nCapitalization or “cap” rates on real estate represent the ratio of net operating income produced by a property to the\nprice paid, calculated at the time of a transaction.\n\n3\n\nMeasured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.6 percent, and\nmeasured by total PCE, inflation is 1.8 percent.\n4\n\nThe unemployment rates for the U.S. and Euro Area are defined somewhat differently. One difference is based on\nage; the U.S. civilian unemployment rate tallies the unemployed share of the labor force age 16 years and older,\nwhereas the Euro Area’s harmonized unemployment rate calculates the unemployed share of the labor force age 15\nto 74. For both definitions, unemployed persons must be actively seeking work. Other differences between the\ndefinitions have to do with the definition of “actively” seeking work and whether individuals waiting to start a new\njob or awaiting recall after a layoff are counted as unemployed.\n5\n\nGSEs earn a significant share of income from the multifamily segment of their business, despite the fact that the\nmultifamily lending is a much smaller piece of their business than residential real estate.\n\n6\n\nSee page 6 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress\nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule.\n7\n\nSee page 5 of 2017 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Street Tests Required under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress\nTesting Rules and the Capital Plan Rule.\n8\n\nAs described, the cap rates for multifamily are currently very low, having been driven by both demand for the\nproduct and rental growth rates. It is important to note, however, that in addition to the general overheated economy\nscenario, slowing or declining rental rates for multifamily units will place upward pressure on cap rates. That is, if\ninvestors are no longer able to count rental growth in their return assumptions, they will turn to demanding a higher\ncap rate on current cash flows. Additionally, increases in interest rates that provide investors with other investment\nopportunities will serve to place upward pressure on the cap rates demanded for the multifamily product.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 9, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTherefore, a combination of both slowing rental growth and higher interest rates could move the cap rates higher\nmore rapidly than either single factor alone.\n\n12\n\n\f",

I would like to thank the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College for\ninviting me to share my perspectives today. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the\nviews I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\nIntroduction and Overview\nThe economy has continued to improve – and with the labor market achieving measures\nassociated with full employment, and inflation now fluctuating around1 the Federal Reserve’s 2\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npercent inflation target, some observers of the macroeconomy and monetary policy have turned\ntheir attention to a policy tool actively deployed in the United States during the financial crisis:\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\nAs short-term interest rates approached zero in 2008, it became difficult for monetary\npolicy to further stimulate the economy through short-term rates alone. Policymakers were\nlargely constrained from further reductions by the zero boundary. However, by purchasing longterm Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities – and thereby increasing the size\nof the Fed’s balance sheet – long-term rates could be reduced. Lower rates provided additional\nneeded stimulus, encouraging firms and individuals to incur more long-term funding and spur\neconomic activity that was desperately needed in the Great Recession and the long, slow\nrecovery that followed.\nWhile asset purchases were deployed during a period of extraordinary economic distress,\nnow that the gradual normalization of monetary policy is underway it is a good time to reevaluate the costs and benefits of a large balance sheet. I would note that the FOMC has\npublished a statement on its policy normalization principles and plans.2\nMany observers suggest that central banks’ use of their balance sheets should be limited\nsolely as a response to the type of severe economic conditions that occurred during the financial\ncrisis and in its aftermath. Others suggest – as I will today – that structural changes in the\nmacroeconomy may necessitate more frequent use of large scale asset purchases during\nrecessions.\nThis latter view hinges on the argument that the combination of low inflation, low rates\nof productivity growth, and slow population growth may imply an economy where normal or\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nequilibrium short-term interest rates remain relatively low by historical standards, even once the\neconomy has fully normalized. This notion of lower equilibrium rates has in fact been reflected\nby the policymakers participating in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections\n(SEP). The median forecast of Fed policymakers in March was that in the longer run, the federal\nfunds rate was likely to be only 3 percent, down more than a percentage point from assessments\nby Fed policymakers from a few years ago.\nLow equilibrium rates would have noteworthy implications in a downturn. Consider the\nfact that during most of the previous economic downturns, the Federal Reserve has reduced\ninterest rates by substantially more than 300 basis points. So a 3 percent federal funds rate\nwould imply a high probability that short-term interest rates would have to be lowered again to\nzero in response to future recessions. As a result, the central bank may need to again deploy its\nbalance sheet to augment traditional policy, spur economic activity, and achieve its mandates\nfrom Congress associated with employment and price stability.\nOne important implication, then, is that the exit from a large balance sheet may not prove\nto be a one-time event. So if done appropriately, the exit from the current large balance sheet\ncan serve as an important “playbook” for future recovery periods should it prove necessary.\nIn contrast to balance sheet use of this sort, central banks have significant historical\nexperience with moving short-term interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives. As a\nconsequence, it makes sense to continue to use short-term interest rates as the primary tool for\nmonetary policy. If central bank balance sheet activity is to be a secondary tool, then the exit\nfrom a large balance sheet should be conducted in ways that maintain the primacy of using shortterm interest rates to either slow down or stimulate the economy.\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTo preview my argument a bit, while the FOMC is still carefully considering its balance\nsheet exit strategy, in my own view an ideal policy would take a very gradual approach to\nbalance-sheet reduction. In my view that process could begin relatively soon and should not\nsignificantly alter the FOMC’s continuing gradual normalization of short-term interest rates.\nThat is, by initially retiring only a small percentage of maturing securities, and then very\ngradually shrinking the volume of the securities being reinvested, the tightening of short-term\ninterest rates should not need to be much different than it would be in the absence of shrinking\nthe balance sheet.\nToday, I will cover a bit of background and analysis on the use of the balance sheet as a\nmonetary policy tool. I will then discuss why I believe balance-sheet activity will likely continue\nto be deployed as a monetary policy tool in recessions, as long as short-term interest rates\nnormalize at relatively low levels. Low inflation and low growth in both the working-age\npopulation and in productivity seem likely for many developed economies in the future, so\nbalance sheet expansions – and exits – are likely to become more standard monetary policy tools\naround the world.\n\nBackground on Balance Sheet Activity\nBy way of background, Figure 1 shows the overnight policy rates for the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest\nrates rapidly in the U.S., as the economy slowed during the recession. Interest rates were pushed\neventually to zero as the financial problems associated with the Lehman failure led the central\nbank to deploy a large increase in reserves to counteract significant disruptions in short-term\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfinancial markets, bringing short-term rates to the effective lower bound. The European Central\nBank kept short-term rates somewhat higher for longer, but eventually also pushed their\nrefinancing rate to zero. And the Bank of Japan, which had set rates very low even prior to the\nGreat Recession, has maintained their call rate close to zero or slightly negative.\nThe United States has been the first country to begin the process of exiting from\nextraordinary monetary accommodation, raising short-term interest rates as a first step in the\nnormalization process. The Federal Reserve made an initial increase in short-term interest rates\nin December 2015, followed by additional 25 basis point increases in December 2016 and in\nMarch 2017. In contrast, both Europe and Japan have yet to reach the point of raising their\nhistorically low short-term interest rates.\nFigure 2 highlights the use of central bank balance sheet expansion in the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. As you can see, all three central banks significantly increased their balance\nsheets, as they all found lowering short-term interest rates insufficient to rekindle economic\ngrowth and slow disinflation. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet first began to increase as the\nfinancial crisis spread to a severe macroeconomic crisis. By indexing the changes in the three\nbalance sheets to their levels in 2000, the figure shows that the balance-sheet expansion in the\nU.S. was much more aggressive than the other central banks’ in the fall of 2008. However, when\nviewed relative to GDP, Figure 3 shows that Japan especially needed to do more, relative to the\nsize of its economy.\nImportantly, perhaps because it was more aggressive with monetary easing initially, the\nUnited States has recovered more quickly. The Fed’s balance sheet expansion stopped in 2014.\nIn contrast, both Japan and Europe have not yet stopped expanding their balance sheets.\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 4 shows 10-year government bond yields in the United States, France, Germany,\nand Japan since 2000. Long-term rates have fallen, for a variety of reasons. One factor was that\nthe balance sheets of central banks expanded – with purchases of longer-term Treasury securities\nand agency mortgage-backed securities in the U.S., and with purchases of a wider set of assets in\nEurope and Japan. In the U.S., rates on 10-year Treasury securities have generally remained\nabove 2 percent once the Federal Reserve stopped expanding its balance sheet, while 10-year\nrates continued to fall in Japan, Germany and France, as Europe and Japan continued to purchase\nassets.\n\nThe Balance Sheet as a Monetary Policy Tool\nAs I noted in my introduction, some observers consider balance-sheet use as an\nextraordinary tool, deployed as an emergency response to the severity of the financial crisis.\nHowever, other observers suggest that if low, short-term interest rates are likely a feature of the\neconomy even when monetary policy is normalized, it is possible that expanding the balance\nsheets of central banks will become a tool more commonly utilized during recessions.\nFigure 5 shows how the participants at FOMC meetings have viewed the likely longerrun value of the federal funds rate. On a quarterly basis, FOMC participants are asked to\nforecast a variety of economic variables, including the federal funds rate they expect in the\nlonger run. As the figure shows, policymakers’ median view of the longer-run federal funds rate\nas recently as 2012 was that it was expected to be over 4 percent. However, that view has\nevolved significantly, with the median view in March of this year being for a federal funds rate\nof only 3 percent in the longer run.\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe shaded band on the figure represents the central tendency, which provides the range\nof views of the participants omitting the top three and bottom three estimates. It is notable that\nin the March projections, while the median was 3 percent, many participants viewed the federal\nfunds rate as likely to be below 3 percent in the longer run. Assuming that the Federal Reserve is\nsuccessful in achieving 2 percent inflation in the longer run, a nominal rate of 3 percent implies a\nreal federal funds rate of only 1 percent.\nFigure 6 provides some perspective on a longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent.\nDuring recessions, it is not unusual for the federal funds rate target to be cut by more than 3\npercentage points; in fact, in many recessions, the federal funds rate target was reduced by more\nthan 5 percentage points. However, going into most recessions the federal funds rate was higher\nthan 5 percent, and as a result, despite the sharp declines the rate did not approach zero.\nFigure 7 provides similar information in tabular form. It emphasizes that other than\nduring the 1960 recession, all of the decreases in nominal federal funds rates have exceeded 3\npercentage points. On average, from the peak to the trough of interest rates, the declines average\nroughly 7 percentage points.\nFigure 8 shows the real federal funds rate, which is simply calculated by subtracting the\ncore PCE inflation rate from the nominal federal funds effective rate. While there are periods of\nnegative real federal funds rates – particularly after severe recessions – the most recent period\nhas featured negative real federal funds rates for an extended period of time. If the SEP median\nforecast is correct about the possibility of a real federal funds rate of only 1 percent in the longrun, it will be much more common for short-term real interest rates to become negative during\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrecessions, when the Federal Reserve normally reacts by lowering short-term nominal interest\nrates.\nFigure 9 provides similar information as Figure 7, but in tabular form. Parenthetically, it\nis worth noting that one reason the real rate could become so negative in the 1974 recession is\nbecause the inflation rate was so high. During much of the recent recovery, with the nominal\ninterest rate lodged close to zero, the real rate was determined by the value of the inflation rate.\nBut notably, a real short-term rate close to negative 2 percent was not sufficient to generate a\nrapid recovery.\nThe clear implication of very low short-term interest rates is that there will be a limited\nbuffer for monetary policy to respond to economic slowdowns. I believe that real short-term\nfederal funds rates are likely to be negative more frequently, and the nominal federal funds rate\nis likely to reach zero more frequently. And if policy rates do remain as low as currently\nexpected, it is likely to be more common for central banks to engage in asset purchases to\nstimulate the economy by reducing longer-term rates.\n\nReasons for Low Prevailing Rates\nSeveral economic factors have contributed to the widespread expectation of lower shortterm rates prevailing in the foreseeable future. The inflation rate, shown in Figure 10, has\nfollowed a very different pattern since the mid-1990s. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the\ninflation rate was above 3 percent. However, since the mid-1990s, inflation has generally\nfluctuated in a band much closer to 2 percent. And for much of the period since the Great\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecession, the inflation rate has been below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. While this\nlow and stable inflation rate has been beneficial in many respects, it has also provided less room\nfor interest rates to fall before hitting zero. Thus, there may be a trade-off with a low inflation\ntarget that policymakers may be willing to make, depending on their willingness to manipulate\nthe balance sheet.\nTwo other factors that lead to lower equilibrium rates involve an important link between\nthe economy’s potential growth rate, and real interest rates. Anything that lowers the potential\nrate of growth in the economy will both lower the incentive to invest (as real returns to investing\nwill fall on average with lower potential growth) and increase the incentive to save (as lower\nfuture returns on savings imply a greater need to save today). Lower investment demand and\nhigher savings both engender lower real rates of interest, so a fall in the potential growth rate will\ngenerally lead to a fall in equilibrium real interest rates.\nSeveral other recent features have contributed to a lower rate of potential growth in the\neconomy. One such feature is a reduction in productivity growth, highlighted in Figure 11.\nWhile quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in productivity are quite volatile, the smoothed productivity\ngrowth over the last several years has been noticeably lower than has been experienced over\nmuch of the previous 50 years. Lower productivity growth implies lower real interest rates, and\nagain this would suggest less of an interest-rate buffer during economic downturns.\nAnother factor impacting potential growth is the change in demographics in the United\nStates. The robust birth rates, immigration rates, and movement of women into the labor force\ncontributed to significant increases in the U.S. labor force – trends which have become much\nmore muted of late, as shown in Figure 12. Slower growth in the labor force lowers the\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npotential growth rate of the economy and, through the channels I just articulated, implies a lower\nreal interest rate.3 And, given the strong downward trend shown in the figure, slower labor force\ngrowth is expected to continue.\nThese factors are not unique to the United States. Many developed countries are\nexperiencing low inflation rates and demographic trends that have resulted in lower short-term\ninterest rates. This implies that tools other than movements in short-term interest rates, such as\nbalance-sheet tools, are likely to be a more common and necessary feature of monetary policy in\ncombating future recessions in many economies around the world.\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile the extensive use of central bank balance sheets has been a distinguishing feature\nof the most recent downturn and slow recovery, I see it as quite likely that this tool will be\nnecessary in future economic downturns. Unless productivity growth and demographic trends\nchange, or monetary policymakers set a higher inflation target, the feasible reductions in shortterm rates to combat recessions will not be sufficient. Thus, monetary policymakers are likely to\nneed to use balance-sheet tools.\nIf monetary policy is to rely primarily on short-term interest rates to normalize policy, as\nseems prudent given the historical experience, in my view the Federal Reserve should adopt\nbalance sheet exit strategies that reinforce the primacy of interest rate policy. Starting to shrink\nthe balance sheet earlier – and doing so in a very gradual fashion – implies very little reduction\nin the degree of monetary stimulus coming from the U.S. central bank’s balance sheet. This, in\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nturn, will allow policymakers to focus on gradual increases in the federal funds rate target as the\nprimary mechanism for normalizing monetary policy and calibrating the economy.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nMeasured by the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index or PCE, inflation is at 1.8 percent, but\nmeasured by total PCE inflation is just over 2 percent, specifically 2.1 percent.\n\n2\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n\n3\n\nWith a slower growth in the labor force, capital becomes relatively less scarce and therefore the return on capital\ndecreases. Also with an ageing population, there is an extra need of savings for retirement which creates an\nadditional pressure on accumulating savings and capital which in turn reduces the return on capital.\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Boston Economic Club\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 29, 2017\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“The Case for Gradual but Regular Monetary Policy\nNormalization”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Boston Economic Club\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 29, 2017\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Boston Economic Club for inviting me to share\nmy views on the economy today. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board\nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAs everyone is likely aware, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate target range by 25\nbasis points at its March meeting. The committee had previously increased the interest rate\ntarget range just twice in this tightening cycle – in December 2015 and in December 2016.\nWhile the FOMC has used the term “gradual” in its official policy actions,1 I think it is important\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nto be reminded that the term gradual is not synonymous with once a year just before Christmas.\nKidding aside, I view four increases this year as fully consistent with comments from FOMC\nparticipants stating that the path of normalizing rates will be gradual. Clearly, such a pace would\nbe slower than the previous tightening cycle, beginning in June of 2004, when the FOMC\nincreased interest rates at each meeting for 17 meetings.2\nBefore I walk you through the data and analysis, allow me to preview my bottom line.\nMy own view is that an increase at every other FOMC meeting3 over the course of this year\ncould and should be the committee’s default, unless economic data come in inconsistent with\nforecasts.\nAt present, the perception seems to be that the outcome of each FOMC meeting depends\non nuances of incoming data, with the base case being no change in rates. I would like to\nsuggest a somewhat different stance for policy over this year: an expectation to tighten at every\nother meeting unless incoming data are materially inconsistent with the forecast. Importantly,\nthis would still be a fully data-dependent approach, not a preset path, as it would hinge on the\nincoming data – but the base case would be four tightenings, reflecting the strength of the\neconomy that I believe justifies more regular normalization of interest rates.\nSuch a gradual, but more regular, tightening of rates is consistent with both the improved\n“starting” conditions and the continued good news about the economy. As I will describe today,\nit seems likely that the economy will have achieved both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate by the end of this year – full employment and stable prices (which the Federal Reserve\ndefines as 2 percent inflation). Even as the economy approaches the Fed’s dual mandate goals,\nwe still have a federal funds rate that is less than 1 percent, while inflation is approaching 2\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npercent, which implies a negative real interest rate (simply because the inflation rate exceeds the\nnominal interest rate). While it is not unusual to have negative real interest rates when the\neconomy is quite weak, as I will show today, it is unusual to still have negative real interest rates\nlate in a recovery when the economy is close to full employment and nearing the inflation target.\nWith this as overview, I will walk you through my analysis and describe why I believe a\ngradual but more regular move to normalization is now appropriate.\n\nThe Real Federal Funds Rate\nFigure 1 shows the nearly 50 years of the real federal funds effective rate – which is\nsimply the effective nominal federal funds rate minus the core PCE inflation rate. As the figure\nshows, it is by no means unprecedented to see a negative real rate. In such cases, the real federal\nfunds rate becomes negative because the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to help the\neconomy recover from a recession.\nHowever, the figure shows that the current period is unusual, both in just how negative\nshort-term real rates became and in how long real rates have remained negative. In truth, the\nchart understates how negative equilibrium short-term real interest rates would have become,\nbecause the federal funds rate fell to nearly its zero lower bound in late 2008. At that point,\nmovements in the real rate were determined exclusively by fluctuations in the inflation rate\nalone. This is one reason why the Federal Reserve needed to expand its balance sheet – with\nshort-term nominal rates at the zero boundary, additional monetary stimulus could be generated\nonly by lowering longer-term interest rates using asset purchases.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 2 shows the same chart, but adds an indication of the unemployment rate at the\ntime the real federal funds rates turned positive, and the current unemployment rate. What is\nclear in this figure is that prior to the last recession, the real federal funds rate was negative only\nwhile the unemployment rate was well above 5 percent. Thus, the current period is quite\nunusual, in that the unemployment rate is now 4.7 percent (which is my estimate of full\nemployment), but the nominal federal funds effective rate is roughly 0.88 percent while the total\nand core PCE measures of inflation are 1.9 and 1.7 percent, respectively, yielding essentially\nabout negative 1 percent as the real rate.\nThere are several reasons why the federal funds rate has remained so low.\nFirst, Figure 3 shows real GDP growth smoothed over the previous four quarters. The\naverage growth rate for each of the seven recoveries within the timeframe of the chart is also\nindicated. The figure emphasizes that during this recovery, real growth has remained very close\nto 2 percent. This is much slower than in the past, and the steady downward trend in the\nrecoveries’ growth rates is clear. Also, typically we see very strong growth in the initial stages\nof a recovery, before the real GDP growth rate slows down as the economy approaches full\nemployment. In part because of the severity of the financial crisis of 2008, the economy never\nexperienced strong growth during this recovery – but rather a slow, albeit steady, recovery.\nSecond, we normally see inflationary pressures build up in the latter stage of a recovery.\nFigure 4 shows total PCE inflation smoothed over the previous four quarters. Again, the current\nperiod has been unusual in how low the inflation rate has been throughout this recovery. Despite\nthe economy being at full employment, inflation remains just below the Federal Reserve’s 2\npercent target. Normally, we might have expected to see more inflationary pressures.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThus, with inflation approaching target, and a slow but steady recovery, the monetary\npolicy tightening cycle has been quite gradual. However, how gradual the normalization process\nshould be depends importantly on where one thinks the economy is going.\n\nForecasts of the Economy\nFigure 5 shows the PCE inflation outlook for the Survey of Professional Forecasters,\nwhich surveys roughly 50 private forecasters on their expectations for the economy. The median\nforecast for total PCE inflation is 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, before rising above\nthe Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWhat is perhaps even more striking is that the shaded region shows the 25 percent of the\nforecasts above and below the median. Focusing on the shaded region above the median in the\nsecond half of the forecast, one sees that many forecasters now expect the inflation rate will rise\nabove 2.2 percent toward the end of this year and the beginning of next year (recall that another\n25 percent of forecasts lie at or above, and at or below, the shaded area – which represents the\ninterquartile range or middle 50 percent). This highlights that a fair number of forecasters\nbelieve the focus of the Federal Reserve will shift from striving to move up to the 2 percent\ntarget, to worrying about overshooting it. Moreover, this pattern is consistent with Federal\nReserve statements that 2 percent is a target, not a ceiling, for the inflation rate.\nFigure 6 shows that the Survey of Professional Forecasters anticipates relatively healthy\ngrowth. While the previous four quarters have been relatively choppy, and the revised real GDP\ngrowth for the most recent quarter was just 1.9 percent, survey participants are expecting real\nGDP growth to exceed 2 percent for each quarter of this year. The fact that the unemployment\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrate has fallen while the economy has been growing by roughly 2 percent for most of this\nrecovery implies that the potential GDP growth rate is somewhat below 2 percent; my own\nestimate is about 1.75 percent. (Unemployment falls when growth is above the so-called\npotential rate). So the private forecasters in the Survey of Professional Forecasters are expecting\ngrowth that is on average nearly 60 basis points faster than the estimate of the potential growth\nrate.\nFigure 7 shows the unemployment rate forecast. Growth above the potential rate\ncontinues to exert downward pressure on unemployment. The median unemployment rate\nforecast falls to 4.5 percent by the end of 2017 in the Survey forecast. The shaded region again\nshows the 25 percent of the forecasts above and below the median. As the forecast stretches into\n2018, there are more survey participants expecting the unemployment rate to be below 4.4\npercent, with one-quarter at or below 4.3 percent.\nIt is important to place this all in the context of the unemployment rate that is likely to be\nsustainable in the long term. The Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nprovides estimates of what the participants at this month’s FOMC meeting thought the\nunemployment rate would be in 2017, 2018, 2019, and in the longer run – as shown in the table\nin Figure 8. The policymakers’ estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate are shaded.\nThe median estimate for the longer run is 4.7 percent. The range of estimates is 4.5 to 5.0\npercent, and if you drop the three highest and lowest estimates, the central tendency is 4.7 to 5.0\npercent. It is important to note that no FOMC participant currently expects an unemployment\nrate below 4.5 percent to be sustainable.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUnsustainably Low Unemployment Rates\nI now turn to a discussion of the potential costs of an unemployment rate below the\nsustainable rate. Figure 9 highlights the states that have unemployment rates below 4 percent –\na level well below the national rate that the FOMC participants expect will be sustainable in the\nlong run. There are currently 16 states with an unemployment rate below 4 percent, and four of\nthem are in New England – Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Three\nadditional states have rates at 4.0 percent.\nOf course there are some states with low natural rates of unemployment. For these states,\na rate near 4 percent would not be unusual. At the same time, comparing where states are now\nrelative to their 20-year averages, as shown in Figure 10, we see that 28 states are at least one\npercentage point below their 20-year average. In addition, 15 states are within 0.5 percentage\npoints of their 20-year minimum unemployment rate.4\nOne of the issues I often hear raised by businesspeople is the shortage of workers. A\ncommon complaint I hear is that they would expand their business, which is doing well, but they\ndo not feel they can find enough staff with the requisite skills to allow them to expand. I also\nhear about firms considering moving to cities such as Boston, because the colleges and\nuniversities in the area provide a ready workforce for firms seeking highly skilled workers.\nThe natural response of firms facing tight labor markets is to start raising wages. Figure\n11 shows the average hourly earnings for the country overall, and for two industry groups –\nconstruction, and professional and business services. These industries show that as labor\nmarkets have become tighter, earnings have been rising.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRising wages are likely a factor behind some private forecasters’ expectations of inflation\nexceeding 2 percent next year. However, there are concerns beyond wage and price inflation,\nsince an overheating economy can lead to other instabilities.\nFigure 12 shows the price to earnings (P/E) ratios for the S&P 500 since 1990. The high\nP/E ratio may reflect that after-tax earnings are likely to be much stronger in the future; however,\nit might also be an indication of growing investor confidence, which of course may or may not\nbe ratified over time.\nFigure 13 shows the spread between high-yield corporate bonds and the 10-year\nTreasury rate since 1995. Recent academic studies have found that very tight spreads for higherrisk bonds can be an indication of potential problems in the future.5 The current high-yield\nspread is now below the twenty-plus year average and trending lower, somewhat unusual for an\nenvironment when monetary policy has entered a tightening phase.\nFigure 14 shows the capitalization rate for multifamily housing. The capitalization rate –\nnet operating income relative to the price paid for the property – is unusually low. While there\nare secular changes in housing preferences, reflecting both demographic trends and a persistent\nhangover from the housing crisis, such low cap rates can call into question commercial real\nestate valuations should the economy experience a shock or slow-down.\nAll in all, a potentially overheating economy may be reflected in movements in the\noverall price level, in asset prices, or both. If the economy runs too hot, it could ultimately\nrequire a less gradual monetary policy adjustment – which could potentially place at risk the\nsignificant progress the economy and labor market have made since the Great Recession.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nRecent economic reports have been consistent with continued steady improvement in the\neconomy. The most recent U.S. employment report featured payroll employment growing by\n235,000, the unemployment rate declining by 0.1 percentage points to 4.7 percent, and an\nincrease in average hourly earnings of 2.8 percent. With the economy at my estimate of full\nemployment, and with wages and prices rising, in my view it was entirely appropriate to raise the\nfederal funds rate target range by 25 basis points in March.\nLooking ahead over the course of this year, I believe it is likely to be appropriate for the\nFOMC to raise rates at a more regular – though still gradual – pace. With the nominal rate still\nlow and inflation approaching 2 percent, the result is a real rate below zero. With the real\neffective federal funds rate still quite negative, I consider it appropriate to move the nominal rate\n– gradually but more regularly – so the real rate becomes less negative.\nAs some of my colleagues on the FOMC have emphasized, conditions do not require the\nFOMC to rush policy actions. With real GDP growth expected to be only modestly above 2\npercent and total inflation in the short run expected to just reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ntarget, I certainly believe the FOMC can be gradual in removing accommodation. Nonetheless,\nit is important to avoid creating an over-hot economy that could require a more rapid tightening\nof monetary policy – which would place at risk the economic improvements seen to date.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170315a.htm.\n\n2\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M. on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n3\n\nFOMC meetings with a press conference give an opportunity to better explain the data and the rationale of the\ndecision; however, the Committee may decide on an interest rate change at any FOMC meeting if the data determine\nso.\n4\n\nThe most recent 240 months were used to calculate the 20-year average – from March 1997 through February\n2017. If instead the 20-year average is calculated using the period 1987 through 2006 in order to omit the Great\nRecession and the surrounding period with its high unemployment rates, 22 states are at least one percentage point\nbelow their 20-year average. In addition, 15 states are within 0.5 percentage points of their 20-year minimum\nunemployment rate and 1 state is below. While most of New England and the West Coast appear using both\ncalculations, switching to the earlier period for the average shades less of the Midwest and more of the commoditydependent Southwest.\n5\n\nSee Lopez-Salido, David, Jeremy C.

I would also like to thank our host, Bank Indonesia.\nIt is a pleasure to be here to share what are my own perspectives on assessing financial\nstability risk.

Given that the topic of financial stability is rather less established than\nmonetary policy, it is particularly important to have ongoing opportunities to share analysis and\nperspectives on what works, and what does not, around the world.\nIn that spirit, I would like to share my own views on the sources of financial instability\nthat have, historically, led to widespread economic disruption not only in large economies like\nthe United States, but in many parts of the world as well. I would like to specifically address the\nproblems that arise when the value of commercial or residential real estate fluctuates\nsignificantly – a dynamic that often leads to episodes of financial instability.\nMy comments should be placed in some very important context, however. First, I am not\nhere today to predict problems, but rather to suggest we continue working to head them off.\nSecondly, it is important to note that we see much safer financial systems in many countries\ntoday, as a result of regulatory enhancements that were enacted since the financial crisis of 2008.\nMany of the largest banks in the world are much better capitalized and have much more liquidity\nthan they did during the period leading up to the financial crisis. This has undoubtedly made the\nglobal financial system more stable; being both less likely to be the source of a major disruption,\nand better prepared to withstand an external shock, should one occur.\nDespite having a more resilient financial system, I would suggest that other\nmacroeconomic factors may – unfortunately but perhaps inevitably – have some unintended side\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neffects that are less supportive of financial stability. For example, very low interest rates in\nmany parts of the world – which were wholly necessary to propel the global economy out of the\nGreat Recession, and I strongly supported – may inevitably encourage a “reach for yield” in a\nworld with an increasingly global flow of investment funds. Demographically, we are seeing\naging populations whose need for reasonable yields on retirement assets may further incent a\nreach, often in riskier assets. So while increased regulatory scrutiny has established important\n“fire breaks” against financial flare-ups, other trends could actually mean more frequent and\npossibly more intense “fires.” My point is just that we should not feel overconfident, thinking\nthat strengthening the resilience of global banks is, by itself, sufficient. Further thoughtful\nactions may be called for.\nCertainly, one risk to be mindful of has been the acceleration of real estate values in some\nparts of the world, and I will use the United States as an example in my remarks today.\n\nReal Estate and Financial Stability\nIn the years since the financial crisis of 2008, there has been a coordinated effort to make\nthe financial sector more stable, given the widespread difficulties of many of the very large\nfinancial institutions in developed countries during the crisis. Many regulators now require more\ncapital, greater liquidity, and detailed resolution plans. The absence of these defenses\ncontributed to the severity of the financial crisis, and the disruption of the availability of credit\nfrom financial intermediaries contributed to the dramatic contraction in the broader economy,\namplifying problems.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMake no mistake, the steps taken to increase the stability of financial intermediaries and\nthe financial system are vital. While such steps will likely mitigate the severity of future\nproblems and recessions, I would however suggest that they may not be sufficient.\nAs helpful as steps taken to date have been, policymakers and market participants need to\nstay focused on several issues, including what I would consider the root cause of the financial\ncrisis. I would argue that the root cause of the financial crisis was a significant decline in\ncollateral values of residential and commercial real estate. This was not particularly unusual; in\nfact, financial crises of the past 70 years have generally been caused by exposures across the\nbanking system that are correlated and sizeable – primarily either exposure to foreigndenominated debt that is subject to exchange rate risk, or exposure to real estate that becomes\nvulnerable when its value declines precipitously.\nIn the former scenario, the Mexican peso crisis (in 1994) and Asian financial crisis (in\n1997) are two examples where large exposure to debt denominated in foreign currency became\nproblematic when the home country’s currency devalued, making repayment in foreign currency\nprohibitively expensive.\nThe other main triggering mechanism has been a rapid and sizeable decline in real estate\nvalues.1 Because many financial intermediaries lend to households and businesses with real\nestate as the collateral, recessions that are accompanied by significant declines in real estate\nvaluations can lead to broader problems. Because recessions or rapid changes in asset values\nentail a loss or reduction of income for many households and businesses, and a loss of equity that\ncan leave loans underwater, the likelihood of borrower default increases, adding to problems.\nExamples include the decline in real estate values that occurred during periods of banking\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproblems in Japan (in 1990) and Sweden (in 1991), as well as the credit crunch and financial\ncrisis periods in the United States (for example, the credit crunch of the early 1990s and the\nfinancial crisis of 2008).\nToday, I will focus on financial problems triggered by changes in real estate values. I\nwould note that over the past roughly 70 years, there have been 11 recessions in the United\nStates. Of those recessions, two featured a significant financial stability component, where\nbanking problems significantly aggravated the severity of the recession.\nIn the early 1990s recession in the U.S., commercial real estate values – particularly on\nthe two coasts – declined significantly. The large losses in commercial real estate values\ntriggered a wave of bank failures and an ensuing credit crunch. While a large number of banks\nfailed, as shown in Figure 1, most of the banks involved were relatively small. In the recession\nthat began in December of 2007, the loss in residential real estate values also caused a notable,\nbut not as large, jump in the number of bank failures – but this time the affected banks were\namong the largest. Figure 2 shows that the value of failed-bank assets in real terms was much\nmore severe as a result of the large-bank failures.\nIn terms of the real economy, both recessions were quite severe. The unemployment rate\npeaked at 7.8 percent in June 1992; and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the\nunemployment rate peaked at 10 percent (in October 2009).\nFigure 3 shows that commercial and residential real estate prices behaved differently\nduring these two periods. First, commercial real estate prices have been more volatile than\nresidential real estate prices, and actually declined during both the earlier credit crunch period\nand during the more recent financial crisis. Second, commercial real estate prices did diverge\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfrom residential prices in the late 1980s commercial real estate downturn; in fact, there is\nrelatively little movement in the national residential real estate price index during that period.2\nThird, while the financial crisis is normally considered to have been primarily motivated by\nresidential real estate problems, commercial real estate prices during the financial crisis also\ndeclined quite dramatically.\nThe impact of these price movements is best seen in Figure 4, which shows the\ndelinquency rates of commercial and residential real estate. While the credit crunch period had\nmore than 8 percent of commercial real estate loans as delinquent, there was only a modest\nincrease in the delinquency of residential loans. In contrast, both commercial and residential real\nestate loan delinquencies rose sharply during the more recent financial crisis.\n\nLeveraged Banks and Real Estate\nReal estate has a significant financial stability implication because real estate tends to be\nleveraged by the owners, and those loans represent a significant exposure for financial\ninstitutions that are themselves highly leveraged. When large losses have occurred because of\ndeclines in real estate values,3 banks have historically shrunk their lending to meet binding\ncapital-to-assets ratios (given that loans are assets for financial institutions).\nSuch a tightening of lending has several compounding effects. In addition to negatively\nimpacting economic activity, tighter lending conditions also make it more difficult to sell\nimpaired assets, given that potential buyers would need bank loans at a time when banks would\nbe much less willing to lend.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, banking institutions continue to hold a significant share of loans\nrelated to real estate. I would note the share of commercial real estate mortgages held by banks\nwith under $50 billion in assets. However, even the largest banks have a significant exposure to\nthe real estate sector.4 Importantly, even though the commercial real estate cycle has been\ntrending up for some time, the more-recent growth in lending has been quite significant. Over\nthe past year, holdings of commercial mortgages by the banking sector have increased 8.9\npercent, while bank holdings of multifamily mortgages have increased 12.0 percent. This growth\nhas occurred while bank supervisors have been cautioning about the potential risks emanating\nfrom the high valuations in some sectors of the real estate market.\n\nRegulatory Response to Real Estate Lending Exposures\nIn 2006, commercial real estate guidance was issued by U.S. bank regulators that\nencouraged institutions to improve their risk management if their exposure to commercial real\nestate became large relative to their risk-based capital.5 As of the end of 2015, as commercial\nreal estate activity and lending became more buoyant in the United States, bank regulators issued\na statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending. The statement\nreemphasized policy issued in 2006 and other existing guidance, and further required enhanced\nrisk management and commensurate capital levels for banks with large commercial real estate\nexposures. The statement noted that “the agencies have observed that many CRE asset and\nlending markets are experiencing substantial growth, and that increased competitive pressures\nare contributing significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values.”6\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEven with the issuance of real estate guidance, loans held by banks have increased.\nWhile the risk management of banks with large commercial real estate exposures has likely\nimproved, the impact of the guidance on the trajectory of commercial real estate prices appears\nmodest, as Figure 6 shows. In particular, apartment building prices have increased sharply and\nare now significantly above the peak prior to the financial crisis. While there have been changes\nin home ownership rates and household formation that may reflect a secular shift to apartments,\nand large apartment buildings in major United States cities have become quite trendy (including\nin my area, Boston), the increase in prices may suggest a need for further consideration of the\npotential financial stability implications if this trend were to continue.\nOther sectors of commercial real estate have also experienced significant price increases.\nThe only sector to show some moderation is retail, a sector that has been impacted by the very\nsizable movement from brick-and-mortar retail sales to online retail purchases – a secular trend\nthat may still be playing out.\nIncreases in prices would not be as problematic if rental income were rising\ncommensurately. However, Figure 7 provides the capitalization or “cap” rates – defined as net\noperating income7 divided by the price of the property – for different property types. All the\ncapitalization rates have fallen substantially, which means that price increases have been\noutpacing growth in net operating income. Apartment capitalization rates are particularly low,\nand are at their lowest point over the past 16 years.\nAs the economy improves, higher market interest rates would normally slow new\nconstruction as well as valuations in interest-sensitive sectors. However, the slow recovery and\nthe possibility that equilibrium interest rates may remain relatively low, reflecting demographic\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand productivity trends, may make it more difficult to slow down the real estate sector with\nhigher interest rates. This would require a greater emphasis on macroprudential tools if\nvaluations became a source of concern. However, with limited macroprudential tools available\nand only a modest price response to date to guidance, it is prudent to keep a healthy, ongoing\nfocus on the sufficiency of these tools and their ongoing enhancement.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would observe that real estate has played an important role\nin past periods of financial instability. Its use as collateral by leveraged institutions has factored\ninto significant problems in countries that have experienced a significant revaluation of real\nestate asset values. As I have noted today, in the United States the two most significant recent\nperiods of financial instability were accompanied by declines in real estate values that impacted\nfinancial institutions and intensified the business cycle.\nCurrently, commercial real estate capitalization rates are very low by historical standards,\nmeaning that price increases have been outpacing growth in net operating income. This is\noccurring despite the gradual tightening of short-term interest rates and the issuance of real estate\nguidance by bank regulators.\nBecause real estate holdings are widespread, and the monetary and macroprudential tools\nfor handling valuation concerns are somewhat limited, I believe we must acknowledge that the\ncommercial real estate sector has the potential to amplify whatever problems may emerge when\nwe at some point face an economic downturn. I am not expecting such problems in the near\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:45 P.M. on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 U.S. Eastern Time which is 9:45 A.M. on Wednesday,\nMarch 22, 2017 in Bali, Indonesia OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nterm, but would say that awareness, informed by data and analysis, is a first important step to\ncontinued actions that can head off unwelcome problems in the future.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThis mechanism has been examined in the monetary policy literature, see for instance Iacoviello (2005) and\nJustiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2015) among others. Specifically, see: Iacoviello, M. (2005). House prices,\nborrowing constraints, and monetary policy in the business cycle. American Economic Review vol. 95(3); and\nJustiniano, A., G. E. Primiceri, and A. Tambalotti (2015). Household leveraging and deleveraging. Review of\nEconomic Dynamics 18(1), 3-20.\n2\n\nA national average can mask regional differences. Although the national index shows relatively little movement in\nresidential real estate prices on average during that period, it is worth noting New England housing prices did\nexperience a decline. See https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/337_378.pdf.\n3\n\nBanks and banking systems have generally fared poorly when values of large exposures boom and bust. Another\nfacet of the problem for banks is when residential borrowers or distressed commercial borrowers become “under\nwater.”\n4\n\nAlso notable is that smaller banks hold a larger share of commercial and multifamily residential mortgages than\nlarge banks, whereas large banks hold a larger share of home mortgages than smaller banks.\n5\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2007/SR0701.htm.\n\n6\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20151218a.htm, which includes the following:\n“Recent Supervisory Findings: The agencies have observed that many CRE asset and lending markets are\nexperiencing substantial growth, and that increased competitive pressures are contributing significantly to\nhistorically low capitalization rates and rising property values.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 15, 2017\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\n“Monetary Policy as the Economy Approaches\nthe Fed’s Dual Mandate”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 15, 2017\n\nGood afternoon. I would like to thank the New York Association for Business\nEconomics for having me here today to share my views on the economy. At the outset, let me\nnote as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nThe economy continues to grow moderately – at about the same 2 percent pace that it has\nfor the past several years. This rate of expansion is slower than the historical average, but that\nappears to be largely due to declines in the rate of growth of productivity and the labor force.1\n\n2\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nOver the next year or two, I expect real GDP to grow somewhat faster than 2 percent, the\nunemployment rate to continue to gradually decline, and inflation to gradually return to the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nRecent data have been quite consistent with this outlook. Real GDP for the fourth quarter\nof 2016 grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate, with continued strength in consumer spending offset\nby an export slowdown. Weak exports were, in turn, the result of lethargic growth among many\nof our trading partners, as well as a relatively strong dollar. The labor market report for January\nshowed that the economy added 227,000 new jobs, and an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent – a\nreading that is close to most economists’ estimate of full employment. What’s more, total and\ncore PCE inflation measures are approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target, at\n1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.2\nWhile my forecast envisions a continuation of the economic growth we have seen over\nthe past several years, it is important to note that the “starting point” is now quite different than it\nwas a few years ago. The current 4.8 percent rate of unemployment is the same as the median\nforecast for unemployment in the long run by Federal Reserve policymakers (in the Federal\nReserve’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP)3 and only 0.1 percent above my own\nestimate of full employment. This would suggest that there is limited room for further tightening\nin labor markets before one might see more inflationary pressures. Also, inflation is now close\nenough to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target that it is possible that we will reach the target as\nsoon as the end of this year. However, inflation is not the only consequence of reaching or\nexceeding full employment: Another possibility is that imbalances will manifest themselves in\nasset prices, such as the price of commercial real estate.\n\n3\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAs I will discuss today, with the economy at or approaching both elements of the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate (price stability and maximum sustainable employment), it is my view\nthat it will likely be appropriate to raise short-term interest rates at least as quickly as suggested\nby the Fed’s current SEP median forecast, and possibly even a bit more rapidly than that\nforecast. Importantly, if GDP is growing faster than potential and we reach both elements of the\ndual mandate, the Federal Reserve risks “overshooting,” potentially jeopardizing the very\nsignificant progress of the U.S. economy since the financial crisis.\n\nRecent Trends in the Labor Market\nI would like to walk you through the data that underpin my perspective. Figure 1 shows\ninitial claims for unemployment insurance. In 2005 and 2006, the years immediately preceding\nthe financial crisis, initial claims for unemployment insurance were averaging a bit over 300,000.\nThey rose sharply, more than doubling, during the worst of the financial crisis and recession, but\nhave declined quite consistently over the past several years. The most recent weeks’ data have\nseen initial claims hovering around 250,000 – below the level seen before the last recession.\nAs job prospects increase, workers become more confident that they will have the ability\nto improve their employment situation. As overall job prospects in the marketplace improve and\nworkers’ confidence rises, employers may well need to pay current employees higher wages to\nreduce the incentive for workers to quit in search of wages reflecting the rising market. As such,\na rising “quits rate” is one gauge of how workers feel about the labor market’s robustness and\nmay also be a sign of emerging wage pressures.\n\n4\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 2 shows the quits rate. Not surprisingly, the quits rate plunged during the financial\ncrisis, as employees were primarily concerned with keeping their jobs in a significantly\ndeteriorating labor market. As labor markets have improved, the quits rate has risen. The quits\nrate is still somewhat below the level prior to the recession – likely due to the aging of the\nworkforce, and the lingering memory of recent concerns about employment security. But it\nshows a significant improvement in how employees are viewing the labor market.\nRecent payroll employment, shown in Figure 3, has also been consistent with continued\nstrength in the labor market. In January, the economy added 227,000 jobs. Over the past three\nmonths, the average has been 183,000 jobs – only slightly below the average for the last year.\nThis growth rate will likely produce further declines in the unemployment rate, since\nemployment is growing faster than the growth in the labor force that we expect over time.\nThe widely reported U-3 measure of civilian unemployment, shown in Figure 4, now\nstands at 4.8 percent, which coincides with the median long-run unemployment rate expected by\nFOMC participants in the Fed’s SEP. The chart also shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast\n(the green dots) for the next two years, as well as the SEP median forecast (the dark blue dot) of\nthe path of the unemployment rate. The SEP median and the Blue Chip consensus forecasts\nexpect the unemployment rate to end the year at 4.5 percent.\nWhile the SEP assumes the unemployment rate will level off at that rate in 2018, the Blue\nChip forecasters expect it to continue to fall somewhat below 4.5 percent. My own forecast is\nmore consistent with the path of the Blue Chip consensus forecast, in that I expect real GDP to\ngrow faster than potential, continuing to place downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\n5\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nOne feature of the recovery from the Great Recession has been the decline in the labor\nforce participation rate, shown in Figure 5. The labor force participation rate is defined as the\npercentage of the working-age population (16 and older) that is either working or actively\nseeking work. Over most of the recovery, the labor force participation rate has declined. At\nfirst, the cyclical response of the participation rate had been reinforcing the trend associated with\nmore people in the U.S. reaching retirement age. But as the recovery progressed, the trend\ndecline due to an aging population has been offset by a positive cyclical response of increasing\nparticipation. Thus, the recent levelling off of participation, as seen in the chart, should be read\nas a sign of labor market strength.\nAnother feature of the labor market has been the median duration of unemployment,\nshown in Figure 6. The median duration of unemployment peaked after the Great Recession and\nhas been steadily declining during the recovery. It is now only somewhat higher than it was\nprior to the last recession, although there remain an elevated number of people who have\nexperienced a long duration of unemployment.4\nIn summary, the labor market has significantly improved during the recovery, and my\nown assessment is that there is very limited slack remaining. The unemployment rate is now at\nthe SEP median forecast for unemployment in the longer run, and employees are becoming more\ncomfortable switching jobs, and the duration of unemployment has normalized. Were the\neconomy to grow much faster than potential, employers would likely encounter increasing\ndifficulty in finding labor with the skills they need to grow. This potential labor shortage will\nplace a premium on workforce development – which is consistent with comments I am\n\n6\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nincreasingly hearing from business and government contacts about the need for enhanced\ntraining for potential employees.\n\nEconomic Growth\nTurning to growth, Figure 7 shows the past two quarters of real GDP growth and the\nforecast of real GDP growth over the next four quarters from the Blue Chip consensus forecast.\nWhile the 2016 fourth-quarter real GDP growth was only 1.9 percent, it followed a very\nstrong 3.5 percent growth rate in the third quarter. As you can see, the Blue Chip forecast\nexpects real GDP growth above 2 percent. Given my 1.75 percent estimate of the rate of\npotential growth, the Blue Chip growth forecast would yield a falling unemployment rate.\nOne source of the strength in the outlook is robust consumer spending, which accounts\nfor roughly two-thirds of real GDP. Consumption was strong in the second half of 2016, as\nshown in Figure 8, and is likely to continue to be relatively robust, reflecting strong payroll\nemployment, continued real income growth, and significant wealth gains over the past several\nyears.\nThis growth in consumption is likely to offset areas of the economy that remain relatively\nweak. One important source of weakness has been exports, as shown in Figure 9. As monetary\npolicy in the United States has become less accommodative, especially relative to our key\ntrading partners, the exchange value of the dollar has risen. This appreciation, coupled with the\ngeneral weakness of the economies of many U.S. trading partners, has caused real exports to\nslow.\n\n7\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 10 shows the SEP median and Blue Chip consensus forecasts for real GDP\ngrowth over the next two years. The Blue Chip forecast is more optimistic than the SEP, with\nthe median forecast of Federal Open Market Committee participants expecting only 2.1 and 2.0\npercent real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018, respectively. My own forecast is more consistent\nwith the Blue Chip consensus forecast, which is one reason why I am concerned about a\npotential overshoot of a sustainable full-employment outcome for the economy.\nFigure 11 provides the SEP median forecast for the federal funds rate from the December\nFOMC meeting. The path of interest rates in the SEP median forecast may well be reasonable if\nthe U.S. economy averages about 2 percent growth over the next two years. However, if real\nGDP grows faster than that – as I expect it may – it is reasonable to expect additional labor\nmarket tightening, gradual increases in inflation and, potentially, emerging imbalances in some\nasset markets. Should this forecast for somewhat faster growth than projected in the SEP\nmaterialize, my own view is that the U.S. economy may need somewhat less monetary policy\naccommodation.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe economy has continued to improve. Most forecasters are predicting above-potential\ngrowth and a gradual tightening in labor markets. In my view, such a path would justify a\ncontinued, gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation at least as quickly as suggested\nby the current SEP, and possibly even a bit more rapidly than that forecast.\n\n8\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1:10 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nHowever, as with any forecast, there remains great uncertainty. Significant risks to the\nU.S. economy still exist, particularly from conditions in overseas economies. Also, the future\nstance of fiscal policy in the United States is still unknown. These areas of uncertainty can\nmaterially impact the forecast, and by extension, the path of policymaking that would be\nconsistent with those forecasts.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThese have lowered my estimate of the so-called potential rate of GDP growth. The quite modest growth rate we\nhave seen over the course of the recovery has been accompanied by a significant decline in unemployment. This\nconfirms that even historically modest 2 percent growth has exceeded the potential growth rate, throughout the\nrecovery.\n2\n\nThe target is defined in terms of total PCE inflation.\n\n3\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20161214.pdf.\n\n4\n\nIn January, more than 24 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. While that is\ndown from a peak of 45 percent following the recession, it is still elevated relative to a pre-recession average of 18\npercent.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConnecticut Business & Industry Association\nand the MetroHartford Alliance\nEconomic Summit & Outlook 2017\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 9, 2017\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the Connecticut Business & Industry Association\nand the MetroHartford Alliance for having me here today to share my views on the economy. At\nthe outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn the two years since I last addressed this gathering, much has changed. For those who\nhave heard me speak here over the years, you may recall that from 2007 to 2014, I was a strong\nadvocate for exceptionally accommodative monetary policy to combat the severe recession we\nexperienced in the wake of the financial crisis. More recently, my comments have moved in the\nother direction, advocating for a gradual return to a more normal monetary policy. It is not that\nmy underlying views or economic analysis have changed; rather, economic circumstances have\nevolved and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy.\nToday I will discuss how my earlier preference for “easy” monetary policy and my\ncurrent desire to gradually normalize the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance reflect a\nsingle, consistent framework. I would note that my views on the stance of policy, while evolving\nwith the shifting economic conditions, have remained fully consistent with the Fed’s dual\nmandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.\nAs everyone likely knows, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the FOMC, raised\nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points twice since the recovery began – first in December 2015,\nand then in December 2016. I was strongly supportive of both moves and see them as reflecting\nthe strength of the U.S. economic recovery.\nFor reasons that I hope to make clear in my remarks today, I expect that appropriate\nmonetary policy will need to normalize more quickly than over the past year, but certainly not as\nrapidly as in the last tightening cycle, which began in 2004. The current unemployment rate is at\nmy estimate of what is likely to be sustainable in the long run, and total and core PCE inflation\nmeasures are approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target (which is defined in\nterms of total PCE inflation). Without further gradual increases in interest rates, one might be\n\n2\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nconcerned that the unemployment rate could drift below its long-run sustainable level – and as a\nresult, inflation could eventually exceed the Fed’s 2 percent target. So the stance of monetary\npolicy will need to adjust – to prevent the economy from dramatically overshooting on both\nelements of the dual mandate, which would place the economic recovery at risk.\n\nRecent Financial Market Movements\nFigure 1 shows the federal funds rate over the past 15 years. It places the recent increase\nof 25 basis points in context, and contrasts recent policy actions with those of the last tightening\ncycle. In the previous tightening cycle that began in 2004, the FOMC raised the federal funds\nrate by 25 basis points at each meeting. This was described in FOMC statements at the time as\nincreasing rates at a “measured pace.” Clearly the last two increases, in December 2015 and\nDecember 2016, represent quite a patient policy stance relative to the “measured pace” in the\nprevious cycle.\nSuch a slow normalization path has been appropriate for several reasons. The significant\nloss of jobs during the Great Recession ensured the recovery to full employment would not be\nquick. Real GDP has been growing only slightly faster than potential over most of the recovery,\nalthough the growth of potential GDP is certainly slower than it used to be. And through the\nrecovery period, inflation rates both here and abroad have remained well below the inflation\ntargets set by central banks. Because policymakers consistently missed on the weak side of both\nelements of the dual mandate, it is my view that the very patient and gradual approach to raising\nthe funds rate has been entirely appropriate.\n\n3\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConsistent with the FOMC having raised interest rates quite gradually, expectations for\nadditional increases assumed by markets remain quite modest. Figure 2 shows the federal funds\nrate projections through 2017 implied by the futures market at three points – at the time of the\nfirst tightening in December 2015, at the beginning of last July after the Brexit vote, and as of\nlast Friday. The financial markets have indicated skepticism about how quickly the Federal\nReserve will be able to normalize rates, and imply a path only somewhat faster than the past two\nyears.\nDespite the relatively slow pace of increases reflected in market expectations for the\nfederal funds rate, longer-term rates have increased significantly since the November FOMC\nmeeting. The bar chart in Figure 3 shows that the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate has increased by\nmore than 50 basis points, and long rates in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan have also\nincreased – although by much less. These results may reflect the expectation of potentially more\nstimulative fiscal policy, greater confidence that inflation will increase toward targets, and more\noptimism about global prospects.\nAn indicator of greater confidence in inflation rates rising to targets is seen in the “breakeven” inflation rates that are implied by the difference between five-year Treasury rates and rates\non five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). As shown in Figure 4, over the past\nfive years the break-even inflation rate has been well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ninflation target, but since early November the implied inflation rate has risen quite close to that\ninflation target. This indicates a growing confidence by financial market participants that the\neconomy will successfully reach the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target, and should average quite\nclose to 2 percent inflation over the next five years.\n\n4\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThe recent movement in financial market prices should provide greater confidence that\nthe Federal Reserve is finally closing in on both elements of its dual mandate, and that an\nincreased pace of the gradual monetary policy normalization in the United States is appropriate.\nThis is particularly noteworthy considering that central banks in other developed countries are\nstill easing monetary policy in attempts to reach their inflation targets.\n\nThe Labor Market Outlook\nFigure 5 shows the path of two measures of unemployment – the U-3 and U-6\nunemployment rates – since 2006. The widely reported and closely followed U-3 measure of\nunemployment was 4.7 percent in December. My own definition of full employment – meaning\nthe unemployment rate associated with full employment – is 4.7 percent, so we have now in\neffect reached the level of unemployment that I think is likely to be sustainable in the long-run.\nThe U-6 measure of unemployment is a broader gauge that includes workers who are\nemployed part time for economic reasons and potential workers who have become discouraged.\nThe measure has fallen quite dramatically, to 9.2 percent, but is still somewhat above prerecession levels. An open question is whether structural changes in the economy, including the\nincreased use of contractors and part-timers in the so-called “gig” economy, are likely to impact\nwhether we see a return to earlier levels of the U-6 measure.\nOne can see other indications that labor markets are continuing to tighten. Figure 6\nshows the unemployment rates since 2006 for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher and those\nwith only a high school diploma. For those with higher educational attainment, the\nunemployment rate is approaching the lows last seen prior to the recession. With the\n5\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunemployment rate for this group at 2.5 percent, and with many jobs requiring higher\neducational attainment, it is fair to expect that we will begin to see pressures in labor markets for\nscarce talent.\nThose with only a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent, which\nis also slightly elevated relative to pre-recession levels. While there are clearly returns to higher\neducational attainment in terms of labor market outcomes, additions to the labor force for the\nhigher-skilled positions will likely require more attention to workforce development and possibly\nmore forms of encouragement to achieve higher educational outcomes.\nFigure 7 shows the 12-month moving average growth in the labor force from 2006 to the\npresent. The labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those\nwho are searching for employment (that is, are unemployed). Recently, increases in payroll\nemployment have resulted in smaller declines in the unemployment rate because the U.S. has\nbeen experiencing relatively strong growth in the labor force. Indeed, an increase in the labor\nforce is a potential benefit of relatively tight labor markets.\nTo look a bit further, Figure 8 shows the 12-month moving average of entry and exit to\nthe labor force as a percentage of the population.1 The growth in the labor force has resulted\nfrom declining exits rather than entries – that is, the percent of the population exiting the labor\nforce has declined more than the percent of the population entering the labor force. Given the\ndemographic trends of a larger cohort of people reaching retirement age, and thus more likely to\nexit the labor force, this trend of declining exits is unlikely to continue to be a source of labor\nforce growth. This in turn implies that, with sustained employment growth, the unemployment\nrate will likely decline faster than it has in recent months.\n\n6\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nTurning to the wage implications, Figure 9 shows growth in two measures of labor\ncompensation from 2006. The first is average hourly earnings, from the payroll survey, which\nsimply divides total wages paid by total hours worked. Because it is an economy-wide average,\ncompositional changes in the labor force across industries and occupations, or across highversus low-wage jobs will influence the growth rate in this measure. The second measure is the\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI) for wages and salaries. Data for the ECI is generated by asking\nfirms about the compensation they must pay for workers in specific occupations, so it can hold\nthe occupational mix constant in a way that the average hourly earnings measure of wages\ncannot. Both series show that wages have been increasing over the past two years, consistent\nwith strong labor market demand.\nOverall, labor market data are consistent with tightening labor markets. With the\nunemployment rate near or below most estimates of full employment, and with wages continuing\nto increase, this part of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate – maximum sustainable employment\n– seems largely fulfilled.\n\nThe Inflation Outlook\nTurning to the inflation side of the Fed’s dual mandate, Figure 10 shows total and core\nPCE inflation rates since 2006. Over the past year, total and core inflation have been increasing;\nhowever, both measures are currently below the Fed’s inflation target of 2 percent – the level\nmonetary policymakers associate with stable prices. My own forecast is for both measures to be\nat 2 percent by the end of 2017. While the Fed’s inflation target is defined in terms of total PCE\n\n7\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\ninflation, other measures of inflation that often anticipate the direction of total PCE inflation\nhave also been trending up recently.\nFigure 11 shows total and core CPI prices since 2006. CPI is focused on the basket of\ngoods purchased by consumers,2 and has increased roughly 0.3 percent faster than the PCE\nmeasure over the past 10 to 15 years.3 Both measures have been increasing over the past two\nyears.\nAlternative inflation measures that try to capture the underlying inflation process by\nremoving outliers are shown in Figure 12. The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank computes the\ntrimmed-mean PCE. By removing the outliers, the series is less volatile – but again it has been\nincreasing over the past two years, although it remains below the 2 percent inflation target. The\nCleveland Federal Reserve Bank provides the trimmed-mean CPI. It, too, has been gradually\nincreasing over the past two years.\nOverall, the inflation indices provide a fairly consistent pattern of gradually increasing\ninflation rates. The combination of tighter labor markets and the gradual increases in inflation\nrates, measured in a variety of ways, should provide more confidence that the economy will\nattain the Federal Reserve’s inflation target over the next year.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nFigure 13 provides the estimates of the likely federal funds rate path from the June and\nDecember Surveys of Primary Dealers, and from Federal Reserve policymakers (FOMC\nparticipants). The dots are the median federal funds rate projections for year-end as provided by\n\n8\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFOMC participants in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) at the June and December\nFOMC meetings. Two observations stand out. First, over the past six months, both the primary\ndealers and the FOMC participants have seen conditions improve sufficiently to expect\ncontinued normalization of monetary policy. Second, market participants continue to expect less\ntightening than do FOMC participants.\nMy own view is that the SEP median forecast seems reasonable if we continue to see real\nGDP growing faster than the so-called “potential” rate. My own forecast is that we will achieve\nboth elements of the dual mandate by the end of 2017 – and as a result, I believe that a still\ngradual but somewhat more regular increase in the federal funds rate will be warranted.\nIn addition to short-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve has a second policy tool at its\ndisposal, the balance sheet, shown in Figure 14. The central bank’s balance sheet has been\nroughly level over the past two years. With the federal funds rate expected to continue its\ngradual rise from the zero lower bound, the risk of returning to the zero lower bound should\ndiminish. The FOMC has published a statement on its policy normalization principles and\nplans.4 As part of the monetary policy normalization strategy, the FOMC should, of course,\ncontinue to consider whether it needs to maintain such a large balance sheet.\n\nConcluding Observations\nGiven where it was in recent years, the economy has shown remarkable progress. We\nnow are quickly approaching employment and inflation levels consistent with both elements of\nthe Fed’s dual mandate – price stability and maximum sustainable employment. I firmly believe\nthat the aggressive policy actions taken by the Fed during the financial crisis and recession made\n9\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, January 9, 2017, at 8:55 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\na huge difference – our economy would not be as healthy as it is and we would thus not be near a\ntightening cycle now if we hadn’t been so aggressive then. As a result, the U.S. is closer to\nachieving its goals for monetary policy than are most other developed countries. Looking ahead,\nI see the Federal Reserve as likely to continue to gradually normalize U.S. monetary policy, even\nas many other countries may need to continue to pursue more expansionary monetary policies.\nThank you for asking me to be with you today. Best wishes for a very good year in 2017.\n\n1\n\nAs previously noted, the labor force is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for\nemployment (that is, are unemployed). Civilians 16 years and over who are not employed or unemployed are categorized as not\nin the labor force. For example, civilians 16 years and over who are without jobs but are not actively seeking work are\nconsidered not in the labor force. Labor force entries are flows into employment and unemployment from not in the labor force.\nLabor force exits are flows from employment and unemployment to not in the labor force. Other inflows and outflows are also\nincluded in this calculation of entries and exits. These include persons just turning 16, estimated deaths, and adjustments to\npopulation totals.\n2\n\nThe CPI is perhaps better known to the public, but its focus on out-of-pocket consumer expenditures makes it somewhat less\ncomprehensive than PCE, which also includes purchases made on behalf of consumers – for example, by health-insurance\ncompanies.\n3\n\nOver the last five years, it has increased only 0.1 percent faster.\n\n4\n\nSee https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPortland Regional Chamber of Commerce\nPortland, Maine\nNovember 15, 2016\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank the staff and members of the Portland Regional\nChamber of Commerce for having me here today to share my views on the economy. At the\noutset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\nThe U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve. Payroll employment growth of\n\n161,000 jobs in October and the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent are two indications that we are\nat or close to most economists’ estimates of “full employment” in the economy. My own\nestimate of the level of unemployment associated with full employment is 4.7 percent – only two\n\n1\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\ntenths less than the current unemployment rate. It has been my expectation that if trends\ncontinue, the remaining gap would close next year.\nI would add that there has also been continued improvement in the outlook for inflation,\nwhich has been below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for much of the recovery. While\nour 2 percent target involves total inflation, it is useful to also examine the “core” inflation\nmeasure that excludes volatile food and energy for a gauge on underlying inflation trends. Core\ninflation (measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index1)\nfluctuated between just 1.3 and 1.4 percent last year, but now stands at 1.7 percent. Should\nrecent exchange rate stabilization and higher oil prices continue, I would expect both total and\ncore PCE inflation to be at or near the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target in 2017.\nWith the economy close to full employment and inflation nearing the Fed’s target, it was\nnot surprising that the futures market’s probability of a tightening in December has been high –\nin the vicinity of 75 percent – with some volatility around the election. Absent significant\nnegative economic news over the next month, the market’s assessment of the likelihood of\ntightening in December seems plausible.\nIn my view, the goal should be to have a continued, sustained economic recovery. To\nachieve that, we must consider the risks inherent in waiting too long to gradually remove\nmonetary accommodation. I would much prefer that tightening be gradual, and that\npolicymakers try to avoid circumstances in which we need to tighten more quickly. My concern\nis that more rapid tightening, were it necessary, could risk disrupting the recovery that is now\nattaining both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate – full employment and an\ninflation target consistent with price stability.\n\n2\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThe Recent Outlook for Labor Markets\nNow I would like to explore with you some of the subtleties and nuances I am seeing in\nlabor markets.\nFigure 1 shows the recent movement of the unemployment rate. The horizontal lines\ndefine the central tendency2 of U.S. monetary policymakers’ expectations for the unemployment\nrate in the long run. Note that over the last year the unemployment rate has remained in the\nnarrow band defined by that range. My own 4.7 percent estimate of full employment places me\nat the lower end of that range. If we dip below 4.7 percent unemployment, we would be running\nthe economy somewhat hot, and probing for how low the unemployment rate could go consistent\nwith our inflation target.\nLooking ahead to the end of 2017, the blue dot represents the unemployment rate that I\nexpect at the end of next year – 4.6 percent. It is also the median unemployment rate expected\nby members of the FOMC, and is the Blue Chip Consensus forecast. The implication is that\nmany forecasters have been expecting us to slightly overshoot the lower bound of the central\ntendency of full employment estimates by the end of next year.\nOf course, the outlook for unemployment is in part tied to the outlook for real GDP\ngrowth next year. The Survey of Professional Forecasters expects next year’s growth to be\nhigher than this year and somewhat above 2 percent, as shown in Figure 2. My own estimate of\nthe sustainable growth rate for the economy is about 1.75 percent, so the growth forecast above\nthat level implies that we are likely to see some further tightening in labor markets.\nFigure 3 shows the percent change from a year earlier for the labor force. The labor\nforce is defined as the sum of those who are currently employed and those who are searching for\n3\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nemployment (that is, are unemployed). When employment grows faster than the labor force, the\nunemployment rate goes down – which has been the pattern for most of this economic recovery.\nHowever, over the past year the unemployment rate has remained stable, despite relatively robust\npayroll employment growth. This is in part explained by relatively strong growth in the labor\nforce over the past year.\nMany of us focus on the net increase in employment in the monthly report, which of late\nhas averaged 100,000 to 200,000 jobs per month. But that net change is the product of a much\nlarger flow of workers into and out of employment and unemployment.\nFor example, the labor force will grow if people not in the labor force – such as students,\nretirees, or discouraged workers – decide to enter the labor force, actively seeking work. Figure\n4 displays the number of people flowing from out of the labor force into employment, as a share\nof the labor force. Over the recovery period, there has been a dramatic increase in this share as\nthe figure shows, accounting for much of the growth in the labor force over that period. But\nmore recently there has been a leveling off of these flows, albeit at relatively high levels.\nHowever, this dynamic does not account for the levelling off of the unemployment rate\nover the past year. Figure 5 focuses on labor market transitions over the past two years, and\nshows that, more recently, the number of people flowing into employment after being out of the\nlabor force has leveled off. Rather, the levelling off of the unemployment rate in the last year\nseems to reflect the recent decline in the number of people flowing in the opposite direction –\nthat is, fewer people are leaving employment to step out of the labor force.\nA reason to expect that the growth in the labor force may not be as robust going forward\nis the continuing impact of the aging of the workforce. Figure 6 shows the share of the labor\n4\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nforce between the ages of 25 and 54, which has been declining, while the share of the labor force\nbetween ages 55 and 65 has been rising. As more baby boomers reach retirement age, we should\nsee a continued increase in the number of workers shifting from employed to retired and thus out\nof the labor force.\nReflecting that ongoing demographic transition, Figure 7 shows that the labor force\nparticipation rate has been declining for more than 15 years. While the labor force participation\nrate leveled off recently, these demographic changes will almost surely continue, and make it\nunlikely that the labor force will grow as quickly as recently experienced.\nIt is certainly good news that the labor force has grown more rapidly of late, and that\nworkers have been drawn from out of the labor force into employment. But this trend is likely to\nbe limited going forward by the demographic changes in the workforce. As a result, if the\neconomy grows even somewhat faster than potential, as most forecasters are expecting, the\ncorresponding increases in employment are likely to be accompanied by further declines in the\nunemployment rate. Since the unemployment rate is already close to its full employment level,\nfurther declines would increase the risk of overshooting what is likely to be a sustainable\nunemployment rate in the longer run. That outcome could lead at some point to the need for a\nmore rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation.\n\nWages and Prices\nAs labor markets have tightened recently, we have seen signs in many indicators that\nwages and prices are rising in response. Figure 8 shows that core PCE prices have been rising –\n1.7 percent in the most recent year-over-year reading, which is just three tenths shy of our 2\n5\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\npercent target for total inflation. The Boston Fed forecast has us reaching 2 percent core PCE\ninflation next year, slightly above the estimates of the median Summary of Economic Projections\n(SEP) forecast for core PCE.\nFigure 9 shows the average probabilities that Survey of Professional Forecasters\nparticipants assign to core PCE falling into each of 10 ranges in 2017, as of the fourth quarter of\n2016. The chart shows that on average, forecasters assign a significant probability (70 percent)\nto inflation falling in a range near 2 percent – between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent.\nFigure 10 shows the forecast for total PCE inflation. Total PCE inflation is still being\nheld down by the impact of earlier declines in oil prices and the rising value of the dollar. As\nthese effects have subsided, total PCE has been rising. The Boston forecast is currently at 2\npercent for the end of 2017 while the median SEP is slightly lower. While total PCE could still\nbe impacted by shocks, Figure 11 shows that since the beginning of 2016, the exchange rate has\nbeen roughly stable, while oil prices have risen on balance. Thus the combined effects of these\ntwo factors should act to increase inflation relative to previous years.\nThere is also evidence that wage pressures are beginning to show up more convincingly\nin the data. Figure 12 shows that average hourly earnings have been gradually rising as labor\nmarkets have tightened. Over the past year average hourly earnings have risen 2.8 percent,\nbelow what we saw prior to the Great Recession but above the 2 percent growth we experienced\nearlier in the recovery.\nIn sum, inflation appears at last to be trending toward the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ntarget for total inflation. The Boston Fed forecast expects both the total and core PCE inflation\nmeasures to hit 2 percent over the next year. Progress to date and the expectation of further\n6\n\n\f*EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 15, 2016, at 8:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or UPON DELIVERY*\n\nprogress likely explain, in part, why markets have priced in a high probability of a rate hike in\nDecember.\n\nConcluding Observations\nAt the September FOMC meeting, I voted to increase interest rates, arguing that if we\nwaited too long to raise rates we could place at risk the sustainability of the recovery. I was\nconcerned that waiting could risk the need to raise rates faster and more than desired at some\npoint, and I felt that this was a risk that could be reduced by removing a bit of accommodation\nearlier. At the FOMC meeting earlier this month, however, I felt that the changes in the FOMC\nstatement were well aligned with the notion (and the market perception) of a high likelihood of\ntightening in December. As a result, I did not dissent.\nGoing forward, I will be attuned to assessing whether my forecast – continued progress\ntoward achieving our inflation target and employment goals – is on track.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and\nenergy prices.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n60th Economic Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 14, 2016\n\nGood morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 60th Economic\nConference. I am looking forward to the presentations and discussions over the coming days.\nWhile much has been written about the causes and severity of the so-called Great\nRecession, much less has been written to date about the not-so-great recovery that has followed.\nWith this conference, we hope to fill some of that gap – as we discuss papers and analysis\ncovering some of the key anomalies in this recovery.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWe are looking forward to hearing from our keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Chair\nJanet Yellen, a little later today. I would also like to welcome some of my fellow Fed\npolicymakers who are joining us. It is wonderful to have them here, as well as all of our\npresenters and discussants, and all of you who are attending.\nAt a high level, what are the facts that make this recovery unusual? First, during this\nrecovery, growth in real GDP has been quite subdued – with growth rates that are percentage\npoints slower than the historical average. Second, despite the tepid growth, the unemployment\nrate has fallen quite a bit faster than many expected. And finally, inflation has lingered\nstubbornly below the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent.\nUnderstanding why this recovery has been different is important for monetary\npolicymakers. Understanding the sources of the difference will shape expectations going\nforward, views on how to calibrate policy, and perspectives on the extent to which monetary and\nother macro policies can support a return to more normal levels of long-run growth.\nQuestions abound. Is a slow recovery the unavoidable consequence of a severe\nrecession? Or of a financial crisis? What role is played by the changing demographics in the\nUnited States? Will what may seem like temporary anomalies become the “new normal” for the\neconomy or economic cycles? Answers to questions like these will help us understand whether\nfirms and households have changed behavior in ways that are likely to be more permanent than\ntransitory, whether slow growth in productivity is transitory or permanent, and whether recent\ntrends in personal saving behavior are likely to persist well into the future. In view of recent\nglobal inflation trends, the answers to these questions also have bearing on whether the global\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neconomy will continue to face bouts of undesirably low – rather than high – inflation,\nchallenging policymakers in novel ways.\nAgain, the answers to these questions not only impact our understanding of the economy\nduring this recovery, but may also have important consequences for setting policy well into the\nfuture. For example, will a persistent change to long-run growth and long-run real interest rates\nrequire that nontraditional monetary policy actions become part of the traditional “tool kit” of\ncentral banks? Has this recovery changed views around using monetary policy rather than fiscal\npolicy to address slow recoveries? And does the experience of a persistently slow rebound alter\nviews on how quickly to address any emerging risks to the current recovery?\nThis morning, I am going to briefly touch on some of the “puzzles” that we have asked\nthe presenters to address at this conference – leaving the difficult job of answering the questions\nto our paper givers and discussants. I will then briefly examine how some of these puzzles have\nimpacted financial markets and how we might interpret financial market reactions to this\n“nonconformist” recovery.\nBefore I begin, let me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those\nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nEconomic Anomalies and the Current Recovery\nFigure 1 displays the pace of the recoveries from the last three recessions. This recovery\nhas been notably weaker than the previous two. Growth has averaged just a little over 2 percent\nduring the current recovery. The slope of the line is quite a bit flatter, but relatively constant –\nthat is, there has been no substantial surge in growth, as sometimes occurs at the beginning of\nrecoveries, but rather a decidedly gradual recovery of GDP from a very deep recession.\nDespite the only gradual increase in real GDP, the unemployment rate has fallen faster\nthan in the previous two recoveries. Given the slower growth, this is somewhat surprising.\nGiven the unusually high unemployment rate coming out of the Great Recession, this more rapid\ndecline in unemployment was certainly welcome – but the pairing of slower, sustained real GDP\ngrowth with a rapid decline in the unemployment rate is one of the clear puzzles of the recovery.\nThe falling unemployment rate has also been accompanied by falling labor force participation, as\ndemographic aging of the U.S. workforce causes people to leave the labor force. However, as\nFigure 2 shows, even within age cohorts there have been declines in participation rates during\nthe recovery, with declines in the labor force participation of both prime working age men and\nwomen. These trends may have implications for how we might expect the economy to evolve,\ngoing forward.\nAt least one of the reasons for relatively slow growth has been the pattern of the saving\nrate. As Figure 3 shows, the earlier recoveries (the periods following the recession shading on\nthe chart) were accompanied by periods of secular decline in the personal saving rate. This\nallowed for somewhat stronger consumer spending, which served as one of the foundations of\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nearlier recoveries. At least to date, the decline in the saving rate prior to the Great Recession has\nbeen followed by a higher saving rate, which may suggest different savings behavior stemming\nfrom the experience of the Great Recession. Should this pattern persist, it has implications going\nforward for consumption patterns and the economy more broadly.\nCore inflation has also remained subdued during the recovery from the Great Recession,\nas shown in Figure 4. However, core inflation was also below 2 percent after the 2001\nrecession, but returned to a bit above 2 percent once labor markets tightened. In contrast, while\nunemployment is now quite close to most economists’ estimates of the natural rate, the core PCE\ninflation rate has remained consistently below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over most\nof the recovery period, and currently stands at 1.7 percent.\nThe real federal funds rate in the current recovery also differs markedly from previous\nrecoveries, as shown in Figure 5. Reflecting the depth of the Great Recession, the real federal\nfunds rate has been significantly lower, and consistently negative, in contrast to the two earlier\nrecoveries. The need for more monetary policy accommodation is not surprising, given the\nseverity of the recession. What is surprising, however, is that even near full employment, the\nreal rate is still so much lower than in the earlier recoveries. By the fourth year of those two\nearlier recoveries, the real federal funds rate had almost reached 2 percent (following the 2001\nrecession) or had exceeded 2 percent (following the 1991 recession).\nIn contrast, in the current recovery the real federal funds rate has not rebounded,\nremaining quite negative. And as Figure 6 shows, now seven years into the recovery, the real\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfederal funds rate remains below the nadir of the earlier two recoveries, even though the\neconomy has returned to near full employment.\n\nEconomic Anomalies and Asset Prices\nThe very short-term real federal funds rate is not the only segment of the yield curve that\nis unusually low, as shown in Figure 7. The 10-year Treasury rate minus 10-year inflation\nexpectations (from the Survey of Professional Forecasters) remains unusually low, even late in\nthe recovery. There are a number of possible reasons for this, including the Federal Reserve’s\nholdings of a significant quantity of longer-duration Treasury bonds; depressed long rates\nglobally, stemming from weak national economies inducing asset purchases by their central\nbanks; and concerns that central banks in many parts of the world may have difficulty achieving\ntheir inflation targets.\nHowever, looking at Figure 8, it is noteworthy that in the seventh year of the recovery,\nthe 10-year real U.S. Treasury yield remains negative – in other words, purchasers of 10-year\nTreasuries are willing to accept a return that does not even compensate them for the inflation\nexpected over the holding period. This suggests a lack of confidence in U.S. and global growth\nprospects, and in the ability of policy authorities to offset weak growth.\nWith both the real federal funds rate and the longer-term Treasury rate unusually low,\none might also expect other asset prices to behave differently than in earlier recoveries. Figure 9\nshows the price to operating earnings ratio for the S&P 500 in the period covering the past three\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecoveries. While the price to earnings ratio for stocks is elevated, it still remains well below\nlevels reached prior to 2001.\nFigure 10 shows an index of price to rent for residential housing. While the index has\nbeen trending up more recently, it still remains much lower than in the years leading up to the\nGreat Recession.\nFigure 11 shows real commercial real estate prices during the past three recessions and\nrecoveries. The recovery from the 1991 recession saw declines in real commercial real estate\nprices at the beginning of the recovery; even seven years later, prices had not returned to their\nlevel in the trough, in real terms. Of course, commercial real estate had been a major cause of\nthat recession, spurring significant bank failures. Unlike the 2001 recession, in which\ncommercial real estate suffered only collateral damage, it was many years before commercial\nreal estate prices stabilized after the 1991 recession. Interestingly, the past two recoveries have\ncontained relatively rapid appreciation in commercial real estate prices.\nFigure 12 shows the overall capitalization rate for commercial real estate over the past\ntwo recessions and recoveries. Cap rates now stand at historic lows.\nOverall, anomalies in this recovery are leaving an imprint on only some financial asset\nclasses. Price to earnings ratios for stocks and price to rent for residential real estate are only\nsomewhat elevated and are well below previous peaks in these series. In contrast, 10-year\nTreasury rates and commercial real estate capitalization rates are unusually low relative to the\npast. Figure 13 shows that the duration of the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account\n(SOMA) holdings rose as asset-purchase programs increased the holdings of longer-term\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 14, 2016 at 8:30 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nTreasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. More recently, there has been some decline in\nthe duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio as the previously purchased, longer-term\nsecurities holdings continued to age. However, if one were concerned about the historically low\n10-year Treasury and commercial real estate capitalization rates, perhaps because of potential\nfinancial stability concerns, the balance sheet composition could be adjusted to steepen the yield\ncurve.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThis recovery has been full of surprises, most of which have not been good. Hopefully,\nthe discussions that we have over the next two days will help us better understand these\nanomalies, and whether they are likely to have a more permanent impact on the economy. They\nmay also have implications for the pricing of financial assets as the policy normalization process\nproceeds.\nWhile one must always be cautious about assuming that current trends reflect something\ndifferent from historical experience, it is important to consider whether this time has indeed been\ndifferent. If it has, then the lessons from this recovery – perhaps an understanding of a “new\nnormal” environment – may very well impact how we should be thinking about monetary policy\ngoing forward.\nThank you.\n\n8\n\n\f",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Exploring the Economy’s Progress\nand Outlook”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSouth Shore Chamber of Commerce\nQuincy, Massachusetts\nSeptember 9, 2016\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank Peter Forman and the members of the South Shore\nChamber of Commerce for having me here today. At the outset, let me note as I always do that\nthe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nOver the past year the United States economy has remained fairly resilient despite the\neconomic “drag” emanating from overseas. Global concerns – including a more significant\nslowdown in China – caused some market volatility at the beginning of this year, and the United\nKingdom’s vote to leave the European Union has refocused attention on continued lethargic\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngrowth in Europe. In fact, the International Monetary Fund recently downgraded its growth\nforecast for the world economy. The expansion in many developed countries has remained so\nweak that their central banks have put in place even more stimulative monetary policies.\nDespite these headwinds from abroad, labor markets in the U.S. continue to gradually\ntighten, and inflation is slowly returning to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. In\nfact, it is quite possible that we will reach or even exceed full employment over the course of the\nnext year.\nGiven how near the U.S. economy is to reaching the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate\nfrom Congress (stable prices and maximum sustainable employment), it is reasonable to ask\nwhether the current degree of monetary policy accommodation – historically low interest rates –\nremains necessary. My personal view, based on data that we have received to date, is that a\nreasonable case can be made for continuing to pursue a gradual normalization of monetary\npolicy.\nAs usual, there are some conflicting signals in the economic data that came out this\nsummer. For example, payroll employment has been quite strong, averaging 232,000 net new\njobs per month over the past three months, and just over 200,000 per month over the past year.1\nWhat’s more, that rate remains significantly higher than long-run labor force growth. Consistent\nwith the tightening in labor markets, measures of wage and salary growth have been increasing\nsomewhat, albeit from still relatively low levels.\nIn contrast, real GDP growth for the first two quarters has been disappointing, averaging\naround only 1 percent, well below the pace the Federal Reserve’s policymakers were expecting\nwhen we first raised rates last December.2 However, I would observe that at least part of this\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nweakness reflects temporary inventory adjustments that are likely to be reversed in the second\nhalf of this year. While final sales (real GDP net of inventories) expanded 1.8 percent a quarter\nso far this year, real GDP was much weaker, which reflected a run-down of inventories. The\ncombination of the relatively strong domestic demand and the restocking of inventories should\nprovide a basis for growth to exceed 2 percent over the next two quarters. This will increase the\nrisk that the unemployment rate will be pushed over time to a point below most estimates of full\nemployment – an outcome that is likely to prove unsustainable over time.\n\nOverview of Recent Data\nFigure 1 shows the real GDP growth that economic forecasters participating in the Blue\nChip forecast were predicting for the first two quarters of 2016, as of the middle of December\n2015, and the actual results. Clearly, the first two quarters did not live up to the forecasts. The\nBlue Chip forecasters were expecting growth in the first two quarters to be comfortably above 2\npercent, but as I noted a moment ago, actual growth fell short of that. The forecasts overpredicted the strength of growth in each of the first two quarters by more than 1 percentage point.\nFigure 2 shows real GDP and real final sales growth in the first two quarters of this year.\nReal final sales give a better reading on the demand for goods and services in the U.S. because\nthey exclude inventory fluctuations, which can affect GDP in the short term. The figure shows\nthat inventories were a drag on GDP in the first half of the year as a sizable portion of demand\nwas met by reducing inventories. Second-quarter real final sales growth was 2.4 percent,\nindicating that these inventory adjustments – rather than a weak underlying economy – explain\nmuch of the economy’s apparent softness.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 3 provides real final sales to domestic purchasers, which removes the impact of\nboth net exports and inventories from the growth in real GDP. This represents the demand\ncoming from U.S. firms, government, and consumers. Over the past two years, real final sales to\ndomestic purchasers grew at a healthy 2.6 percent. So the data show that the domestic economy\nhas been performing quite well despite the effects of a strong dollar and weak growth among our\ntrading partners. I expect some continuing drag from foreign activity, but underlying domestic\nstrength is likely to be sufficient to engender continued improvement.\nFigure 4 shows several forecasts for the third quarter. Clearly forecasters are expecting\nthird quarter growth to notch an increase. Both the August Blue Chip Forecast and the August\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters predict growth well above 2 percent – and the “nowcast”\nstatistical forecast by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank (GDPNow3) expects an even stronger\nthird quarter.\n\nOverview of Labor Market Data\nPayroll employment growth of late can be described as somewhat choppy, as depicted in\nFigure 5. We saw a very weak payroll employment report in May, followed by two fairly\nsignificant increases in payroll employment in the June and July reports. With last Friday’s\nreport for August payroll employment showing an increase of 151,000 jobs, average monthly\npayroll growth is 232,000 jobs over the past three months and 204,000 jobs over the past twelve\nmonths. Either figure is well above the 80,000 to 100,000 jobs a month that monetary\npolicymakers estimate are needed just to keep the unemployment rate constant over time.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, the data we have seen over the summer continue to reflect a tightening of the\nU.S. labor market. The national unemployment rate shown in Figure 6 is now 4.9 percent. As\nthe chart shows, the unemployment rate has declined steadily over the past four years.\nPolicymakers’ views of the unemployment rate that will prevail in the long run – indicated by the\ncentral tendency of FOMC participants shown in the chart shading – were 4.7 percent to 5\npercent at the June FOMC meeting. So we are currently at or close to the estimates of full\nemployment held by FOMC participants.\nLooking forward, most forecasters expect that labor markets will continue to tighten and\nthe unemployment rate will continue to fall. The Blue Chip consensus forecast for the\nunemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is 4.7 percent (see Figure 7), which is the\nsame as my own forecast for the end of this year, and is equal to my estimate of full\nemployment. The Blue Chip consensus forecast for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter\nof 2017 is 4.5 percent, somewhat below the FOMC participants’ consensus view of the long-run\nunemployment rate. The figure shows that by the fourth quarter of 2017, the average of the 10\nhighest unemployment rate forecasts among the roughly 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip survey is\nstill below 5 percent.\nAs the labor market has tightened, we have seen modest evidence of the upward pressure\non wages and salaries that would support inflation reaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal.\nFigure 8 provides wages and salaries from the employment cost survey and average hourly\nearnings from the payroll employment survey.4 The series have been gradually rising over the\npast two years, although they still remain at levels that are low by historical standards. However,\nmodest increases in wages and salaries seem to me consistent with tightness in labor markets\nbeginning to appear more strongly in the wage data.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRisks to the Outlook\nOne potential concern is that while our best guess for the economy is consistent with\ncontinued improvement, the economy faces particularly risky global conditions. And this adds\nan element of risk to actions that would further normalize monetary policy. Some observers\nargue that the fragile global economic situation could justify an even more patient U.S. monetary\npolicy, simply on risk management grounds.\nIn this debate I would offer the observation that, while it is important to acknowledge the\npresence of global risks, market indicators have so far provided little evidence of outsized risks.\nFor example, Figure 9 shows the VIX market volatility index.5 While the index was elevated at\nthe beginning of the year in response to concerns related to China and more recently in June\nreflecting concerns about the potential impact from the Brexit vote, the current value of the index\nis near its low for the year. Given the number of global events over the past nine months, the\nVIX highlights the resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of potential shocks from abroad.\nIf an elevated risk of a severe financial shock existed, one might expect it to be reflected\nin stock prices, particularly prices in those markets that might be most sensitive to global shocks.\nHowever, Figure 10 shows that the S&P has more than recovered from its sharp declines earlier\nin the year. Similarly, emerging market stock prices have made very substantial improvements\nover the same period. The same cannot be said of the Euro STOXX index, which has not\nrecouped its losses of earlier in the year. This likely reflects the ongoing weakness in the Euro\narea. The figure suggests that, with the exception of Europe, the potential concern with fragile\nglobal economies does not seem to be strongly priced into financial assets, at least to date.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, not all the risk is on the downside. It is important to note that an overheated\neconomy – one that significantly exceeds sustainable output and employment – would pose risks\nto maintaining full employment over time. Here history is instructive – Figure 11 shows the\nunemployment rate and the effective federal funds rate for the past 50 years, along with recession\nshading. The chart suggests that monetary policy has not been a precise tool, capable of gently\nguiding the economy back to full employment in periods when we have exceeded sustainable,\nfull employment. As shown, the federal funds rate frequently peaks prior to a recession as the\neconomy threatens to overheat, with unemployment potentially dipping below its long-run\nsustainable rate. The figure suggests that the calibration of monetary policy during such a\ntightening cycle is difficult: The U.S. economy often slows down more than is optimal,\nfrequently resulting in a recession.\nThis historical pattern illustrates the difficulty of slowing the economy to a sustainable\nrate without going too far and causing a recession. This problem could be compounded if delays\nin tightening earlier in the cycle lead to conditions that require more rapid increases in interest\nrates later in the cycle, risking a more pronounced slowing in growth and rise in unemployment.\nA second risk of waiting too long to tighten is that some asset markets become too\nebullient. Figure 12 shows that real commercial real estate prices have risen quite rapidly over\nthe past five years, particularly for multifamily properties. Because commercial real estate is\nwidely held in the portfolios of leveraged institutions, commercial real estate cycles can amplify\nthe impact of economic downturns as financial institutions need to write down the value of loans\nand cut back on lending to maintain their capital ratios.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, the risks to the forecast are becoming increasingly two-sided, in my view.\nWeakness emanating from abroad poses short-term downside risks to the domestic U.S.\neconomy. However, the U.S. economy has been relatively resistant to shocks from abroad of\nlate, as evidenced recently by the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Yet as I have described today,\nthere are also longer-term risks from significantly overshooting the U.S. economy’s growth –\ngiven the bluntness of monetary policy tools, and the possibility of growing imbalances in some\nasset classes.\n\nConcluding Observations\nFor some time now, we at the Federal Reserve have taken a very patient approach to\nmonetary policy normalization, reflecting the low-inflation environment and more recently the\nglobal shocks experienced over the past year. However, with the current degree of monetary\npolicy accommodation, the U.S. economy continues to grow fast enough to yield continued\nimprovement in labor markets. That degree of accommodation increases the chances of driving\nthe core inflation rate closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, but it also increases the\nchances of overheating the economy.\nSo if we want to ensure that we remain at full employment, gradual tightening is likely to\nbe appropriate. A failure to continue on the path of gradual removal of accommodation could\nshorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of this recovery.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 9, 2016 at 8:15 A.M.

I would like to thank our hosts, the Shanghai Advanced Institute of\nFinance, for inviting me to participate in this exchange of ideas and perspectives.\nLet me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here in Beijing to share some observations. Let me begin with the\nobvious: growth in the global economy has continued to underwhelm. In response to these\ndisappointing economic results, central banks in many developed countries have reduced shortand long-term rates to historic lows. Indeed, a number of countries now have negative rates on a\nsignificant proportion of their sovereign debt. In the financial sector, the low rate environment\nhas continued to challenge the business models of many financial intermediaries, and troubles\nwithin some banking organizations continue to present downside risks in many parts of the\nworld, particularly in Europe. And it is not only developed economies that are facing challenges;\nmany emerging economies are still suffering from the decline in global commodity prices which\nhas resulted, in part, from the slow growth across much of the world.\nWeak global growth has hindered the United States expansion since the end of the socalled Great Recession. The most recent two quarters have been no exception, with GDP growth\nbelow 2 percent in both the first and second quarters of 2016.\nYet despite the weak growth in the U.S. economy, by historical standards U.S. labor\nmarkets are now at, or close to, the rate of unemployment that most economists consider full\nemployment. And, while “core” inflation (using the Personal Consumption Expenditures price\nindex or PCE1) remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, there have been gradual\nincreases in our core measure of PCE inflation – from readings of 1.3 to 1.4 percent last year to\n1.6 percent currently.\nWith the U.S. economy closing in on full employment, and edging closer to the 2 percent\ninflation target, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate – stable prices and maximum sustainable\nemployment – is likely to be achieved relatively soon. But, considering the aforementioned\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nchallenges in the global economy, important questions confront monetary policymakers in the\nUnited States. When and how quickly should the Fed normalize interest rates? And what is the\n“normal” rate?\nGiven the persistently weak economic growth in the United States during the recovery\nfrom the Great Recession, it has been appropriate to be patient about normalizing rates. The\nFOMC raised short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point last December and has yet to\nraise rates again this year. I have often spoken about the appropriateness, and clear benefits, of a\npatient and gradual approach to increasing rates. One benefit is that gradual tightening allows\nfurther progress in labor markets, helping those who are still unemployed or temporarily out of\nthe labor force. In turn, tighter labor markets should help the inflation rate return to the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target, which is especially important as many countries around the\nworld are contending with low inflation rates, which tends to depress our own inflation rate to\nsome extent.\nBy slowly normalizing rates, we would hope to continue to support growth. However,\nkeeping interest rates low for a long time is not without risks. Today I will focus my remarks on\none of those risks.\nProlonged periods of very low rates pose challenges for some financial intermediaries\nand for households who derive significant income from savings. Because of their crucial role in\nfacilitating economic activity, we must be attuned to the health of financial intermediaries.\nMany financial intermediaries derive income from spread lending – borrowing at low short-term\nrates and lending or investing at a higher return over longer periods of time. However, in an\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nenvironment where both short and long rates are quite low, the profit margins of financial\nintermediaries can shrink.2\nMeanwhile, households can also be challenged by low rates prevailing over long periods.\nSaving sufficient funds for retirement, for example, is much more challenging if low-risk\ninvestments generate very little return.\nFirms and households faced with long periods of low returns may react by “reaching for\nyield” – that is, buying riskier assets than one would otherwise, in order to achieve a desired\nprofit or savings goal. The challenge is that in a pervasive low-rate environment, the returns on\nrisky assets are also reduced. A key risk to an environment characterized by reaching for yield is\nthat, should a large negative shock occur, firms and households would be exposed to greater\nlosses through their holdings of riskier assets than they would be if they were not reaching for\nyield. To the extent that reaching for yield is more likely in a low interest rate environment,\npolicymakers may need to weigh this particular risk related to low rates against the benefits of\nsupporting the economy.3\nToday in my remarks I would like to explore the potential risks of the rapid increase in\ncommercial real estate prices in the United States. As interest rates have remained low,\ncommercial real estate prices have risen; capitalization or “cap” rates on real estate (representing\nthe ratio of net operating income produced by a property to the price paid4) have fallen to historic\nlows; and foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate has increased. This raises a possible\nconcern that investors may be engaged in excessive risk-taking. Should the U.S. economy\nexperience a large negative shock, this could pose a problem for the stability of the U.S.\neconomy. Current cap rates the United States indicate that a long period of very low interest\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrates can add to potential downside risks, and in my view this suggests that financial stability\nconcerns could be a consideration in how long policymakers wait before resuming the gradual\nremoval of monetary accommodation.\n\nCommercial Real Estate and Financial Stability\nLooking at the data, Figure 1 shows the percentage change in real commercial real estate\nprices and real GDP in the U.S. over the past 30 years. Over that period, we have had three\nrecessions in the United States (shaded on the figure). The most severe one – the Great\nRecession – was clearly exacerbated by declines in real estate prices, both residential and\ncommercial. Because these real estate assets were important collateral for loans, and because\nthere were also significant holdings of derivative financial instruments tied to real estate, many\nfinancial institutions experienced large losses. These real estate related losses within financial\nintermediaries led to credit availability problems for households and businesses that contributed\nto the severity of the Great Recession. Weakened banks may constrain lending to maintain their\ncapital ratios, significantly reducing access to credit for all but the most credit-worthy\nborrowers.5\nThe U.S. recession in the early 1990s also had a significant real estate component. Many\nof the initial problems in that recession began in the New England region, where large\ncommercial real estate exposures created problems for financial institutions. As commercial real\nestate prices fell, we saw “fire sales” of commercial real estate properties as financial institutions\nunwound their positions. Eventually, the problems in commercial real estate extended to both\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncoasts and the Southwest region of the U.S., and resulted in what then Federal Reserve Board\nChairman Alan Greenspan referred to as “headwinds” in monetary policy.6\nIn contrast, the recession in 2001 did not have a large impact on financial institutions,\nlargely because the financial upheaval centered on equities, an asset against which financial\ninstitutions were not highly leveraged. As a result, the financial sector was not suffering large\nlosses and pulling back on lending, so credit availability was not particularly constrained. The\nrecession was relatively mild by historical standards, and the recovery proceeded relatively\nquickly.\nThese differing experiences in U.S. economic downturns, as well as in other countries,\nshow us that it is critically important to closely monitor and understand the assets held in highly\nleveraged financial institutions.\nFigure 2 utilizes the Financial Accounts of the United States to show the distribution of\nexposures to commercial real estate among lenders. Out of the $3.6 trillion in total commercial\nmortgages and multifamily residential mortgages, about $1.9 trillion are held by the banking\nsystem. Among asset classes held by leveraged institutions, commercial real estate is large –\nalthough it is not particularly concentrated in larger institutions.\nSuch exposures, by themselves, are unlikely to trigger financial stability problems. But if\nthe economy weakens, a large decline in commercial real estate collateral values could lead to\npayment defaults, and large losses to banks.7 This would have downstream effects on credit\navailability to firms and households, as mentioned a moment ago. The precipitating conditions\nwould conform well to the classic determinants of financial stability problems: collateral values\nfall, and payment streams are interrupted.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, commercial real estate problems can increase the amplitude of distress during an\neconomic downturn. And I would like to discuss today some data that highlight recent trends in\ncommercial real estate.\n\nRecent Trends in Commercial Real Estate\nSeveral factors other than low interest rates have made commercial real estate an\nattractive asset class at this time. Figure 3 shows the occupancy rate for apartments in the\nUnited States. The dark green shading, which reflects at least 96 percent occupancy, shows that\nmany regions of the country are now close to full occupancy. This is particularly true on the two\ncoasts, around some of the larger cities. It is also quite striking that some of the areas severely\nimpacted by the decline in real estate prices during the Great Recession, such as Florida, now\nhave relatively high occupancy rates – reflecting in part the movement into rental units of former\nfinancially distressed homeowners.\nGiven the high occupancy rates in many regions of the U.S., it is not surprising that rents\nhave been increasing, as shown in Figure 4. The dark green shading represents an annual\nincrease in rents of at least 6 percent. Again, the two coasts are among the areas experiencing\nhigh occupancy rates, and tend to have rents increasing more rapidly.\nWith high occupancy rates, rising rents, and very low interest rates on alternative assets,\nit is not surprising that commercial real estate prices have been on the rise. Figure 5 shows that\nU.S. commercial real estate prices across the four property types have each experienced rapid\nappreciation in real terms, although only the apartment price index is above the 2007 peak.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nInterestingly, retail commercial real estate prices have continued to rise, despite some of the\nlong-run changes affecting that property type such as the rise of online shopping. Particularly\nstriking is how much multifamily property prices have risen.\nIt is also worth noting that commercial real estate properties exhibited very significant\nprice declines during the Great Recession. Certainly much attention has been focused on the role\nplayed by residential real estate price declines, which were important factors contributing to the\nseverity of the recession. But commercial property price declines also were significant.\nFigure 6 shows real commercial real estate prices by region. Among the five regions\nshown, the U.S. Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and West have seen the most rapid price\nincreases in recent years – and increases that are considerably more rapid than in other parts of\nthe country.\nFigure 7 shows that real multifamily property prices have been particularly robust in six\nmajor metro markets.8,9 In Greater Boston, where I live and work, there have been rapid\nincreases in multifamily prices; I am reminded of this when I pass by numerous construction\nsites each day to and from my office. On top of low interest rates and rapidly increasing rents,\nBoston in particular has a large number of universities and robust high tech industries that have\nbeen attractive to millennials and have helped boost the demand for apartments.\nFigure 8 shows the capitalization or cap rates10 for the various property types. Given that\nincreases in the market prices of commercial properties have outpaced rent increases (and thus\nnet operating income), cap rates have been declining and are quite low by historical standards.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 9 shows the cap rate for apartments and the 10-year Treasury rate. As the 10-year\nTreasury rate has fallen, along with rates on sovereign debt in much of the world, households and\nfirms have been turning to the relatively high returns possible in real estate. This should not be\nsurprising; one of the ways that monetary policy works in a low-interest-rate environment is to\nencourage investors to move into somewhat riskier asset class categories, to stimulate economic\nactivity. Of course, should macroeconomic conditions change, there is a potential for large\nlosses to those who moved into riskier assets, as previously discussed.\nFigure 10 shows the increase in foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate. The\nUnited States is not alone in being in a low-interest-rate environment. Japan and parts of Europe\nhave negative interest rates, and in some countries the negative rates extend well out on the yield\ncurve. With the relatively strong U.S. economy, foreign investors have been attracted to an asset\nclass that still provides a relatively high rate of return. As the chart shows, there have been\nsignificant inflows of funds from both Europe and Asia.\n\nPotential Implications\nHaving explored some of the relevant data, it is useful to think through the potential\nimplications. In my view, commercial real estate is, by itself, unlikely to trigger financial\nstability problems. But should prevailing economic conditions change in response to a large\nnegative economic shock, commercial real estate prices could decline relatively quickly, leading\nto large losses at leveraged firms. Because commercial real estate debt is widely held by\ndepository institutions, this could cause a contraction of credit – similar to the credit crunch\nexperience in the United States in the early 1990s. While Figure 2 showed that the holding of\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncommercial real estate loans is relatively dispersed, it is an important asset class for most\nleveraged institutions.\nFigure 11 shows the percentage of commercial real estate loans outstanding held by\nbanks with commercial real estate loans in excess of 350 percent of their risk-based capital, for\nbanks under $1 billion in assets, in each U.S. state. This includes owner-occupied as well as\nnon-owner-occupied property. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is not used for purposes\nof the commercial real estate guidance in bank supervision, but can be an issue for the economy\nif falling real estate prices occur and make it difficult to roll over or expand credit. In some of\nthe coastal states, a high percentage of commercial real estate loans made by banks with under\n$1 billion in assets are held in institutions that have a commercial real estate to risk-based capital\nratio above 350 percent.\nSo the concern I put forward today is the scenario where widespread declines in\ncommercial real estate prices could ripple through the financial sector and lead to a significant\ntightening of credit for many borrowers. And given that, I would pose the natural next question:\nif one agrees that there is building pressure in commercial real estate, should it have any bearing\non the setting of monetary policy?\nU.S. monetary policymakers should focus on achieving maximum employment consistent\nwith stable prices currently, of course, but also over time. Very low interest rates may move the\neconomy closer to the central bank’s dual mandate goals more quickly than would higher interest\nrates, but it is important to evaluate “at what cost.”\nWhen the economy is far away from achieving the dual mandate goals, asset prices tend\nto be weak – providing an added rationale for accommodative policy. However, when the\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neconomy is close to achieving the dual mandate – as the U.S. economy is now – very low rates\nmay cause the economy to attain and exceed sustainable employment, risking greater imbalances\nthat could negatively impact the economy in the future. And this may be an unfavorable tradeoff.\nFigure 12 shows the U.S. unemployment rate for the past 10 years, along with the\nCongressional Budget Office estimate of full employment. After the Great Recession, the\nunemployment rate was very high, and the potential negative effects of low interest rates on asset\nprices were quite low given the depressed market for most assets. However, over time the\nunemployment rate has fallen, and is now within many estimates of full employment – and some\nasset prices, such as for commercial real estate, have risen quite dramatically.\nShould the macroeconomic environment change, one could envision a scenario where\ncommercial real estate prices could decline significantly if underlying rents, occupancy rates, and\nmarket interest rates become less favorable. The probability of such a reassessment is, of course,\neach market participant’s to judge, and I am not making a prediction of this outcome, to be sure.\nBut I have emphasized that such a revaluation, in conjunction with an economic downturn, could\nmake a recession worse than it would have been had policymakers normalized interest rates more\nrapidly.\nIn other words, a somewhat faster move to rate normalization may defer somewhat how\nquickly we achieve the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability, but could\nreduce the risk of a larger divergence from the dual mandate in the next downturn. This is one of\nthe challenges of monetary policymaking that requires empirical analysis, historical perspective,\nand judgment.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nLow or even negative interest rates have been the policy response of central banks\ngrappling with difficulties in reaching legislated mandates in many countries. However, it is\nimportant that central banks think about attainment of their mandates not only at the current time,\nbut also through time. Policymakers must weigh the benefits of low interest rates now against\nthe potential costs in the future of possibly spurring financial instability that will ultimately have\ndownstream adverse effects on firms and households.\nIn the United States, a potential collateral impact of very low interest rates has been rapid\nprice appreciation in the commercial real estate sector. While there are certainly fundamental\nfeatures that make commercial real estate an attractive asset class, I think it is fair to say that part\nof the attraction has been the low interest rate environment. The financial stability concerns that\ncould arise from a low interest rate policy continuing for an extended period of time should be\nconsidered in conjunction with how best to achieve the dual mandate goals, now and over time.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\n“The core PCE price index is defined as personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices excluding food and\nenergy prices.

For example, three major U.S. stock indices recently set records on the same day, an event last seen in\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 3:15 P.M.in Beijing, China, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n1999.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Series\nHelsinki, Finland\nJune 6, 2016\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank our hosts, the Bank of Finland and the Global\nInterdependence Center, for inviting me to speak as part of this forum.\nIn addition to discussing the main topic of the panel, the experience in the United States\nand Europe with quantitative easing, I will provide a few comments on the current outlook for\nthe U.S. economy. The U.S. experience is an important part of the discussion, as we are in the\nprocess of gradually normalizing interest rates, and a key consideration with quantitative easing\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand nontraditional monetary policy tools more generally is the strategy for exiting when that\nbecomes appropriate.\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nIn the United States, the central bank has taken the first step toward more normalized\nmonetary conditions with the 25 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate\nin December. It is my expectation that economic conditions will continue to gradually improve,\nwhich in turn would justify further actions to normalize policy, continuing a gradual return to a\nmore normal interest rate environment.\nLately the economic data have been choppy. In the first quarter, employment growth was\nstrong but spending data showed weakness. To date in the second quarter, we have had a\nreversal of that pattern, with economic data consistent with a pick-up in growth, but weaker\nemployment growth. However, I still expect sufficient economic growth to justify a gradual\nremoval of accommodation.\nI would note that the move toward policy normalization has been much slower than in\nprevious U.S. recoveries, because of economic conditions characterized by a very gradual return\nto full employment and to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. I expect the\nnormalization process will continue to be gradual, compared with previous episodes of U.S.\ninterest rate tightening.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe most comprehensive and complete evaluation of monetary policy tools can take\nplace only after a return to more normal economic conditions and monetary policy. Still, with\nthat caveat, my overall assessment of quantitative easing is that it was quite successfully utilized\nin the United States. One reason the U.S. is now relatively close to achieving both aspects of the\nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – full employment and price stability (which the\nFederal Reserve targets at 2 percent inflation) – is the early and forceful use of quantitative\neasing in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Real rates that are relevant to households and\nfirms have been quite low, in part as a result of the accommodative monetary policy. This has\nstimulated the U.S. economy despite forceful headwinds stemming from the financial crisis and\nfrom economic struggles confronting our trading partners.\nWith regard to the use of negative interest rates, I would say the experience in Japan and\nparts of Europe seems mixed. It will take some time before one can fully assess the overall\nimpact on the Japanese and European economies. But my assessment so far of the effectiveness\nof the transmission mechanism of negative-rate policy, and of behavioral responses to negative\ninterest rates, make this a tool to use only after other nontraditional monetary policy tools – the\n“more-conventional unconventional” tools – have been exhausted.\n\nA Few Comments on the U.S. Economic Outlook\nThe minutes of the April FOMC meeting indicated the conditions that would make it\nappropriate to further raise interest rates include a rebound in spending (that is, growth from the\nfirst quarter level), continued strengthening of labor markets, and additional progress toward\nreaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.1\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 1 provides the forecasts for second quarter real GDP from two groups of private\nsector forecasters, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow “Nowcast.”2 All\nthree indicate an expectation that real GDP growth will pick up in the second quarter of this year.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s forecast similarly expects growth in the second quarter to\nbe somewhat above 2 percent.\nOne reason for the widespread optimism that the second quarter will include something\nof a “snap back” from the weak growth of the first quarter is the strong retail sales report for\nApril, as shown in Figure 2. The April increase was large, relative to sales over the past year\nand was fairly widely distributed across retail categories. Because consumption is approximately\ntwo-thirds of U.S. GDP, strong consumption provides a significant boost to the overall economy.\nIn terms of labor markets, the employment situation report for May was disappointing.\nNonfarm payroll employment grew by only 38,000 jobs; however, we should note that this\nnumber was held down by about 35,000 jobs as a result of a significant strike which has since\nended.3 In addition, the previous two months of payroll employment were revised down by\n59,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, in part due to a 0.2 percentage point\ndecline in the civilian labor force participation rate.\nGiven that the labor market contrasts with the pattern in the first quarter, and the pick-up\nin spending observed so far from other data, it will be important to see whether the weakness in\nthis report is an anomaly or reflects a broader slowing in labor markets.\nDespite the weakness in the recent employment report, at 4.7 percent unemployment we\nare now at my estimate of full employment. On Figure 3, the shaded band shows the central\ntendency4 of the forecasts of the longer-run unemployment rate that Federal Reserve presidents\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand governors submitted in the March Summary of Economic Projections (the SEP). Note that\n4.7 percent is at the bottom of the central tendency and is also the median unemployment\nprojection for year-end 2016 by Federal Reserve’s policymakers.\nIn terms of inflation, the rise in energy prices and the depreciation of the dollar relative to\nJanuary highs reverses some of the factors that had been contributing to low inflation readings in\nthe U.S. The core inflation rate, shown in Figure 4, has been 1.6 percent over the past year,\nsomewhat higher than in 2015. So, while it is only gradual progress, we are seeing some\nevidence of inflation moving toward the 2 percent inflation target.\nThe normalization process has been very gradual – appropriately so, given the very\ngradual return to full employment and to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target – but\nthis also means that a truly comprehensive evaluation of quantitative easing in the United States\nwill not be possible for some time. Still, evidence to date allows me to share my current\nassessment of the quantitative easing experience in the United States.\n\nQuantitative Easing in the United States\nI was a strong supporter of pursuing quantitative easing in the United States during the\naftermath of the financial crisis and in light of the very slow recovery. My reasoning was quite\nstraightforward. With short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound, an unemployment rate\nwell above the level associated with full employment, and inflation too low – well below the\nFederal Reserve’s target of 2 percent – I was convinced the U.S. economy needed more stimulus.\nIdeally, perhaps, more of that stimulus would have been generated by fiscal policy, but when\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfiscal stimulus was not forthcoming, monetary policymakers needed to act strongly to ensure\nattainment of our dual mandate goals.\nI would note that the U.S. central bank used other tools in addition to quantitative easing\n– most notably, forward guidance that highlighted our plan to remain accommodative for some\ntime; and earlier on, liquidity facilities designed to address some of the stresses experienced in\nfinancial markets during and after the financial crisis.\nHowever, I view quantitative easing as one of our most important monetary policy tools\nin this cycle. In the wake of the financial crisis, the recovery to normal levels of activity was\npainfully slow. Lower long-term rates and higher asset prices generally would help to spur\nactivity, but with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, monetary policy makers\nneeded another tool to affect long rates and other asset prices. Purchasing longer-term securities\npushes down the interest rates paid by households and firms,5 increasing aggregate demand in\nthe economy. I would note that in the United States, the central bank is limited to purchasing\nTreasury or agency mortgage-backed securities, while many other central banks have far more\nlatitude to purchase assets that may more directly influence the borrowing costs of households\nand firms.\nNumerous studies have examined announcement effects and found that quantitative\neasing significantly affected rates, although the studies find different impacts depending on the\nnature and circumstances of the quantitative easing.6 Today, I will not try to replicate those\nstudies by focusing on event dates, but rather will simply examine whether financial conditions\nfor households and firms were generally easier after the onset of quantitative easing, with less\nspecific focus on the various programs.7 Note that interest rates were impacted not only by the\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nquantitative easing in the United States, but also the quantitative easing implemented in Japan\nand Europe, as well as other factors such as relatively weak global economic conditions.\nFigure 5 shows the real rates on auto loans in the U.S. Prior to quantitative easing, real\nauto loan rates had generally been above 4 percent, while over the past several years (after\nquantitative easing) real auto loan rates in the United States have been below 2 percent. More\nrecently, with the increased expectation of rising short-term interest rates in the United States,\nthere has been a very modest upward trend in real auto loan rates. Consumers seem to have\nresponded to the lower real interest rates and more robust economy, as auto sales have been quite\nstrong over the past several years, returning to pre-recession highs.\nFigure 6 shows the real rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. Prior to quantitative\neasing, real mortgage rates had generally been above 4 percent, and afterward real mortgage\nrates in the United States have generally been fluctuating between 2 and 3 percent. Over the past\nseveral years, residential real estate investment has been trending up, though many borrowers\nstill find it difficult to meet the post-crisis credit standards for home mortgages.\nFigure 7 shows the real rates on corporate bonds. Prior to quantitative easing, real 10year rates for AAA and AA corporate borrowers generally fluctuated between 3 and 4 percent,\nwhile over the past several years, real rates for AAA and AA borrowers have generally varied\nbetween 1 and 2 percent.\nIn sum, households and firms have seen lower real rates since the first quantitative easing\nwas implemented in the United States. In part because of this monetary stimulus, enacted after\nthe traditional policy rate hit the zero lower bound, the U.S. economy is approaching both\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nelements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. This stimulus led, in part, to conditions\nappropriate for the initial increase in short-term rates in December 2015.\nWhile the full evaluation of quantitative easing in the United States will need to wait until\nmonetary policy has fully normalized, I expect the results will suggest that the tool was useful\nduring the crisis and therefore will be appropriate in the future, should we once again experience\na recession where short-term interest rates hit the zero lower bound.\n\nA Few Observations on Negative Interest Rates\nTurning to the issue of negative rates, let me first say that fortunately I do not expect that\nthe United States will need to use negative interest rates given that we are slowly recovering, and\non the path to more normalized monetary policy. Also, I will say that for several reasons which I\nwill discuss today, I would only turn to the tool of negative rates as a last resort. While a number\nof central banks have implemented negative interest rates, I think the Japanese experience is\nespecially informative because the announcement of negative interest rates came as a surprise to\nmany, and the results to date seem so decidedly mixed.\nUnlike quantitative easing, which reduces long-term rates and credit spreads, negative\nshort-term policy rates have their most direct effects on short-term market rates. As is the case\nwith low but positive policy rates, negative policy rates generally make holding short-term\nsecurities less attractive and, all things equal, are expected to depreciate the currency.\nInterestingly, after the announcement of negative interest rates in Japan (see Figure 8), the\nexchange rate appreciated. This decreased the costs of imports, lowering their contribution to\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\noverall inflation, and made hitting the inflation target more difficult. The real cost of mortgages\nis modestly lower following the announcement (shown in Figure 9) while the real cost of\ncorporate borrowing (in Figure 10) actually ends up rising. So the positive effects expected\nfrom the announcement are not clearly reflected in the data.\nFurthermore, the announcement of negative rates in Japan does seem to have had some\nadverse consequences. The monetary policy transmission mechanism is more effective when\nbanks are healthy and able to pass on lower interest costs on to borrowers. However, as Figure\n11 shows, Japanese bank stocks declined after the announcement of negative interest rates,\nperhaps reflecting concern, in part, that negative rates will prove challenging for the profit model\nof Japanese banks.8\nAn additional concern is that the presence of negative rates could disrupt some short-term\ncredit markets. As an example, the volume of trades in Japan’s call market decreased, and\nconcerns have been raised over a lack of market liquidity for short-term maturities (see Figure\n12).\nAt this early stage, the behavior of Japanese consumers and firms in response to negative\ninterest rates is as yet unclear. If households view negative interest rates as a tool of last resort,\nthe behavioral response of households and firms may be dominated by risk-averse behavior,\nresulting in less consumption and investment. Much more time, experience, and empirical\nobservation across countries will be needed to fully assess the impact of negative interest rates as\na monetary policy tool. However, in my view the results to date do not seem particularly\npromising. I believe that for the United States, negative rates would be a tool to be employed\nonly after most other tools had proved insufficient to stimulate the economy.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, June 6, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M.in Helsinki, Finland, OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nCentral banks around the world have tried a variety of new tools to address the severe\neconomic problems experienced since the financial crisis. My view is that the positive response\nof the U.S. economy to quantitative easing is one of the reasons we are now approaching both\nelements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\nIn contrast, I would observe that negative interest rates seem to have much more mixed\nresults. At least that is the early conclusion I would draw, based on initial reactions to the\nannouncement of negative interest rates in Japan.\nFortunately, in the United States I do not expect additional quantitative easing or negative\ninterest rates to be utilized given that we are slowly recovering, and on the path to more\nnormalized monetary policy. I expect that the U.S. central bank will gradually normalize\nmonetary policy as the three conditions set out in the April FOMC minutes are met.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nMore precisely the minutes said, “Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic\ngrowth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making\nprogress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to\nincrease the target range for the federal funds rate in June.”\n\n2\n\nSee https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx?panel=1.\n\n3\n\nThe Labor Department counts striking workers as unemployed.\n\n4\n\nThe central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPresentation to the\nGreater Concord Chamber of Commerce\nConcord, New Hampshire\nMay 12, 2016\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for inviting me to Concord, New Hampshire to\ntalk about the economy. At the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today\nare my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nIn addition to this discussion, I am also looking forward to a meeting this afternoon about\nthe Boston Federal Reserve Bank’s work on post-industrial cities1 and how that work might be\nbeneficially applied in New Hampshire.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI would also like to offer very special thanks to Richard Uchida for extending the\ninvitation to be here today. I have gotten to know Richard through our work on the Colby\nCollege Board of Trustees, and I know how dedicated he is to so many legal, civic, and\ncharitable endeavors. His public service is something I greatly admire.\nLast Friday’s employment report for April was one of the first major indicators of how\nthe economy is unfolding in the second quarter. Employers added 160,000 new jobs in April.\nWhile this was a bit below market expectations, and below the 203,000 average monthly gain for\nthe first quarter, it still reflects what I would consider to be relatively strong payroll employment\ngrowth. Given broad demographic trends, like the slowing of population growth and increased\nbaby boomer retirements, normal or “trend” payroll employment growth is now between 80,000\nand 100,000 jobs a month.2\nAs a result, if April’s payroll employment growth continues, it should be strong enough\nto bring some further tightening of labor markets. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 5 percent\nin April, we remain only somewhat above my estimate of “full” employment, which is 4.7\npercent unemployment.\nI would add that other elements of the jobs report were positive. Average hourly earnings\nincreased by 2.5 percent over the past year, and there was an increase in the workweek.\nSomewhat higher wages and hours worked will add to household income, and so should be\npositive drivers of future consumption.\nFirst-quarter GDP growth, at only 0.5 percent, was weaker than most economists\nexpected. But most private forecasters do not expect such weakness to persist. And after\nconcerns about foreign growth at the turn of the year impacted U.S. and foreign stock markets\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthrough mid-February of this year, markets have since rebounded, both here and abroad. In\naddition, the dollar has recently depreciated on a trade-weighted basis, and the economic\nindicators for many of our trading partners have come in stronger than expected. For example,\ngrowth in the Euro area in the first quarter was actually faster than in the United States. These\ndevelopments bode well for export-dependent U.S. industries. Furthermore, domestic demand is\nstarting to rebound as auto sales, which had dipped a bit in March, have returned to their mid2015 levels.\nAll this suggests that, with diminished headwinds from abroad and consumers responding\nto growing household income and wealth, consumer spending should improve over the course of\nthe second quarter. Of course at this point, this is still a forecast, as we currently have very little\nby way of actual spending data for this quarter.\nHowever, the limited second-quarter data to date are consistent with my expectation that\ngrowth in real GDP in the second quarter will be somewhat above my estimate of the so-called\n“potential” growth rate for the economy – about 1.75 percent in my analysis. The early data are\nalso consistent with some continued gradual improvement in labor markets and with inflation\nmoving gradually closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for inflation.\nIf the economic data that come in over the course of this quarter confirm these trends, it\nwill be appropriate to continue the gradual normalization of monetary policy that began with the\ninitial increase in short-term interest rates last December. In my view, the market remains too\npessimistic about the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of removing\nmonetary accommodation is higher than is currently priced into financial markets based on\ncurrent data.\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nExploring Recent Economic Data\nAllow me to walk you through some of the analysis that underpins my views and\nexpectations.\nFigure 1 provides the quarterly pattern of real GDP over the past two years. The firstquarter data are shown in red. As I mentioned a moment ago, first-quarter real GDP for this year\nwas a disappointing 0.5 percent. Since 2014, first-quarter real GDP growth has tended to be\ndisappointing, but over the last two years it has provided a poor signal of subsequent quarters,\nwhich experienced stronger growth. This pattern may partly reflect weather anomalies, or it may\nsuggest imperfect adjustments for changing seasonal patterns in the data. Still, it will be\nimportant to obtain more data on spending to determine whether it is likely that the economy will\ngrow above potential.\nAn important area of weakness in first-quarter real GDP was consumption, which\naccounts for approximately two-thirds of real GDP. Consumption grew 1.9 percent at an\nannualized rate in the quarter. This moderate pace is somewhat surprising, given the progress in\nthe usual supports for consumer spending during the quarter. By the end of the quarter, stock\nprices had recovered, and housing prices rose, as did personal income, driven in part by gains in\npayroll employment. Most forecasters expect these relatively strong fundamentals to spur\nconsumption, a key driver for most of their forecasts. Without strong consumption, most\nforecasts look decidedly weaker.\nWhile we have relatively scant data so far on second-quarter activity, Figure 2 provides\nsome reassuring data for auto sales – which are released with a very short time lag. The last two\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmonths of data are shown in red. Fortunately, the sizable decline in March did not persist, as\nauto sales rebounded, although they are still below levels seen earlier this year.\nThe most important second-quarter data point we have in hand is last Friday’s\nemployment report, which indicated that April payroll employment grew by 160,000 jobs, as\nshown in Figure 3. While roughly the same as the growth in January, this was below the\naverage monthly increase in the first quarter. However, these data still reflect relatively robust\nemployment growth at a time when the U.S. economy is close to what most economists consider\nfull employment.\nIn fact, as we approach full employment, we expect employment growth to moderate\ntoward its long-run sustainable growth rate – a rate that will neither raise nor lower the\nunemployment rate. Federal Reserve economists currently estimate that rate, based on\ndemographic and population data, to be about 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month. So, while the\nApril jobs growth was below market expectations, it remained strong enough to continue the\ngradual improvement in labor markets.\nFurthermore, other data in the employment report were even more positive. While the\nofficial, widely reported U-3 measure of the unemployment rate remained the same as in March,\nat 5 percent, the broader U-6 rate (which includes the unemployed, as well as people “marginally\nattached” to the labor force, and people employed part time for economic reasons3) declined\nsomewhat further to 9.7 percent.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the U-6 unemployment rate was over 12 percent at the beginning\nof 2014. The decline that has taken place since then reflects continued reductions in the number\nof workers employed only part time for economic reasons, and also the trend of more so-called\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndiscouraged workers finding work over the past two years. The spread between U-6 and U-3 is\none of the major reasons for tightening monetary policy only gradually even though we are\nrelatively close to full employment, with more workers being drawn into full-time employment\nas labor markets improve.\nAnother positive effect of further gradual tightening of labor markets is that over time,\ntighter labor markets should lead to higher wages and salaries. Figure 5 provides some evidence\nthat we are beginning to see a tentative upward trend in average hourly earnings. Over the past\nyear, average hourly earnings have risen about 2.5 percent, which represents a gradual increase\nfrom the 2 percent pace we had seen in earlier years.\nFigure 6 shows there has also been a somewhat positive trend in the rate of inflation,\nwhich had been extremely subdued. Over the past year, inflation – measured by the Core\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or Core PCE – has averaged 1.6 percent. This\nis somewhat higher than the 1.3 to 1.4 percent that we were averaging throughout 2015. While\nstill below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve as an optimum level of annual\ninflation, the most recent data hint at a gradual move toward that target – a trend that was not\nevident last year.\nSo, while it is still early in the quarter, it appears that the economy is continuing to\ngradually improve. We are adding jobs faster than trend, broader measures of unemployment\nhave continued to tighten, and there has been a welcome upward trend in both wages and prices.\nAnd while we have limited spending data for the quarter, the data we do have seem consistent\nwith growth above potential.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRisks Associated with Leaving Rates Too Low for Too Long\nI believe that one of the benefits of our current accommodative monetary policy, even as\nwe approach full employment, is that it fosters continued gradual improvement in labor markets.\nAs I have noted in the past, it is quite appropriate to probe on the natural rate of unemployment\nto see how low it might be, given the benefit to workers. We have seen workers rejoin the labor\nforce, many of them previously having given up looking for work.\nHowever, there can be potential costs to accommodation if rates stay too low for too\nlong. One cost involves the potential of very low interest rates encouraging speculative\nbehavior. One area where I have some concern in this regard is the commercial real estate\nmarket. Let me walk you through some of the numbers that I find illuminating.\nFigure 7 shows commercial real estate prices for four broad property types. As labor\nmarkets have improved and vacancy rates have declined, it is not surprising that there has been\nsome appreciation in commercial real estate prices. For apartments, prices have increased – as\nmany potential homebuyers have chosen to rent rather than own, presumably chastened by the\nexperiences of many homeowners during the financial crisis, or constrained by stricter\nrequirements for down-payments and other mortgage qualifications. However, prices now\nexceed the peaks reached prior to the financial crisis, and are well above the levels reached in\n2005 as real estate prices were beginning to accelerate before the financial crisis.4\nWhile Figure 7 reflects national commercial real estate prices, regional indices show that\nprices have been rising particularly quickly on both coasts. Certainly in Boston, one of the\nrelatively hot commercial real estate markets, the higher prices for commercial real estate are\nreadily apparent.\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 shows real multifamily residential mortgage growth from 1976 to 2015. Growth\nin mortgage debt on multifamily properties is up sharply from lows reached in this cycle in 2010.\nIn the most recent quarter, multifamily mortgage growth was just shy of the pre-recession peak.\nWe care about potentially inflated commercial real estate prices because they might risk a\nbout of financial instability. History shows that most periods of serious financial instability\ninvolve a scenario in which debt is high relative to a volatile underlying asset, and the value of\nthe asset subsequently declines. These declines not only create problems for the owners of the\nasset (in this case, property), but also for the lenders – who may end up acquiring the asset in the\nevent of default. Often these lenders are highly levered institutions.\nIn fact, this exact scenario played out in New England in the late 1980s and early 1990s,\nresulting in slumping real estate prices, failing financial institutions, and broader problems of\ncredit availability for borrowers (both individuals and firms) that were dependent on financial\ninstitutions for loans. Given that history, it is important that we take actions early enough to\navoid a repetition of that experience.\nPotential concerns surrounding commercial real estate led to a recent Interagency\nStatement on Prudential Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending (SR 15-17)5\nthat, along with the 2006 Interagency Guidance on Concentrations of Commercial Real Estate\nLending (SR 07-1),6 emphasized the need for exposure thresholds, increased monitoring, and\nprudent risk-management practices. While this guidance applies to regulated banks, it is notable\nthat commercial real estate loans are also being provided by non-bank lenders (and foreign\ninvestors).\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, one potential cost to keeping rates too low for too long is that doing so might\nencourage excessive risk-taking in commercial real estate – a sector likely to be influenced by\nlow borrowing costs.\nA second possible cost of keeping rates too low for too long relates to the limits we see in\nmonetary policy’s ability to “fine tune” the economy. Consider Figure 9. Once unemployment\nhas reached its low point in the economic cycle, it is unusual for it to proceed smoothly back to\nthe natural rate. The red highlighting indicates the first time that the unemployment rate rises by\n0.4 percentage points after hitting a cyclical low. There are no episodes in which unemployment\nrose a bit and remained stable at its natural employment rate. Instead, relatively soon after the\nperiods shown here with red highlighting, unemployment rises significantly – that is, we\nexperience a recession, as indicated by the gray shading.\nThe chart strongly suggests that it has proven difficult to calibrate policy so as to\ngradually increase the unemployment rate, gently nudging it back toward full employment. The\nlesson is that policymakers should avoid significantly overshooting their best estimates of the\nnatural rate of unemployment.\nToday, the unemployment rate is still somewhat above my estimate of the natural rate,\n4.7 percent. But waiting too long to have more normalized rates risks possibly overshooting on\nthe unemployment rate, and needing to tighten more quickly than would be desirable.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that the economy has continued to improve\ngradually. While it has been a slow, methodical recovery from the Great Recession, it is\nimportant to recognize that we are approaching full employment, and getting closer to the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent target for inflation. The real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate\nremains quite stimulative, which is unusual for an economy that is near both of the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate goals (stable prices, which we target as 2 percent inflation, and\nmaximum sustainable employment).\nIf the incoming economic data continue to be consistent with gradual improvement in\nlabor markets and inflation getting closer to target, the Fed should be ready to gradually\nnormalize interest rates, perhaps at a pace not currently anticipated by the federal funds futures\nmarket, as I have noted in other talks.7\nOf course, there is always the potential for disruptions from abroad or at home that could\nimpact the U.S. economy. However, such concerns are only pertinent if they materially change\nthe outlook for the U.S. economy.\nAll in all, should incoming economic data confirm that we continue to make progress on\nboth inflation and labor markets, I believe the Federal Reserve should continue with the gradual\nremoval of monetary policy accommodation.\nThank you.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 12, 2016 at 12:20 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAmerican Savings Foundation Distinguished\nLecture at Central Connecticut State University\nNew Britain, Connecticut\nApril 18, 2016\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Are Financial Markets Too Pessimistic\nAbout the Economy?”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAmerican Savings Foundation Distinguished Lecture at\nCentral Connecticut State University\nNew Britain, Connecticut\nApril 18, 2016\n\nGood evening. It is a pleasure to be joining you for the American Savings Foundation\nDistinguished Lecture at Central Connecticut State University.\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nIncoming economic data for the first quarter suggest that growth in the quarter was\ndisappointing, with real GDP likely to have advanced at a pace well below most estimates of\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npotential growth, about 2 percent. However, I will point out that weakness in the first quarter has\nbeen a consistent pattern in recent years, and to date, that weakness has generally been offset in\nsubsequent quarters, as the economy has continued to improve slowly. Certainly the March\nunemployment report showing 215,000 jobs created, along with an increase in the labor force\nparticipation rate to 63 percent, is supportive of a more optimistic reading of the GDP numbers.\nAdditionally, the core PCE inflation rate is now at 1.7 percent, much closer to the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target than were the core PCE readings in 2015.\nDespite this gradual improvement in the U.S. economy, global financial markets have\nbeen quite turbulent. Concerns that low inflation and weak growth abroad might spill over into\nthe U.S. have had an impact, it appears, and prices in financial futures markets now suggest that\nmarket participants expect considerably fewer interest rate increases in the United States than\nhistorically occur when the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates. Federal funds futures currently\nreflect the expectation of approximately one-quarter of a percentage point increase in each of the\nnext three years.\nWhile I believe that gradual federal funds rate increases are absolutely appropriate, I do\nnot see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the\nexceptionally shallow interest rate path currently reflected in financial futures markets. The\nforecast for economic variables contained in the most recent Fed policymakers’ Summary of\nEconomic Projections is consistent with my own estimate – GDP growth slightly above potential\nand a continued slow decline in the unemployment rate.\nFurthermore, I would point out that the extremely shallow rate path reflected in the\nmarket for federal funds futures seems at odds with forecasts by private sector economists and by\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfinancial firms that serve as counterparties to the Federal Reserve (the so-called primary dealers),\nas well as my own forecast for the U.S. economy. Most of these forecasts envision a much\nhealthier U.S. economy than is implied by that unusually shallow path of the funds rate, and\nmany of the major private forecasters expect short-term rates to rise more rapidly than implied\nby financial futures.\nThe unemployment rate is currently 5 percent, and I expect it to continue to drift down.\nAs I have noted publicly in the past, it is quite appropriate to probe how low unemployment can\ngo, given that the inflation rate is below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and wages are\nonly increasing modestly.\nProbing just how low the unemployment rate can fall before risking overheating in the\neconomy can be beneficial for labor markets. It should encourage those who have left the labor\nmarket to re-enter, a welcome trend we have seen recently. Such probing is particularly helpful\nto those who became discouraged by the very weak labor market during and following the Great\nRecession, and thus stopped looking for work – as well as those who continue to be part-time\nworkers who would prefer full-time work. In the parlance of labor economists, I suspect that the\namount of so called labor market “slack” is greater than what is captured by the traditional and\nwidely reported U-3 measure of the unemployment rate, and we should welcome any remaining\nslack being absorbed by a healthy labor market.\nHowever, the unemployment rate is now at 5 percent – relatively close to my estimate of\nfull employment, 4.7 percent – and net payroll employment growth is averaging over 200,000\njobs per month over the past quarter. My concern is that given these conditions, an interest rate\npath at the pace embedded in the futures markets could risk an unemployment rate that falls well\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbelow the natural rate of unemployment. We are currently at an unemployment rate where such\na large, rapid decline in unemployment could be risky, as an overheating economy would\neventually produce inflation rising above our 2 percent goal, eventually necessitating a rapid\nremoval of monetary policy accommodation. I would prefer that the Federal Reserve not risk\nmaking the mistake of significantly overshooting the full employment level, resulting in the need\nto rapidly raise interest rates – with potentially disruptive effects and an increased risk of a\nrecession.\nIn sum, in my view the very shallow path of rate increases implied by financial futures\nmarket pricing would likely result in an overheating that necessitates the Fed eventually raising\ninterest rates more quickly than is desirable, which could endanger the ongoing recovery and\ncontinued growth.\n\nFinancial Futures and the Expected Path for Interest Rates\n\nFigure 1 provides the path of the federal funds rate in the rate-tightening cycles\nfollowing the last two recessions. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a\npercentage point at each FOMC meeting in the two years following the first increase in 2004.\nThe pace of increases was even quicker when the FOMC began to raise rates in 1994. In\ncontrast, as noted in my introduction, the federal funds futures market is currently reflecting the\nexpectation of a much more gradual pace of tightening this time around. The market is currently\nassuming only a roughly one-quarter percentage point increase per year rather than per FOMC\nmeeting as in the 2004 episode, over the next three years – an exceptionally shallow rate path.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe federal funds futures are not the only anomaly that I see in financial markets. In\nFigure 2, we see that the rate on 10 year Treasury securities is currently below 2 percent. If one\nbelieves that the Federal Reserve will be successful in averaging 2 percent inflation over the next\n10 years, then investors in these benchmark securities are accepting a negative real rate of return\nover the 10 year period.\nThe pricing on both short- and long-term securities seems most consistent with either a\nfairly pessimistic best guess for the economy’s prospects in the near future, or with concern\nabout an unusually large “tail” risk (that is, a significant chance that the economy could be much\nweaker than expected). Both scenarios would affect the path of federal funds rate futures prices.\nWith that in mind, I will turn now to private-sector forecasts for the economy, to see if\neconomists or financial forecasters are predicting either an unusually weak economy or very\nsignificant tail risk over the next several years.\n\nPrivate-Sector Forecasts of the Economy\nFocusing first on the likely economic outlook, I would note that private-sector forecasts\ndo not seem particularly pessimistic. Figure 3 shows the most recent Blue Chip forecast for real\nGDP, which aggregates the results of roughly 50 private sector economic forecasts. Most of\nthese private sector forecasters are expecting a weak first quarter, but are not expecting that\nweakness to persist.\nConsistent with GDP growth that is expected to be somewhat above 2 percent, Figure 4\nshows that the Blue Chip forecasters expect a gradual decrease in the unemployment rate. The\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nconsensus is that the unemployment rate will level off at 4.5 percent, a little below my estimate\nof full employment.\nThe Blue Chip forecast extends only through 2017. An alternative survey is conducted\nwith the primary dealers, the financial firms that serve as counterparties to the Federal Reserve\nwhen we buy or sell government securities as part of our monetary policy responsibilities. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York surveys the primary dealers on a regular basis regarding the\neconomic outlook and their forecasts. Figure 5 shows the primary dealers’ forecast for the\nunemployment rate through 2018. Like the Blue Chip forecast, the primary dealers see the\nunemployment rate drifting down to 4.5 percent by 2017, but then have it returning to 4.7\npercent by the fourth quarter of 2018. One interpretation of this path would be that it predicts the\nunemployment rate modestly overshooting full employment but then stabilizing at full\nemployment as the Federal Reserve takes steps to gradually normalize interest rates.\nSo the evidence suggests that economic forecasters and primary dealers do not seem to\nexpect a particularly weak economy. But, it is possible that while they view the most likely\noutcome as benign, they fear an elevated risk of a much more worrisome outcome. If true, such\na pricing-in of tail risk probability could potentially justify a low federal funds rate and 10-year\nTreasury rate, even with a favorable expected economic outlook.1\nOne way of ascertaining the perceived potential for a heightened possibility of a tail risk\nevent is to look at surveys that try to capture forecasters’ assessments of risks around the\nforecast. The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) incorporates the outlook of private sector\neconomists and provides the distribution of outcomes around their forecasts, as well as the most\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlikely outcome in their forecast. A significant tail risk event would likely be reflected in a higher\nprobability of an elevated unemployment rate, which would be more consistent with a recession.\nTo that end, Figure 6 examines the average probability among SPF forecasters that the\nannual average unemployment rate will be 6 percent or higher in either 2016 or 2017. A 6\npercent unemployment rate is a full percentage point above the current unemployment rate of 5\npercent, and would be consistent with a relatively mild recession. But rather than being\nelevated, the probability of such an outcome has fallen quite significantly over time – in the\nsurveys taken in 2014, 2015, and 2016. While some of this multi-year trend reflects the drifting\ndown of the realized unemployment rate, the probability has continued to fall over the past\nseveral quarters, while the unemployment rate has been relatively stable near the current rate.\nFigure 7 provides the entire distribution of the predictions for the unemployment rate in\n2016 according to the two most recent forecasts by the SPF. While the average probability or\nassessed likelihood of the unemployment rate being at recession levels is relatively low, the\nsurveys show an increased probability of the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent, a rate\nmost forecasters would judge to be well below estimates of full employment. Figure 8 shows\nthat for 2017, the probability that the unemployment rate will fall below 4 percent actually rises\nto just over 10 percent.\nFigure 9 highlights one reason why it might be risky if the unemployment rate were to\nfall well below the estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. The green line provides the\nCongressional Budget Office’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. As the figure\nshows, prior to the last three recessions, the unemployment rate fell well below the green line.\nAt times like that, the economy has exceeded its sustainable level of activity, and monetary\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npolicy often needs to react to try to modestly slow the economy. Unfortunately, modestly\nslowing down the economy is difficult, and as the chart shows, during these previous episodes\nthe unemployment rate subsequently rose significantly above the natural rate of unemployment.\nRecently, the unemployment rate has been fluctuating around 5 percent. In part, this\nreflects positive news on labor force participation. Unemployment has remained stable in the\nface of strong growth because many of the new jobs have gone to workers re-entering the labor\nforce. As Figure 10 shows, for the preceding five years, the unemployment rate has been\ndrifting down along with the labor force participation rate.\nOne reason for the decline in labor force participation involves changes in the\ndemographics of the labor market. As the percentage of the population (notably baby boomers)\nreaching retirement age rose, labor force participation was expected to decline. However, at\nleast some of the decline in labor force participation has reflected the poor job prospects of\nworkers who have become discouraged or have not looked for work over the past year given the\njobs that are available to them. As the labor market has become tighter, some individuals have\nreturned to the labor force, as we had long expected.2\nOne reason for probing how low the unemployment rate can go is that it will encourage\nmore people to return to the labor force. Particularly for those workers who may need additional\ntraining, there are benefits to the individuals and to the economy of having a higher percentage\nof the population working. However, these advantages need to be weighed against the risk that\nsignificantly more people might not actually be drawn into the labor force, and in that case with\ncontinued employment growth, the unemployment rate would fall well below the natural rate.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAt the Boston Federal Reserve Bank we have been expecting only a slow decline in the\nunemployment rate, a forecast in part predicated on people being drawn into the labor force.\nHowever, given the difficulty in accurately estimating labor force participation, our model has\nassumed that real GDP growth somewhat over 2 percent will be consistent with some gradual\nfurther decline in the unemployment rate. In part it is gradual because of increased labor force\nparticipation, but also in part as a result of a gradual normalization of interest rates, which we\nalso assume.\nFigure 11 shows that in addition to the financial market prices, the Survey of Primary\nDealers reports a rising probability of seeing no federal funds rate increase this year. As of the\nMarch 21 update, the survey indicated somewhat more than a 20 percent probability of no\nchange this year. Even more striking is that the federal funds futures market does not price a 25\nbasis point increase in the federal funds rate with near-certainty until 2017. In my view, such\ndour interest rate projections do not seem consistent with the outlook for the economy that I and\nmany others share.\n\nConcluding Observations\nHigh frequency real economic data are indicating that the real economy likely grew less\nthan its estimated potential growth rate in the first quarter of this year. Nonetheless, most private\nforecasters – and my own forecast – expect the economy to continue to improve over the next\nseveral quarters. In addition, while there have been significant headwinds from abroad, and\nmarket turbulence related to those headwinds, I view the U.S. economy as fundamentally sound\nand likely to perform better than the domestic economies of most trading partners.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 18, 2016 at 7:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn my view, this represents an outlook strong enough to engender further decline in the\nunemployment rate, even with some gradual normalization of interest rates. As I see it, the\npricing in the federal funds futures market, which implies roughly three-quarters of a percentage\npoint in increases by the end of 2018, is inconsistent with the assessment – mine and that of\nmany forecasters – of continued moderate growth in the U.S. economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to be with you today at Central Connecticut State\nUniversity.\n\n1\n\nAnother explanation is that the level of r* – the equilibrium real interest rate – is deemed to be extremely low by\nparticipants in the federal funds future markets. Historically, r* has been around 2.5%, which is consistent with\ninflation of 2% and a nominal interest rate of 4.5%. Even with an r* of 0, the current fed funds rate implies a\nsignificant amount of policy accommodation at this stage in the business cycle. As economic headwinds fade over\ntime, r* should increase gradually and be around 1.25% to 1.5% in 2018. The 75 basis points through 2018 in the\nfutures markets would require a value for r* well into negative territory over the forecast horizon. Most estimates,\ninstead, already place the current value of r*at or slightly above zero.\n\n2\n\nSince September of 2015, we have seen an increase in labor force participation – with a significant flow of people\nfrom outside of the labor force becoming employed. While it is difficult to predict with certainty how many people\nare likely to return to the labor force as the economy improves, this is certainly a positive sign.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n2016 Cybersecurity Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 4, 2016\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Perspectives on Risks – Both Economic and Cyber”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n2016 Cybersecurity Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 4, 2016\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be able to welcome so many representatives of\nfinancial institutions to the Federal Reserve today, for what is an important program. An\nimportant role for leaders of financial institutions and their boards, of course, is monitoring and\nmitigating potential risks to their institution. Today I would like to briefly discuss, and offer my\nown views on, two areas of risk that I often hear about when I talk with bankers.\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe first area of risk that I will comment on involves the economy. Early this year,\nconcerns reemerged about the economic health of China and Europe, which led to significant\nvolatility in both foreign and domestic financial markets. In reaction to that volatility, federal\nfunds rate futures fell significantly, reflecting market expectations for only a very gradual\nincrease in short-term interest rates.\nTo preview my main point, my own sense is that financial markets may have reacted too\nstrongly. My assessment is that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve despite the\nheadwinds from abroad. If my forecast is right, it may imply more increases in short-term\ninterest rates than are currently priced into futures markets – but, let me emphasize that my\noutlook still calls for a gradual pace of increases and, as always, the path should depend on\nincoming economic data.\nThe second risk that I am going to touch on today is cyber risk, the primary focus of this\ngathering.1 It is a risk that institutions of all sizes are well aware of, and have been taking\nsignificant steps to mitigate. However, the ever-changing nature of the risk is why continued\nattention is so important. This is the topic that the speakers today are going to cover in some\ndetail, I am pleased to say.\nFor context, the risk of bank robbery or fraud had, in the past, been primarily a localized\nproblem, with relatively few individuals able to pose a significant threat. With appropriate\ncontrols, the risks of large losses were quite low. However, with banking increasingly done via\nthe internet and mobile devices, an attack can be conducted from anywhere in the world. Cyber\ncriminals are looking for the targets of opportunity without regard to geographic location, and\nthe existence of a global population of potential attackers looking for softer targets means\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nincreased risks. Without appropriate controls and defenses, the banking system could be at\ngreater risk of a large loss – but fortunately, institutions of all sizes have been expending\nsignificant resources very strategically in this area,2 and bank supervisory examiners have been\nverifying that controls are in place.\nNonetheless, as with the threat of terrorism – which has been so recently and tragically\nhighlighted – cyber defense is an area where continued vigilance and continuous improvement\nare required. This has been a focus at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, and the discussions\ntoday will touch on programs we are pursuing to support financial institutions as they continue to\nmitigate this risk.\n\nEconomic risks\nTurning back to the economy, I would note that at the beginning of the year, problems in\nthe domestic economies of many of the United States’ major trading partners began receiving\nsignificant attention. Several foreign central banks eased their monetary policy, and some\nfinancial markets became volatile. These global developments had an impact on U.S. financial\nmarkets, and many market participants began anticipating that U.S. monetary policy would be\nless likely to continue normalizing.\nIndeed, as of the end of last week, as shown in Figure 1, the federal funds futures market\nimplied the belief that there would be roughly one more quarter-point increase by the end of\n2016, and an additional quarter-point increase by the end of 2017. This extremely gradual path\nfor reducing monetary policy accommodation would imply either a weak outlook for the\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neconomy or significant concerns that even if the expected outlook was benign, there were\nsignificant “tail” risks. My own view is that the outlook is not as weak, and the tail risks not as\nelevated, as would be implied by this very gradual path.3,4\nFigure 2 shows that futures markets attach a 41 percent probability to just one increase by\nthe end of the year, and a 38 percent probability to no change at all this year. In other words, the\nfutures markets assign a very high probability of one or zero increases in rates by the end of this\nyear.\nIt is important to remember that these market probabilities can change significantly, and\nrapidly. When weaker economic data are released, the probability of tightening built into futures\nmarkets falls; conversely, when stronger data are released, the probability of tightening is seen as\nincreasing. Figure 3 shows that over the past two months, the probabilities have shifted\nsignificantly. The probability assigned to seeing no change in the federal funds rate this year\nwas less than 30 percent two months ago, rose to over 50 percent one month ago, and most\nrecently has returned to 38 percent.\nOne reason for these changing probabilities has been the weak economic data,\nparticularly from abroad. Figure 4 shows that European and Japanese stock markets weakened\nsignificantly in the middle of February, and still remained well below their levels in the middle\nof December. Figure 5 shows that the declines in U.S. stock markets were more modest, and\nhave now rebounded to levels prevailing in mid-December of last year.\nNot only have the levels of stock indices improved, but so has volatility – as shown in\nFigure 6. The VIX – a measure of stock market volatility – rose significantly in February and\nthen fell thereafter. Currently the VIX is somewhat below the level of mid-December.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe exchange rate has also been volatile, as seen in Figure 7. The dollar was stronger on\na trade-weighted basis earlier in the year. However, currently the trade-weighted data are below\nthe level of mid-December. This is similar to the pattern of bond spreads in Figure 8. While the\nspread was elevated in February, it is now below the levels seen in the middle of December.\nWith financial market volatility subsiding since earlier this year, it is to me surprising that\nthe expected path of monetary policy embedded in futures markets is so low. A weak forecast\ndoesn’t seem to explain the path expected for the funds rate (see Figures, 9, 10, and 11 for\ncontext).5 As I see it, the risks seem to be abating that problems from abroad would be severe\nenough to disrupt the U.S. recovery. Financial-market volatility has fallen, and most economic\nforecasts do not reflect expected large spillovers from continued headwinds from abroad.\nSo, while problems could still arise, I would expect that the very slow removal of\naccommodation reflected in futures market pricing could prove too pessimistic. While it has\nbeen appropriate to pause while waiting for information that clarified the response of the U.S.\neconomy to foreign turmoil, it increasingly appears that the U.S. has weathered foreign shocks\nquite well. As a consequence, if the incoming data continue to show a moderate recovery – as I\nexpect they will – I believe it will likely be appropriate to resume the path of gradual tightening\nsooner than is implied by financial-market futures.\n\nCyber risk\nTurning to the second risk I will address today, I would say that while economic risks\nhave arguably abated somewhat, the same cannot be said for cyber risk. News stories on cyber\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nattacks and cyber fraud have become more prevalent. No CEO, in any industry, can feel\ncomfortable with the barrage of stories related to cyber intrusions.\nThe ability to conduct financial transactions over the Internet and through mobile devices\nhas resulted in major innovations in financial services. Banks and other financial institutions\nhave invested heavily in technology, and in keeping that technology safe.\nOf course, it is notable that banks’ business lines are also increasingly challenged by new\norganizations that are primarily electronic. To the extent that so-called “fintech” entities\ncompete directly with banks with similar products, they are not burdened by large brick and\nmortar operations or the regulatory oversight that comes with being a bank. It is important to\nexamine whether these new innovators have fully captured the risks of economic downturns and\nthe implications for their lending model. Whether or not customers fully appreciate that depositlike accounts do not carry deposit insurance, remains to be seen.\nCustomers are looking for convenience; so not surprisingly, new applications and devices\ncontinue to evolve in new and unexpected ways. However, this rapid evolution generates risks.\nA proliferation of apps increasingly focused on customer convenience may not always focus as\nintensely on security. In addition, the consumer, rather than the financial institution, can often be\nthe entry point that cyber criminals seek to exploit.\nI mention fintech because clearly banks must continue to evolve with and invest in these\nfinancial services innovations, and therefore should be attuned to the cyber risks that come with\nonline and mobile delivery.6 The cyber criminal can be anywhere there are computer links.\nThey may very well be hard to find, submerged in the large volume of transactions and data\nhandled by financial institutions. But they also have the potential to launch massive attacks,\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nquickly ballooning from complete anonymity to a large-scale threat. These challenges make it\nimportant that CEOs, management, and boards of directors understand the risks that are posed.\nIdeally, cyber thefts can be significantly mitigated. Maintaining good cyber security and\nkeeping personnel and software up to date is critical. However, it is important to be able to\nquickly understand what is happening to other organizations and even across industries. As you\nwill hear later today, the Boston Fed tries to be quite active in this regard, to make sure that news\nof threats gleaned by the central bank or other financial institutions quickly becomes known, and\nthat appropriate actions are taken.\nI would also highlight the importance of having protocols ready, should a breach occur.\nResiliency is important, as is recovering critical operations in a timely fashion. Finally, having a\ncommunication plan to address concerns of customers, vendors, and regulators – with a clear\nunderstanding of where decision rights are held – can mitigate problems in the event of a breach.\nOf course, bank regulators and supervisors from the Fed and other agencies are attuned to\ncyber risks, and work with financial institutions on an ongoing basis to ensure defenses are\nrobust and opportunities for the spread of problems are constrained. Cyber risks make it\nimperative that we all work together to ensure that resiliency, monitoring, detection, and\nrecovery capabilities are operational in the financial system.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would observe that some of the economic concerns from\nearlier this year seem to be receding. As the economic risks abate, financial market expectations\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL April 4, 2016 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof a very slow removal of monetary policy accommodation could, it seems to me, prove unduly\npessimistic. I personally expect that a stronger economy, at essentially full employment and with\ngradually rising inflation, will lead to more tightening than is currently priced into the futures\nmarket expectations for the next two years.\nThe risks in the cyber realm are, unfortunately, not abating. Banking organizations need\nto continue to evolve as these risks morph, and as new innovations and expectations of\nconvenience introduce new challenges to security. I hope the discussion over the course of today\nwill help prepare you for those challenges.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nFor additional perspective on cybersecurity as a financial stability issue, see January 2015 remarks by Eric S.\nRosengren at: http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2015/013015/013015text.pdf\n\n2\n\nOf course, cyber risk also encompasses third-party service providers to financial institutions, so there is a need for\nvigilance in managing these relationships and entry points.\n\n3\n\nNote that the Federal Reserve Board of Governor’s Advance release of table 1 of the Summary of Economic\nProjections has a steeper path particularly in 2017. However, this reflects modal forecasts and may not capture the\ntail risks that may be priced into the futures market. See the table at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm\n4\n\nThe higher SEP forecasts were revised down about one-half percentage point from the December forecasts, as\nCommittee members responded to international developments and the implications for the U.S. economy. However,\neven after this adjustment, the path is steeper than captured in the federal funds futures rates.\n5\n\nAs previously suggested, one possible explanation could be a very weak private sector forecast for the economy.\nHowever, the policymaker forecasts in the March SEP expect a declining unemployment rate, a rising core inflation\nrate, and a real GDP forecast quite similar to the current economic forecasts from most of the private sector\nforecasters – and not much different than we have experienced over this economic recovery. So, a weak forecast\ndoesn’t seem to explain the low path expected for the funds rate. The path could suggest that the market is weighing\nthe risks from abroad more heavily than I am.\n6\n\nObviously, the traditional model of knowing customers at the branch provides little protection when business takes\nplace over network connected devices.\n\n8\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s\nConference: “Supervising Large, Complex Financial\nInstitutions: Defining Objectives and Measuring\nEffectiveness”\nNew York, New York\nMarch 18, 2016\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to have been invited to participate in this panel discussion\non defining the objectives and goals of supervision. I want to compliment the New York\nReserve Bank for convening this important conference on supervising large, complex financial\ninstitutions.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nThe discussion today of large-bank supervision is particularly germane, as we continue to\nanalyze and learn from the last financial crisis, where problems at large financial institutions had\nan important impact on the severity and duration of the recession that followed.\nIt is also important that we have an international perspective on prudential regulation on\nthis panel, provided by Andrew Bailey of the Bank of England. Large-bank problems were\nmajor contributors to the crisis globally. Actions taken during and in response to periods of bank\nstress in banking crises have varied across the world. This reflects, in part, differing attitudes\nabout what represents the greatest risk posed by large banks and their potential problems.\n\nPerspective on the Goals of Bank Supervision\nIn the United States, the most significant change to bank supervision in the past decade\nwas the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act. The preamble of the Act makes it quite clear that a\ncentral focus of the legislation was preventing the need for any future taxpayer bailouts of\ninstitutions whose demise could worsen a crisis.1 The legislation, as well as the set of\nregulations that implement it, strongly emphasize avoiding taxpayer bailouts by increasing lossabsorbing capital, and liquidity, through regulation – all to reduce the probability of a large bank\nfailure. 2 The legislation also emphasizes reducing the losses that would be borne by taxpayers in\nthe event of an institution’s default.3,4\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, bailout risk to the taxpayers – while critical – is not the only risk that motivates\ncareful regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries. The broader goal for supervision\nand regulation reflects the highest intention of all economic policy making: simply to maximize\nthe well-being of the public. Bank failures – and financial instability in general – reduce the\npublic welfare, because well-functioning financial intermediaries are essentially the lubricant for\nthe real economy. A car engine without oil will seize up; similarly, countries with failed\nfinancial intermediaries can find their economies seizing up. It is no coincidence that the two\nworst economic cycles in the U.S. over the past one hundred years have coincided with the\nwidespread failure of financial institutions.\nThe Great Depression and the Great Recession, of course, brought large losses to many\nfinancial intermediaries. But the largest costs were associated with lost employment, production,\nand wealth. Both the Dodd-Frank legislation and recent supervisory letters emphasize making\nfinancial institutions resilient, maintaining financial stability, and preventing problems at\nfinancial intermediaries from damaging the real economy.5 So a central focus of regulation and\nsupervision should be to help improve public welfare by maintaining the efficient and effective\nconduct of intermediary services despite economic cycles.\nFinancial intermediaries play a critical role in efficiently channeling funds from savers to\nborrowers, whose investment in a business idea or household propels the real economy.\nFinancial intermediaries are also the major conduit through which monetary policy affects the\nreal economy, making them key to transmitting policies that foster economic recoveries.6,7\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nSupervision aims to ensure that financial institutions are resilient to even severe shocks.\nWith sufficiently high capital regulation and effective use of stress tests, supervision should help\nprevent systemic failures. Stress testing – a proactive supervisory approach introduced after the\ncrisis – should, if properly implemented, make systematic failures quite unlikely. In fact, stress\ntests should lead to restrictions on dividends or share buybacks unless the supervisor is confident\nthat systemic institutions are resilient to even severe stress. Financial institutions should be able\nto effectively intermediate throughout the cycle, including under severely stressed economic\nconditions, if supervisors successfully utilize stress tests.\nBut we must also be focusing on what will happen if a severe economic shock does\nfundamentally impair intermediaries. In that case, mitigating more severe economic dislocations\nin the broader economy should be a primary concern, not a secondary one.8\n\nTrade-offs in Supervisory and Regulatory Policymaking\nSupervisory policymaking involves a balancing of macroeconomic trade-offs. When\naddressing the financial condition of an institution, policymakers must be attuned to the broader\nimpacts that can occur with the disruption of the vital intermediation services that lubricate\neconomic activity.\nCapital regulation provides a relatively simple but very important example of the tradeoffs inherent in supervisory and regulatory policymaking. Maintaining standards for lossabsorbing capital has long been central to bank regulation. However, the specifics of how that\nregulation is implemented can have very different implications for the broader economy.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFor example, a bank that falls below its regulatory capital-to-assets ratio can take one of\ntwo paths – raise new capital (by raising new equity or retaining earnings), or shrink assets (by\nselling assets or reducing lending, because loans are assets for financial institutions). These\nalternatives can differ in important ways, of course – for example, in the speed with which each\noption accomplishes recapitalization. But they also differ crucially in the impact they may have\non the availability of credit to individuals and companies – essentially, in the institutions’ ability\nto continue to effectively and efficiently provide credit, and function as a financial intermediary.\nChoosing to increase capital by suspending dividends or not repurchasing shares has the\nadvantage of having less of an impact on borrowers seeking credit, but it is likely to increase\ncapital only very gradually – particularly if the operating environment is one in which net\nincome is low.9\nAlternatively, issuing new equity to bolster loss-absorbing capital can be done relatively\nquickly. While it dilutes existing shareholders, if done proactively it can stave off severe\nfinancial stress on the institution.10\nTurning to the assets in the capital-to-assets ratio – the denominator – we should note that\nthe approach involving reducing lending can take time, since it works primarily through new\nloans, not existing ones. Moreover, a bank is limited in its ability to immediately curtail lending,\ngiven that it has previously committed to lines of credit (including the unused portions) and has\nmade loan commitments to its customers. However, the reduction in lending is likely to result in\na dearth of needed credit for individuals and companies, and thus a weaker economy.11\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nMoreover, tighter loan terms change the calculations inherent in business plans, and may\nlead firms and entrepreneurs to reduce their borrowing. The reduction in credit extension by\nintermediaries may also partially offset the stimulative effects of accommodative monetary\npolicy that the central bank is usually implementing in economic downturns.\nIn contrast, selling off assets can be accomplished relatively quickly. But depending on\nthe asset and the prevailing economic conditions, the sales may have to occur at deeply\ndiscounted or even “fire sale” prices. However, an important nuance to recognize is that asset\nsales at much-reduced prices can affect the institution’s capital too,12 with the losses on the asset\nsales feeding through to reduced net worth (capital).13\nThe speed of the recapitalization is important for several reasons. Certainly, quickly\nrecapitalizing makes the financial system more resilient to continuing or future adverse shocks,\nand thus may help insulate the economy from future disruptions in the intermediation process.\nHowever, a more rapid recapitalization, if accomplished through shrinking assets, can also harm\nthe broader economy if it entails a significant tightening of lending standards, and thus credit\navailability.14 Again, as is often the case with economic policy making, the supervisory process\nis a balancing of macroeconomic trade-offs.\nCertainly, history shows a number of examples of supervisors taking different approaches\nto these trade-offs. In the United States, the recession in the early 1990s was exacerbated by\nbinding capital requirements. Many banks addressed their binding capital ratios by reducing\nlending and tightening credit standards, and bank supervisors did not emphasize the need to\nrecapitalize in ways that were less disruptive to the broader economy. This supervisory response\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nspawned an academic literature on credit crunches, highlighting how supervisory practice could\nadversely impact the real economy. Ultimately, the credit crunch was cited as a headwind to the\nrecovery, at a time requiring more stimulative monetary policy.15\nAs Figure 1 shows, after the 1990 recession, the level of real lending to businesses\ndeclined significantly, and in a way that had not occurred in the previous or subsequent\nrecession.16 Arguably, in the early 1990s, not enough consideration was given to avoiding a\nsituation where supervisory capital ratios were primarily achieved by tightening lending\n(shrinking assets). Less collateral damage to borrowers may have occurred if supervision had\ntaken the tack of more forcefully requiring retention of earnings or the raising of new equity\ncapital.\nA very different supervisory approach occurred in 2009. The first supervisory “stress\ntest” exercise – which followed the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s (TARP) funding that\nboosted institutions’ capital with investment of public funds – required that recapitalization not\nbe accomplished by shrinking assets. Given that demand for loans declined during the recession,\nthere was still a significant drop in business lending, but it would likely have been much more\nsevere if bank supervisors had not discouraged banks from meeting capital requirements\nprimarily by reducing lending.17 In part, the supervisory approach looked to recapitalize banks\nquickly, but to do it in a way that would have less severe “collateral damage” to the economy.\nImportantly, we can examine the experience in other countries. Countries experiencing\nsevere shocks have tended to see extremely slow progress in recapitalizing their banking system.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAnd some countries where the government did recapitalize the banks, such as Japan, did so only\nafter a long delay.\nIndeed, following the Japanese banking problems of the 1990s, the authorities counted on\nbank earnings to recapitalize the banking sector – but this was handicapped by continued\ndeclines in stock and real estate prices in Japan’s economy. Studies have observed that the long\ndelays in recapitalizing the banks and reducing problem loans generated a misallocation of loans,\nwhich had a broader adverse impact on the country’s economy.18\nIt is my strongly held view that supervisors can effectively help prevent systemic events\nif sufficiently high capital standards are required and rigorous stress tests are regularly\nconducted. Ideally, bank regulation and supervision will help make financial intermediaries\nsufficiently resilient so that even severe economic shocks would not badly impair financial\nintermediaries over the entire business cycle. This is the logic behind using stress tests to ensure\nthat banks are resilient before they are approved to pay out earnings, which of course depletes\ncapital. Before the introduction of the post-crisis stress tests, banks were allowed to continue to\npay dividends in 2007 and 2008, which resulted in a much greater need to recapitalize.\nThankfully, the stress tests now provide a much more proactive way to address the potential of\nsevere shocks before they occur.\nHowever, if a shock or event occurs, and banks prove to be not sufficiently resilient, it is\ncritically important to proactively recapitalize the banking sector as quickly as possible while at\nthe same time avoiding collateral damage from tighter credit standards. Put another way, with\nrespect to the capital-to-assets ratio, it is vital to increase the capital (the numerator of the ratio)\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrather than allowing the adjustment to occur primarily through a reduction in assets, i.e. loans\n(the denominator).\nCurrently, there continue to be varying responses to the question. The Basel III accord\nmade clear the existence of a broad international consensus to better capitalize banks.19\nHowever, countries have taken different approaches to interpreting how low the acceptable\nminimum level of capital can be – and different approaches to reaching the higher capital\nstandards. Countries that only slowly build up their banking sector’s resilience do risk, in my\nview, more severe repercussions should their economies encounter additional significant adverse\nshocks.\n\nThe Largest Institutions\nFigure 2 provides the minimum Basel III leverage ratios applied to the largest and most\nsystemically important institutions in several developed countries – the so-called Global\nSystemically Important Banking organizations, or GSIBs. You see that countries have chosen\ndifferent minimum leverage ratios to apply to the largest institutions. In the United States, the\nGSIBs are required, by 2018, to have 5 percent leverage ratios for the holding company.20\nSwitzerland has set similarly high leverage ratios. In contrast, the Eurozone and Japan have yet\nto require a higher minimum leverage ratio for the largest institutions – above the 3 percent\nleverage ratio – although additional requirements for GSIBs are under discussion by the Basel\nCommittee’s Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS).21\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThese variations reflect different trade-offs made across jurisdictions – trade-offs\nconcerning the size of GSIBs relative to the GDP of the country, the willingness of governments\nto risk large bank failures, and concern over how higher capital standards will impact the largest\nbanks in the country as well as the broader economy.\nFigure 3 shows, for different countries or regions, the recent leverage ratios for GSIBs\nand the fully-phased-in Basel III leverage ratio requirement. While the transition rules do not\nrequire fully meeting the regulatory requirements until 2018, the average GSIB Basel III\nleverage ratio in the U.S. already exceeds the fully-phased-in requirement.22 How quickly\nfinancial institutions have boosted capital ratios, and the size of the loss-absorbing buffer,\npresumably reflects different market pressures – but also different supervisory pressure to raise\ncapital ratios.\nIn the U.S., an important supervisory tool has been the use of stress tests. Here the\nrigorous application of stress tests, and the desire of institutions to have comfortable buffers\nagainst future stress tests, have encouraged GSIBs to quickly improve their capital ratios.\nThe different supervisory and regulatory goals across jurisdictions reflect different tradeoffs, but also make the country or region’s financial sector more or less susceptible to additional\nadverse shocks. Figure 4 shows global stock indices since December 1, 2015. The global\nfinancial market turmoil that occurred at the beginning of 2016 has resulted in declines in stock\nmarket indices around the world. This chart shows, however, that there are differences across\ncountries and regions. For example, the United States and the United Kingdom are currently\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nonly modestly below December 1 levels, reflecting the relatively strong U.S. and U.K.\neconomies, while Japan and the Eurozone show a more negative impact.\nFigure 5 shows differences in credit default swap (CDS) spreads of GSIB institutions\nacross countries, scaled relative to December 1. GSIB CDS have been sensitive to global\nturmoil, and rose quite significantly in February. More recently, although volatility has\ncontinued, there has been substantial improvement among countries that saw the most dramatic\nincreases in CDS spreads. While these differences likely reflect macroeconomic risks by\ncountry, they also likely reflect investors’ views of potential financial concerns related to GSIBs\nin that country.\nFigure 6 shows the differences in stock prices of GSIBs by country. Again the U.S.\nGSIBs have fared better, experiencing a lesser decline than counterparts in the Eurozone,\nSwitzerland, and Japan, likely reflecting a better macroeconomic outlook – as well as a relatively\nstronger financial position even as global markets have become more volatile. A more proactive\nsupervisory push to make U.S. GSIBs more resilient has been appropriate and, as this figure\nsuggests, beneficial – as evidenced by market reaction to recent global volatility.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would observe that the extensive regulation and\nsupervision of financial institutions reflects the important role that they, as financial\nintermediaries, play in the economy. In particular, higher capital and rigorous stress tests should\nmake GSIBs more resilient over time. But, as I have discussed today, there are trade-offs to\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncarefully consider. Policymakers need to balance the resilience that higher capital ratios bring\nagainst the possibility of pullback in the provision of credit, and downstream impacts on the\nability of firms and households to borrow and invest.\nWhile the distribution of losses when financial institutions fail is very important, the\nprimary goal of supervision should be to create effective intermediaries that can support the\nbroader economy throughout the business cycle including periods of stress. I am in favor of\nusing bank supervision to more quickly insulate the largest financial institutions from adverse\neconomic shocks that may emerge. But ideally, this would be done in ways that also encourage\nfinancial intermediaries to continue lending. I am happy to observe that in the United States,\nbanks have been able to significantly improve capital ratios while still expanding their lending.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act begins with: “To promote the financial stability\nof the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to\nprotect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices,\nand for other purposes…”\n2\n\nSee the speech by Federal Reserve Governor Jerome H. Powell, “Ending ‘Too Big to Fail,’” March 4, 2013. This\nspeech highlights the too big to fail phenomenon.\n3\n\nFor more discussion of how the probability of failure and cost of failure have been reduced in the United States,\nsee “Progress on Addressing 'Too Big To Fail',” Eric S. Rosengren, BCBS-FSI High-level Meeting for Africa\nfocused on Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Current Regulatory Priorities, held in Cape Town, South\nAfrica, Feb. 4, 2016.\n4\n\nIn particular, the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity proposal, or TLAC, would force large banks’ bondholders to\ndirectly suffer losses in the event of failure.\n5\n\nSupervision and Regulation Letters, such as SR 12-17, provide detailed discussions of the consolidated supervision\nframework for large financial institutions. Two primary objectives for bank supervision are provided: see\n“Enhancing resiliency of a firm to lower the probability of its failure or inability to serve as a financial\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nintermediary,” and “Reducing the impact on the financial system and the broader economy in the event of a firm’s\nfailure or material weakness.”\n6\n\nSee, for example, “What Do a Million Banks Have to Say about the Transmission of Monetary Policy?,” Anil K\nKashyap and Jeremy C. Stein, June, 1997. American Economic Review, 90, 407–28.\n7\n\nIn the event of an institution’s dissolution, the arrangements for how its losses are allocated among equity holders,\nbondholders, and taxpayers, are – of course – highly important after the fact. But how the rules for this allocation\nare set before the fact are also extremely important – they can affect financial incentives in critical ways, and thus\nthe behavior of both the financial intermediaries and those who fund them.\n8\n\nStress tests are ideally suited to ensure that banks are resilient during difficult economic circumstances.\n\n9\n\nThis leaves the institution vulnerable during the slow recapitalization process to any additional adverse economic\nshocks, which would require an even greater accumulation of capital.\n10\n\nIn addition, proactively issuing new equity to bolster loss-absorbing capital can also allow future capital actions to\nrecalibrate once markets stabilize.\n11\n\nOf course, how much a reduction in bank lending affects the nonfinancial economy depends, in part, on whether\nborrowers have access to alternative credit suppliers, and on what terms. During the financial crisis, larger firms\nsubstituted bond finance for bank finance, but that option was not available to all firms.\n12\n\nCan affect the numerator as well as the denominator of the capital-to-assets ratio.\n\n13\n\nSuch sales may also affect the health of other financial institutions by reducing the market value of their assets,\nand thus their capital.\n14\n\nI would underline the trade-offs between addressing the financial condition of the institution expeditiously, and\nthe broader impacts that can occur with the disruption of vital intermediation services that lubricate economic\nactivity.\n15\n\nFor a discussion of this period, see “The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower Nor a Lender Be,” Joe Peek and Eric\nRosengren, 1991. Also see, “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch,” Joe Peek and Eric Rosengren, 1993.\n16\n\nThe chart shows the decline in commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans outstanding.\n\n17\n\nThe emphasis on capital adjustment rather than shrinking assets stemmed further deterioration, and probably\nmitigated problems of credit access – although credit was certainly impaired, regardless, given the severity of the\ncrisis.\n18\n\nSee \"Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan,\" Ricardo J. Caballero, Takeo Hoshi, and Anil K.\nKashyap, 2008. See also \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan,” Joe\nPeek and Eric S. Rosengren, 2005.\n19\n\nSee http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm.\n\n20\n\nImplementation dates vary by country. For example, the date is Jan. 1, 2018 for the U.S., the Eurozone, and Japan,\nwhereas the date is Jan. 1, 2019 for the U.K., and Dec. 31, 2019 for Switzerland.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL March 18, 2016 at 11 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at Colby College\nWaterville, Maine\nFebruary 16, 2016\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nGood evening. It is a pleasure to be in Maine, and to be speaking here at my alma mater.\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I will express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nBefore commenting on the national economy, allow me to say that I have been very\nimpressed by the actions of Colby College and President Green in contributing to economic\nresurgence here in Waterville, Maine. So-called “anchor” institutions are critically important to\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe development of small cities, and an economically vibrant Waterville can pay large dividends\nfor all of central Maine.\nThe recent announcement1 that Collaborative Consulting will open operations in\nWaterville is an important initial step in returning jobs to an area of the state heavily impacted by\nretrenchment in lumber and manufacturing industries over the past 50 years. The collaborative\nwork of state and local government, local business leaders, and anchor institutions (like a Colby\nCollege) represents one of the key ingredients that Boston Fed research by Kodrzycki and\nMuñoz has indicated can lead to rejuvenated cities.2 And progress in small and mid-sized “post\nmanufacturing” cities is vital to the economic success of so many Americans, given the large\nshare of the population that lives in and around them.\nTurning to the national economy, in December the FOMC raised short-term rates for the\nfirst time since the financial crisis, by a quarter of a point. That decision reflected further\nimprovement in a range of recent labor market indicators, confirming that underutilization of\nlabor resources has diminished – and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will return to 2\npercent, the inflation target set by the Federal Reserve, over the medium term.3\nWhile labor markets have continued to improve gradually, headwinds generated from\nabroad have created more volatile financial markets and concerns that U.S. domestic growth may\nbe impeded by these headwinds and inflation may not move as quickly to the inflation target.\nThe FOMC has made clear in the statements released after its meetings that future\nincreases in interest rates will depend, in part, on “actual and expected progress toward” our\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ninflation goal. My focus today will be the recent inflation data and the prospects of a return to\nthe 2 percent target level for inflation.\nWhile most observers expect that the appreciation of the dollar and the fall in oil prices\nwill eventually stabilize, recent global events may make it less likely that the 2 percent inflation\ntarget will be achieved as quickly as had been projected in recent forecasts by private economists\nor by Federal Reserve policymakers. In my own view, if inflation is slower to return to target,\nmonetary policy normalization should be unhurried. A more gradual approach is an appropriate\nresponse to headwinds from abroad that slow exports, and financial volatility that raises the cost\nof funds to many firms.4 Of course, my view could change if we were to experience a more\nrapid abatement of headwinds, or much stronger domestic economic growth than I am currently\nanticipating.\nRather than expecting some sort of precise forward guidance, it is better for observers to\nrecognize that monetary policy will be responsive to incoming economic data. Monetary policy\nwill adjust when the accumulated data alter policymakers’ combined outlook. For example, data\ncoming in much stronger than forecast would result in interest rates going up more quickly than\nprojections and, in contrast, data much weaker than forecast would result in interest rates going\nup more slowly than projections. It is important to view the interest rate projections of Fed\npolicymakers found in the Summary of Economic Projections (or SEP) not as a promise, but\nrather as a projection of the path of rates if the economy evolves as expected. As incoming data\nalter those expectations, those projections can, and should, change.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M.

Stock\nmarket prices in major developed countries have fallen, with European and Japanese stock\nmarkets declining by more than 10 percent. Particularly notable is the decline in Japan, despite\nthe fact that monetary policy there has become more accommodative. Moreover, the country is\nan oil importer and, as such, should enjoy a net benefit from significantly lower energy prices.\nWith energy prices having declined quite significantly of late, measures of total inflation\nin most developed economies are quite low, with many hovering around zero. However, even\nwithout food and energy prices, core inflation rates remain well below 2 percent in many\nindustrial economies, as Figure 2 shows. While core PCE inflation in the United States is 1.4\npercent, well below the inflation target of 2 percent, it is nonetheless higher than in Japan,\nEurope, or the U.K.\nFigure 3 shows how far oil prices have fallen. The current price of oil is near the lows\nthat occurred during the Great Recession. While the core inflation measure removes the direct\nimpact of lower food and energy prices, there are still indirect effects because energy prices are\nan important input to many final goods. The declines to date in energy costs are likely to bring\nabout continued temporary downward pressure on core inflation, at least through the spring of\nthis year.\nMy assessment is that the energy price decline likely reflects a combination of supply and\ndemand factors. The introduction of improved technology in oil extraction has greatly increased\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsupply. In addition, the slowdown in global demand has likely contributed additional downward\npressure on energy prices. However, other commodity prices have also experienced significant\ndeclines. Figure 4 provides a broad non-energy commodity index and Figure 5 provides an\nagricultural commodity index.5 The decline in many commodities outside of energy is one\nreason that some analysts have been concerned with a possible broader decline in the global\neconomy.6\nFigure 6 illustrates another temporary restraint on U.S. inflation. The dollar has\nappreciated sharply over the past 18 months, as reflected in the trade-weighted currency\nexchange index.7 Of course, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar poses a challenge to exportdependent businesses. The appreciation of the dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive to our\ntrading partners and their exported goods cheaper for us. But the dollar appreciation also arises\nbecause global trading partners are experiencing weaker economic growth, requiring further\nmonetary accommodation, at the same time that the United States has experienced relatively\nstrong growth and has just begun to raise short-term rates. The higher-valued dollar makes\nimported goods cheaper, reducing U.S. inflation, as it raises the cost of U.S.-produced goods to\nforeign buyers. Exchange rate movements, much like energy price shocks, are likely to only\ntemporarily depress core inflation; but still, these temporary factors make it unlikely that we will\nexperience significant increases in total or core inflation in the near term.\nFurthermore, there is one way that these temporary downward pressures on reported\ninflation could pose more permanent impediments to reaching the 2 percent inflation goal – if\ninflation expectations were to change as households and firms viewed the prospects for future\ninflation differently. Figure 7 provides a relatively new measure from the Federal Reserve Bank\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof New York of consumers’ expected inflation rate one and three years ahead. The survey does\nshow a gradual but clear downward trend in inflation expectations over the past several years.\nThis suggests we cannot take for granted that regular, persistent, but seemingly temporary shocks\nto inflation will not have a larger and more lasting impact.\n\nInflation Forecasts\nFigure 8 provides the SEP forecasts for core inflation each December for the past four\nyears. The forecasts all follow a similar pattern. At the time the forecast is made, core inflation\nis well below the 2 percent target. Over the course of the three-year forecast, inflation is\nprojected to gradually increase and to generally fall just a bit short of the 2 percent target.\nHowever, Figure 9 shows that the forecasts for a persistent drift up in core inflation have not\nbeen realized in actual inflation outcomes.\nOne interpretation of this pattern is that FOMC participants have been persistently\nsurprised by transitory shocks to oil prices and the dollar, both of which have tended to depress\ninflation in recent years. However, a more troubling alternative would be that consistently\nmissing on the inflation target reflects a change in the inflation process – for example, if inflation\nexpectations were becoming less well anchored. Declines in surveys and market measures of\ninflation expectations would then imply a more serious impediment to achieving the 2 percent\ninflation target.\nFigure 10 shows that inflation across spending components has varied quite a bit. For\nexample, the housing component of the PCE index has risen more than 2 percent over the past\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nyear, while durable and non-durable goods prices have fallen. While this reflects relative supply\nand demand factors – as well as sensitivity to exchange rates – one might expect that a\nstabilization of the exchange rate would relieve some downward pressures in industries facing\nsignificant price competition from imports.\nAnother factor that would raise confidence that inflation will pick up as transitory factors\nabate, would be the continuing tightening of labor markets. The unemployment rate is currently\nat 4.9 percent. If U.S. economic growth induced additional tightening of labor markets, one\nmight expect to see wages and salaries picking up in industries where demand is particularly\nstrong. Figure 11 shows that average hourly earnings and wages and salaries for private workers\nhave been slowly increasing.8 While the increases are more modest than those seen in previous\nrecoveries, the gradual upward trend, were it to continue, would make me more confident of\nreaching the 2 percent inflation target.\nFigure 12 provides wages and salaries by occupational grouping. No occupational group\nyet shows evidence of sufficient tightness in labor markets to require significantly higher wages\nand salaries. In sum, there is not much evidence of significant bottlenecks by occupational\ngrouping, but overall there is some drifting up of wages and salaries more generally.\n\nConcluding Observations\nAt the December meeting of the FOMC when rates were raised by a quarter of a\npercentage point, the Committee released its projections, which generally expected that the\neconomy would grow a little faster than 2 percent, as shown in Figure 13. However, actual\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngrowth in 2015 (measured from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015) was 1.8\npercent and fell just below the SEP forecast range shown in Figure 13, as fourth quarter growth\nwas only 0.7 percent. The slowdown among some global trading partners, the decline in global\nstock prices, and the strong U.S. dollar could result in slower growth going forward than was\nexpected at the time of that December meeting. While it is likely that much of the fourthquarter weakness is due to temporary factors – for example, a modest inventory adjustment – if\nmore pronounced global weakness were to materialize and be transmitted to the U.S., I\npersonally believe there would be little need to raise rates until the economy was growing closer\nto its potential rate.\nHowever, even with growth at or above potential, the outlook for actual and expected\ninflation remains uncertain. Figure 14 shows the most recent SEP median forecast for the\nfederal funds rate. The median forecast was for the federal funds rate to increase by a percentage\npoint over the course of 2016. However, the SEP forecasts are made based on information\navailable at that time. If the economy comes in significantly weaker (or stronger) than was\nexpected at the time of the SEP forecast, or if we see noticeably less (or more) progress on\ninflation than was expected, that precise interest rate path would no longer be appropriate, in my\nview.\nSince the December publication of the Summary of Economic Projections, we have seen\noil prices decline and global stock indices become more volatile – and more generally a lack of\ninflationary pressures and the presence of global headwinds that make future economic growth\nsomewhat more uncertain. Should these conditions persist, and slow progress on attaining the\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 16, 2016 at 7:40 P.M.

But the path of interest rates\ncould be steeper or more gradual, depending on the incoming data.\n5\n\nAs a broad index, the S&P GSCI Non-Energy Commodity Price Index does include agricultural commodities, so\nthere is some overlap between the indices.\n6\n\nWhile Figure 4 shows a decline in the Non-Energy Commodities Price Index on a monthly basis through January,\ndaily figures show a rise in the index beginning on January 12 th. Although the increase has leveled off in early\nFebruary, on a daily basis the index is now above its monthly average for December.

(This attribution should be\nviewed with caution, however, as the BLS notes that the indices excluding incentive paid occupations are not strictly\ncomparable with the other series.)\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Financial Stability Institute\nCape Town, South Africa\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nGood morning. I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky and the Financial Stability Institute\nof the Bank for International Settlements for the invitation to discuss progress in the United\nStates on eliminating the “too big to fail” phenomenon.1 This is an important topic, and one that\nhas received extensive attention by bank regulators and supervisors in the United States.\nOf course, the views I will express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, the primary legislative response in the U.S. was\nenactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Act begins\nwith the following phrases:\n“To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving\naccountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to\nprotect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from\nabusive financial services practices, and for other purposes…”\n\nThis language suggests little ambiguity about the intent of Congress, stressing that the\nlegislative response to the crisis was intended to end “too big to fail” (which I’ll refer to today as\nTBTF) and end financial-sector bailouts. The regulations necessary to carry out this intent are\nquite extensive, and despite the legislation being enacted in 2010, some of the regulations are\nstill being finalized by the regulatory agencies or are being phased in over a number of years.\nBoth the Dodd-Frank legislation and the regulations implementing it involve a wide\nvariety of topics relevant to, and designed to address, TBTF. Today, I will focus my remarks on\ntwo areas where there has been substantial progress:\n\n\nThe first area involves increased capital buffers aimed at reducing the probability\nof failures. The largest financial institutions – which had been thinly capitalized\ngoing into the financial crisis – have significantly increased their capital, as a\nresult of a variety of supervisory and regulatory initiatives designed to reduce the\nprobability of failure. Today I will highlight two tools in particular –\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress testing, and the U.S.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nGlobal Systemically Important Bank Holding Company (GSIB) capital surcharge\n– which have contributed to higher capital ratios.\n\n\n\nThe second area involves steps to reduce spill-over from one troubled institution\nto others – essentially, reducing the cost of failures. A variety of actions, most of\nwhich are in the process of being implemented, would reduce the likelihood that a\nlarge financial institution’s failure would end up being a systemically\ndestabilizing event. These actions include requiring banks to issue enough debt\nso that taxpayer funds would not be necessary in the event of a resolution, and\nrequiring firms to provide resolution plans to regulators with the goal that a\nfailure would not have a broad impact on the overall economy.\n\nBefore launching into these two topics, let me just briefly mention some other areas that\nare important and relevant to TBTF, but which our time constraints will not allow me to address\nin any depth today.\nThe first such issue is the shift in the clearing of some derivatives to central\ncounterparties (discussed last November by Bill Dudley of the New York Fed, and Governor\nJerome Powell of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors).2 During the financial crisis that\nbegan in the fall of 2008, the vast number of firm-to-firm derivatives transactions made it\ndifficult to assess the extent of counterparty risk, as there was no central conduit through which\nthese transactions flowed and were recorded. Now, because many more derivative contracts are\nbeing centrally cleared, transparency about derivative exposures has been improved. In addition,\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecent regulations will increase margin requirements on those derivative contracts that are not\ncentrally cleared.\nA second important issue we will not have as much time to cover today is the application\nof regulations to non-bank, systemically important financial institutions. During the crisis, a\nlarge insurance company, AIG, had extensive derivatives exposure that generated significant risk\nto counterparties. In addition, some non-bank financial institutions were poorly supervised at the\nholding company level; others were significantly impaired by their dependence on short-term\nwholesale funding when such funding virtually disappeared in the fall of 2008 (as discussed by\nFed Governor Dan Tarullo in speeches last fall).3 To address these problems, the Financial\nStability Oversight Counsel (FSOC) – the federal agency charged with, among other things,\nidentifying and addressing threats to U.S. financial stability – can designate non-bank financial\ninstitutions as systemically important, thus subjecting them to supervision by the Federal\nReserve and enhanced prudential standards.4\nA third matter involves the extensive use of Federal Reserve liquidity facilities during the\nfinancial crisis by U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations. Specifically, many of these\norganizations turned to Fed facilities because they were highly dependent on short-term\nwholesale funding, which dried up during the financial crisis. As a consequence, large foreign\nbanking organizations are now required to form intermediate holding companies covering most\nof their activities in the United States. This is an effort to increase the resiliency of their\noperations by, among other things, subjecting them to the same capital standards as their U.S.\ncounterparts, and stress testing requirements.5\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nA fourth area is a set of major changes establishing new liquidity requirements. Events in\nthe financial crisis exposed the fact that many financial institutions had become reliant on funds\nthat could quickly “run” should the firm experience financial stress (or be perceived as\nexperiencing such stress). The regulatory tools – known as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),\nthe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review\n(CLAR) – are all intended to make financial firms more resilient to liquidity shocks.6\nThis is far from a comprehensive list of the major changes that have either been made or\nare underway to address the issue of TBTF institutions. But my goal is to highlight the reality\nthat truly addressing TBTF involves much more than prudential regulation of individual large\nbanks. Given the complexity involved and the limited time we have today, I will focus on\nGSIBs and the two issues I mentioned at the outset – increased capital and steps to reduce the\nspillover of problems from one institution to others and the financial system.\n\nBackground on U.S. GSIBs\nFigure 1 shows the total assets of the eight U.S. GSIBs for the third quarter of 2010 and\nthe third quarter of 2015. The four largest GSIBs all have assets well over $1 trillion and include\nBank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. The next two largest GSIBs,\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have assets well over $500 billion and notably have very\nlarge broker-dealer businesses. The two smallest GSIBs, Bank of New York Mellon and State\nStreet, have assets well below $500 billion but are processing banks that are responsible for\nsignificant back-office activities for financial market participants, and as such have external\nassets under management and under custody.7\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile two of the largest banks have reduced their size over the past five years,8 they still\nhave assets that exceed $1.5 trillion and both had some of the most significant, well-documented\nproblems during the financial crisis. In sum, despite the regulations designed to reduce TBTF, a\nnumber of the largest U.S. GSIBs have grown significantly over the past five years.\nFigure 2 shows U.S. GSIB banking assets and their share of U.S. banking industry\nassets. U.S. GSIB banking assets have grown for most of the past five years and now exceed\n$7.5 trillion, although there has been some decline more recently. As a group, total GSIB assets\nare a little greater than 40 percent of U.S. GDP. Moreover, GSIB assets represent a sizeable 50\npercent of banking industry assets, down slightly from the post-crisis level.\nGiven that GSIBs are still a significant presence, how can it be argued that the problem of\nTBTF is seeing significant progress? It is important to remember that many of the new\nregulations that are designed to provide incentives for banks to shrink are fairly recent, and many\nhave full implementation dates several years in the future. So it may be premature to judge what\nsize GSIBs are likely to be once the full set of TBTF regulations is implemented. But I do\nbelieve the most important progress on TBTF to date involves reducing the probability that these\ninstitutions will fail – and should they fail, reducing the risks they would pose to the entire\neconomy. I will now share some perspectives on progress made and underway in that regard.\n\nReducing the Probability of U.S. GSIB failure\nThere have been a variety of changes made to the supervision of GSIBs as a result of the\nfinancial crisis. Perhaps the most crucial change has been the introduction of the CCAR,9 which\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nexamines the ability of large bank holding companies to withstand stressful economic and\nfinancial conditions (as discussed by Governor Dan Tarullo).10 Should the Federal Reserve find\na bank’s capital inadequate under the stresses modeled in the CCAR exercise, the Fed can object\nto capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends or stock repurchases. In addition to the\nCCAR’s quantitative stress analysis, bank holding companies are assessed qualitatively on their\ncapital planning process, which can also result in limitations on capital distributions.\nFigure 3 provides the U.S. GSIBs’ actual Tier 1 leverage ratio in the third quarter of\n2014 and the minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio that was estimated to arise in the CCAR’s severely\nadverse scenario conducted at that time.11 The scenarios model significant adverse shocks to the\nbanks – most of the GSIBs under the severely adverse scenario experience declines in their Tier\n1 leverage ratio of more than 2 percentage points, but all remain above 4 percent. The size of the\ndecline can vary significantly across GSIBs, which is unsurprising given their very different\nbusiness models which can be more or less impacted by a particular set of stress assumptions.\nThe CCAR is a flexible supervisory tool, in that supervisors can alter the stress scenario\nto reflect those financial and economic situations that they deem to pose, currently, the biggest\nconcerns. Since the scenarios change from year to year, the GSIBs need to maintain a capital\ncushion sufficient to exceed minimum capital standards under a variety of potential stress\nsituations.\nIn sum, the utilization of stress tests has been a major change in the supervisory process,\nand has caused GSIBs to reduce risks in areas that might lose significant capital under stressful\nconditions – or alternatively has caused GSIBs to plan on holding significantly more capital\nagainst those risks.\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn addition to the stress testing required by the Dodd-Frank Act, a number of regulatory\nchanges have also significantly altered the capital regulation of GSIBs. While I will address\ntoday the surcharge most directly focused on the GSIBs, it is important to remember that there\nhave been other substantial changes to capital regulation since the financial crisis.12 The GSIB\ncapital surcharge I am highlighting is a surcharge imposed on GSIBs to reflect the systemic risk\nposed by these organizations because of the size and complexity of their operations.\nAs Fed Chair Janet Yellen has noted, “A key purpose of the capital surcharge is to\nrequire the firms themselves to bear the costs that their failure would impose on others. In\npractice, this final rule will confront these firms with a choice: they must either hold substantially\nmore capital, reducing the likelihood that they will fail, or else they must shrink their systemic\nfootprint, reducing the harm that their failure would do to our financial system. Either outcome\nwould enhance financial stability.”13\nThe GSIB surcharge is imposed in addition to the minimum 4.5 percent common equity\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Based on data\navailable at the time of adoption, estimates suggest the surcharge would range from 1.0 to 4.5\npercent and would be phased in over time, with the full effect of the regulation occurring in\nJanuary 2019.14\nThe GSIB surcharge is calibrated to reduce the GSIBs’ probability of default, with an eye\nto the impact of a failure on the broader financial system.15 The surcharge is calculated in two\nways, and the higher of the two surcharges is used. The first method considers the size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity of the\norganization – similar to international standards. The second method considers similar inputs but\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreplaces substitutability with a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.16 The size\nof the surcharge will depend on how banks respond by adjusting their inputs to minimize their\ncapital charge.\nThe effect of both the CCAR stress test and the GSIB surcharge is to significantly reduce\nthe probability that a GSIB fails. The combination of these and other capital regulations (as\nphased in) should result in a significant improvement in capital ratios for GSIBs. Figure 4\nshows the increases in the common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for this group over the\npast five years, even as new capital rules have, on net, increased risk-weightings.17 The common\nequity Tier 1 capital ratio for GSIBs now surpasses the ratio for non-GSIB institutions over $50\nbillion, as well as for non-GSIB institutions under $50 billion.\nFigure 5 shows that the Tier 1 leverage ratio for GSIB institutions has also steadily\nincreased. While the GSIB leverage ratio is still below that of non-GSIB institutions, this partly\nreflects a higher proportion of low-risk-weighted assets at GSIBs that get favorable capital\ntreatment under the risk-based capital ratio but not under the leverage ratio.\nI should note that all the capital regulations are not fully phased in, and the countercyclical capital buffer is currently zero, and the actual GSIB surcharge is dependent on actions\nthe banks may take to reduce the surcharge. In addition, it has not yet been decided by the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve whether GSIB institutions will be required to include all or\npart of the surcharge in the capital required by the CCAR. If they were required to, or if the\npost-stress CCAR minimums were increased by other means, the stress tests would be even more\nbinding on GSIB institutions. I would be in favor of such changes. My own personal view is\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat GSIB institutions should be required to increase post-stress minimums, through one means\nor another.\n\nReducing the Cost of U.S. GSIB failures\nIf, despite the stress tests and enhanced capital regulations, a GSIB were still to fail,\nactions have been taken to try to reduce the impact of that failure. Quite recently the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve proposed a rule for total loss-absorbing capacity or “TLAC.”\nThe purpose of TLAC is to insure that if a GSIB were to fail, sufficient debt financing would\nhave been employed so that taxpayer resources would not be needed in order to resolve the\ninstitution.\nThe proposal requires U.S. GSIBs to issue enough long-term debt so that if a GSIB fails\nand needs to be resolved, the debt could be converted to equity and negate the need for support\nfrom taxpayers. Figure 6 provides a depiction of the TLAC rule, assuming the fully phased-in\ncapital requirement.18\nIn addition to TLAC, the GSIBs are required to develop resolution plans or so-called\n“living wills,” covering how they could be resolved. Both the FDIC and the Federal Reserve\nmust agree to the resolution plan. Evaluation of the resolution plans is continuing, but when\naccepted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve these plans should provide additional protection\nfor taxpayer resources should a GSIB fail.\nThe combination of the TLAC proposal and resolution plans has caused ratings agency\nStandard & Poor’s to downgrade ratings on the non-operating holding companies of all the\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:15 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndomestic GSIBs, reflecting the enhanced possibility that there will not be government support\nshould the largest banks experience financial difficulty. It is noteworthy that Standard & Poor’s\ndid not downgrade the operating subsidiaries of these holding companies, since the creditors of\nthe holding company would be a source of funds for the operating subsidiaries. It is encouraging\nto see that rating agencies are viewing the actions taken as significantly reducing the TBTF\nproblem.\n\nConcluding Observations\nSignificant progress has been made in eliminating TBTF and the possibility that\ntaxpayers in the United States would need to bail out the domestic GSIBs to preserve the\nfinancial system’s functioning. But it is important to remember that significant work still\nremains. Some of the proposals need to be finalized, some of the regulations are only in the\nprocess of being phased in, and more work needs to be done on resolution plans to insure that\nGSIBs can be resolved in an orderly fashion.\nNonetheless, capital ratios at the GSIBs have been steadily increasing, with the goal of\nreducing the chances that a GSIB will fail. In the event that one does fail, the new TLAC\nproposal and resolution plans intend to reduce the potential costs to taxpayers of such a failure\nand make it less likely that there would be a need for any financial support from taxpayers to\npreserve financial system functioning.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL February 4, 2016 at 2:15 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPresentation to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJanuary 13, 2016\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. As we begin 2016,\nwe should acknowledge the significant improvement we saw in the U.S. economy over the past\nyear, which enabled policymakers to raise short-term rates in December. That good news\ncontinued with last Friday’s release of the latest employment report; the economy produced\n292,000 jobs in December, and we saw an average of 284,000 jobs added per month over the\npast quarter. Since the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent, it suggests that people\npreviously not in the labor force are entering the labor force and finding jobs. In addition, tighter\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlabor markets have helped reduce unemployment in some segments of the labor market that still\nhave elevated unemployment rates.1\nWhile the last employment report was quite strong, other news around the start of the\nNew Year has been less positive. Stock markets in much of the world began the year on a\ndecidedly weak note, with declines in the Chinese stock market generating particular attention.\nThese declines have been accompanied by weak oil and commodity prices, furthering the\nconcern that global growth has slowed significantly. In addition, estimates of growth for fourth\nquarter real GDP in the United States have been falling, raising the possibility that domestic\ngrowth could be slowing. While monetary policy should not overreact to short-term, temporary\nfluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should take seriously the potential downside\nrisks to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path\nfor monetary policy.\nAlso, since I will be covering a lot of ground and some key charts, data, and nuances of\nthe financial system, I would like to preview my “punch line,” so to speak:\n\n\nThe economy has reached an important milestone: the central bank raised short-term\nrates last month, reflecting the significant progress the U.S. economy has made over\nthe course of the last year.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve in midDecember, the initial monetary policy tightening was rather uneventful. The effective\nfederal funds rate has largely traded within the new target range. Other short-term\nrates in the marketplace have moved up as expected, and long-term rates were little\nchanged.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n\n\nThe future path of the federal funds rate will depend on incoming economic data,\nmost importantly on how that incoming data affects policymakers’ outlook for the\neconomy for the next year or two. I hope the economy continues to improve, so that\nfurther normalization is appropriate. It is important, however, to carefully manage\nrisks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad.\n\n\n\nFurther increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual.\n\nLet me note that the views I will express are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\nThe Beginning of Policy Normalization\nThe national unemployment rate started 2015 at 5.7 percent, and, over the course of the\nyear, fell to 5.0 percent. Much of this decline resulted from new job creation, with 2.65 million\njobs created from January 2015 through December. This is clearly good news for the economy,\nand it provided the conditions necessary for the Federal Reserve to finally begin removing some\nof the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was the necessary, appropriate, and\neffective response to the financial crisis, recession, and painfully slow recovery.\nWith continued improvements in the economy, it is now appropriate for the U.S. central\nbank to gradually return to a more normalized monetary policy. The first step in that gradual\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprocess was December’s increase in the federal funds rate target – the first rate increase since the\nGreat Recession.\nMy own assessment is that the first increase went quite smoothly. At the December\nmeeting, the FOMC set a target range for the federal funds rate of 0.25 to 0.50 percent, up a\nquarter of a percent (25 basis points) from the prior range of zero to 0.25 percent. Since then, the\nfederal funds rate has tended to trade in the market around 0.36 percent, about the middle of the\nnew target range. In addition, financial markets did not suffer any extreme swings around the\nrate increase, as some observers had predicted. Short-term rates moved roughly in line with the\nfederal funds rate, and long-term rates such as the 10-year Treasury rate remained near their\nlevels as of the middle of December, presumably because the Fed’s action was so widely\nanticipated. All in all, the response to the increase was quite uneventful and not much different\nthan expected.\nDespite this solid start, the extraordinarily high level of reserves in the banking system\nimpacts the monetary policy normalization process, and will likely cause this tightening cycle to\nbe somewhat different than previous tightening cycles. These reserves, I would point out, are the\nconsequence of the accommodative monetary policy that was necessary after our policy rate\ndropped to essentially zero (or hit the zero lower bound).\nToday I plan to discuss some of the key features of the current gradual normalization\nprocess, and highlight how these differ from previous practice. I think it is important to take\nsome time to describe them today – since some of the elements are new and different; and since\nthe mechanics of monetary policy are not especially well understood, but are deployed in the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npublic interest and to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress (maximum employment\nand stable prices).\nI will also discuss the outlook for the economy, particularly the lack of significant\ninflationary pressures in the United States and the weakness in many other parts of the world.\nUsually the tightening cycle is, at least in part, a reflection that inflationary pressures have\nalready begun to build. In contrast, today, core inflation has yet to show a clear movement\ntowards the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, and real GDP is projected to grow only\nsomewhat faster than potential. All this should result in a monetary policy that moves more\ngradually than in past tightening cycles.\n\nChanges in Monetary Policy Implementation\nMonetary policy affects everyone, and for about eight years now monetary policymaking\nhas been in quite an extraordinary period of change and innovation – of necessity, given\nconditions in the U.S. economy and around the world. Today I would like to walk you through\nsome of the recent and ongoing changes in monetary policy implementation in the U.S., where, I\nwould suggest, aggressive action led to results that have actually been more favorable than in\nmany other industrialized countries.\nFigure 1 reflects the dramatic increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that was a\nconsequence of the central bank purchasing Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, with the\naim of lowering long-term interest rates and offsetting some of the weakness brought on by the\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession. In the mechanics of central banking, we paid for these\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nassets by crediting banks with newly created reserves, which is how all those reserves got into\nthe banking system.\nPrior to the financial crisis, monetary policy operated by setting the target for the federal\nfunds rate, a short-term interest rate on overnight loans between banks. It did so by adjusting the\namount of money in the banking system – by adding or removing reserves through open market\noperations – and thus lowering or raising the rate at which banks were willing to lend and borrow\nin this overnight market.2 For example, the Federal Reserve could increase the supply of\nreserves by buying privately held Treasury securities, paying for the securities with reserves and\nthus injecting more reserves into the banking system. Because the amount of reserves in the\nsystem was relatively modest, small purchases and sales were sufficient to alter the target (and\nactual) federal funds rate.\nIn response to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve repeatedly lowered the federal\nfunds rate, eventually reducing its target to effectively zero by the end of 2008. But the economy\nremained weak. To further stimulate the economy with the federal funds rate at the zero lower\nbound, it was necessary to employ different monetary policy tools.3, 4\nWith the intent to lower long-term interest rates, the Federal Reserve purchased Treasury\nsecurities and mortgage-backed securities. As shown in Figure 2, the purchase of these assets\ndramatically changed the Fed’s balance sheet composition – from holding primarily short-term\nTreasury bills to holding a large quantity of mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasury\nsecurities. As desired, this had the effect of lowering long-term rates in the marketplace – with\nthe most direct impact on Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, prior to the financial crisis there were relatively few excess\nreserves in the financial system, and the federal funds rate could be adjusted with very small\nchanges in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet – the buying (or selling) of securities mentioned\nearlier. After the financial crisis, the desire to influence interest rates required purchasing large\nquantities of securities. And because the Federal Reserve paid for these assets with bank\nreserves, there was now a large quantity of excess reserves in the financial system.5 This large\nsupply of excess reserves constitutes a tremendous surplus, which would tend to keep the federal\nfunds rate at or very near zero.\nAs the economy improves, however, a federal funds rate close to zero is no longer\nappropriate. But as I’ve described, the usual way of raising the federal funds rate is not available\nto policymakers. Simply put, no modest sale of securities will remove enough excess reserves\nfrom the system to tighten borrowing conditions in the overnight federal funds market, because\nof the extremely large volume of excess reserves.\nSo, to increase the federal funds rate this time, the Federal Reserve needs to use new\ntools. These new tools are essentially borrowing facilities for which we control the interest rate,\nrather than relying on changing the balance of reserves in the banking system to influence\ninterest rates.\nThese administered rates help us create the top and bottom of the new target range for the\nfederal funds rate. Bear with me for a moment while I describe the mechanics.\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve the authorization to pay interest on reserves, effective\nOctober of 2008.6 Paying interest on reserves is an important tool as the Fed works to raise rates\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n– because banks can receive interest on reserves held overnight with the Federal Reserve, banks\nwill not want to lend at a rate below what they can get from holding funds with the Fed.\nThere is a caveat, however, worth a short digression. Non-banks do not hold funds at the\nFederal Reserve, and as a result, some non-banks are willing to lend overnight funds slightly\nbelow the interest rate banks get on reserves. This means that the federal funds rate has traded a\nbit below the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER).7 Arbitrage plays a role, however, in\npulling rates in the market towards the IOER: Since banks can earn the IOER, if overnight rates\nfall too far below the IOER, banks can make money by buying overnight funds below the IOER\nand holding those funds at the Federal Reserve where they receive the IOER.8\nTo insure that overnight rates will remain close to IOER and maintain the bottom of the\nnew target range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve has created another facility that\npurchases funds from non-banks at a rate slightly below IOER, currently at a rate of 0.25\npercent, in a reverse repurchase agreement transaction. Since the reverse repurchase agreement\ntransaction is collateralized and transacted with the central bank, and thus essentially riskless,\nthese investors should be unwilling to lend at a rate less than the reverse repurchase rate to any\nother borrower.\nBecause this option is available not only to banks, but also to money market funds and\nother financial institutions, this more widely available facility insures that, normally, overnight\nrates will trade between the rate the Fed pays on the reverse repurchase facility and the interest\nrate the Fed pays on excess reserves.9 Again, the rate on the reverse repurchase agreements\nestablishes the bottom of the Fed’s target range for the federal funds rate.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 4 provides the interest rate paid on reserves, the overnight reverse repurchase rate,\nand the effective federal funds rate in the marketplace. Prior to the December FOMC meeting,\nthe interest on reserves was set at 0.25 percent. After the December FOMC meeting, the interest\non reserves was set at 0.50 percent (the upper end of the target range) and the reverse repurchase\nrate was set at 0.25 percent (the lower end). The effective federal funds rate has traded in\nbetween those two rates – with the exception of December 31 – with the effective federal funds\nrate since the December FOMC meeting generally trading in the market at 0.36 percent.\nThe figure shows that the effective federal funds rate has adjusted just as desired, almost\nexactly in the middle of the target ranged established by the Federal Reserve, with the only\nexception being that rates fell below the floor on the last day of 2015. This largely reflects firms\nlooking to shrink their balance sheet or make their positions look less risky for end-of-year\nreporting. That situation aside, the policy-relevant interest rate moved as anticipated.\nFigure 5 shows the volume of Federal Reserve overnight reverse repurchase agreements.\nWith the federal funds rate trading well above the floor on most days, the volume of reverse\nrepurchases has been generally in line with the experience prior to raising rates. Granted, there\nwas elevated volume for one trading day at the end of the year, as firms adjusted balance sheets\nwith end-of-year reporting in mind. But the end of year activity was only somewhat higher than\nthe volume experienced at recent quarter-ends.10\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe Broader Impact of the First Tightening on Interest Rates\nWhile the short-term interest rate targeted by the Federal Reserve did act as expected\nsince the first increase, the goal of policymakers is of course to influence the broader economy.\nThat goal requires that our short-term interest rate changes are transmitted to a much broader\narray of interest rates and asset prices. It is important that other short-term rates that are\navailable to a broader set of investors also begin the process of normalization. Figure 6 provides\nseveral one-month rates – a commercial paper rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),\nand the Eurodollar deposit rate. These rates increased during the month of December, likely\nbecause markets widely anticipated the Fed’s action. This indicates that rates which normally\nrespond to short-term expected changes in the federal funds rate have responded to the first\ntightening, beginning the normalization process for a broader set of short-term rates in the\nmarketplace.\nLong-term rates are less directly impacted by the overnight federal funds rate. While\ntighter monetary policy generally increases long rates over time, other factors can significantly\ninfluence longer-term rates – things like prospects for inflation, the exchange rate, and the\ndemand for long-term Treasury securities. Furthermore, the expectation of some tightening may\nalready have been built into longer-term rates, which are likely to be affected by the likely path\nof rates as well as the current overnight rate. As Figure 7 shows, longer-term rates did not\nrespond significantly to the first tightening, likely reflecting the fact that the FOMC statement\nindicated strongly that the path of tightening was expected to be “only gradual.”\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 shows that the Treasury curve remains well below that of 10 years ago, before\nthe financial crisis. Thus while December’s first increase was the beginning of normalization,\nrates remain well below their pre-crisis levels.\n\nThe Recent Policy Statement\nWhile long-term Treasury rates reflect a variety of influences, the Federal Reserve’s\nearlier decision to purchase significant quantities of long-term Treasury securities is, in my view,\none reason for the low long-term rates we now see. It is important to point out that in the\nstatement announcing the first rate increase, the FOMC said that it would continue to reinvest\nprincipal payments until normalization of the federal funds rate was well underway.\nThe logic is to try to move short-term interest rates first, because we have greater\nconfidence in the likely effects of such a move on the economy, and also, because we will then\nhave the flexibility to respond if necessary to a large unexpected negative shock by reducing\nshort-term rates.11\nReducing the size of our balance sheet would also be a form of tightening, with more\nimpact on longer-term rates. If we were to tighten in that way, we would presumably not need to\nraise short-term rates as much. I am fully supportive of the strategy of focusing on short-term\nrates first, before allowing the balance sheet to shrink.\nThe FOMC statement also said that “The Committee expects that economic conditions\nwill evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”\nThis gradual notion reflects our best understanding of the current economic landscape:\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat the economy is growing relatively slowly for a tightening cycle, that the unemployment rate\nis expected to gradually hit full employment, and that inflation remains well below our 2 percent\ntarget – and will gradually approach it as labor markets improve further and other factors that are\ntemporarily depressing inflation recede.\n\nUnemployment, Inflation, and Rates: Policymakers’ Forecasts\nFigure 9 provides the unemployment rate projections through 2018 from Federal Reserve\npolicymakers. These projections are provided in the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) on a quarterly basis. The median forecast of Fed policymakers is for the\nunemployment rate to gradually drop to 4.7 percent and then remain there through 2018. The 4.7\npercent unemployment rate is consistent with my own estimate of full employment.\nThe unemployment rate forecast carries some risks. Figure 10 shows the path of the\nunemployment rate relative to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of full\nemployment (the “natural rate” of long-term unemployment). You can see that it is relatively\nunusual to have long periods of unchanged unemployment. Rather, the unemployment rate tends\nto fall well below the CBO estimate of full employment during most recoveries. Similarly, once\nthe unemployment rate begins to rise, it tends to increase well above the estimate of full\nemployment.\nAn unemployment rate falling more rapidly than in the forecast could potentially call for\na faster increase in the policy rate. However, such a risk should be managed within a context in\nwhich inflation has been typically lower than expected.12 Indeed, one reason for moving quite\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngradually on rate increases is that low rates may be necessary to achieve our inflation target over\nthe next several years.\nFigure 11 compares the core PCE rate of inflation with the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ninflation target. The core PCE inflation rate is currently 1.3 percent, and has remained below the\n2 percent inflation target for most of the recovery.\nThe projections in Figure 12 suggest that Fed policymakers expect to reach our inflation\ntarget by 2018. However, this path reflects only a gradual movement to the target, likely\ninformed by the “misses” we have experienced (see Figure 11).\nFigure 13 shows the federal funds rate projections provided by Fed policymakers in the\nSEP. The median interest rate observation for each year is designated by a black diamond.\nFigure 13 suggests that the median forecast is for increases in the federal funds rate that sum to\nroughly 1 percentage point (100 basis points) in each of the next two years. However, there are a\nnumber of participants that expect the rate to be below or above the median projection. I should\nnote that if rates did rise at the rate of the median projection, they would rise much more\ngradually than during the previous recovery.\nWhile the median forecast provides a reasonable estimate of the likely path of the federal\nfunds rate, my own view is that such a forecast does have downside risks. These downside risks\nreflect continued headwinds from weakness within countries that represent many of our major\ntrading partners, and only limited data to support the projected path of inflation to target seen in\nthe SEP, at least to date. Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that\ngrowth will be at or above potential, so that Federal Reserve policymakers can be confident that\ninflation will reach our 2 percent target.\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, the economy has reached an important milestone. The\nFederal Reserve raised short-term rates last month, reflecting the significant progress made by\nthe U.S. economy. Labor markets have tightened, and there is an expectation that we will begin\nto see the inflation rate move towards the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over the course of\n2016.\nThe initial increase in short-term rates was rather uneventful. The Federal Reserve’s\ntarget rate moved as expected, and the effective federal funds rate has largely traded within our\nband with the exception of a single day at year-end. Other short-term rates have moved as\nexpected, and there was little change in long-term rates.\nThe future path of the federal funds rate will be highly dependent on our evolving\noutlook, which will, of course, respond to the incoming economic data. My hope is that the\neconomy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate. Further increases in\nrates are in my view likely to be gradual. Importantly, I will remain highly attentive to foreign\neconomic conditions, any weakening of the domestic economic situation, and the path of U.S.\ninflation.\nThank you, and best wishes for a successful 2016.\n\n1\n\nFor example, those having less than a high school diploma.\n\n2\n\nBanks are required to hold bank reserves on transactions accounts, and banks with excess reserves would sell\nreserves to banks that were falling short of the reserves needed to meet their reserve requirement.\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 13, 2016 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n3\n\nAt first, in response to the events in the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve created liquidity programs that facilitated\ntransactions in markets where there were no buyers, in order to unfreeze financial markets that had become\nessentially paralyzed.\n4\n\nAnd although the federal funds rate target was essentially zero, other longer-term rates remained noticeably above\nzero.\n5\n\nThe Federal Reserve determines the total volume of reserves. Thus when the Federal Reserve expands its balance\nsheet, the banking system must hold these reserves.\n6\n\nThe Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying\ninterest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently\nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008. See\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm and\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2013/march/federal-reserve-interest-balances-reserves.\n7\n\nThis can be explained, in part, because a number of key entities with excess funds to lend cannot by law receive\ninterest on reserves. But there is likely a limit to how far below the IOER the federal funds rate can fall, as the\nincentive to park money in reserves rather than lend at the funds rate becomes large as the IOER rises significantly\nabove the funds rate.\n8\n\nBanks will not want to hold assets that don’t pay at least the interest rate on reserves, but other institutions that do\nnot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve (for example, money market funds) or do not receive interest on their\nreserves (for example, Fannie Mae) may lend funds at a rate somewhat below the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves.\nThus, the federal funds rate has traded below the rate of interest paid on reserves, because these non-bank firms are\nlending overnight funds at a rate slightly below the interest on reserves available to banks. If their rates fall too low,\nbanks could always arbitrage the market by providing funds to those market participants and holding the funds as\nexcess reserves, which would earn them the Fed’s rate of interest on reserves. However, because of regulatory\nrequirements, including capital requirements, banks will only do this arbitrage at a rate somewhat below the rate of\ninterest on reserves. In the absence of regulation, with costless arbitrage, everyone would receive the interest on\nreserves as the floor at which they were willing to lend.\n9\n\nThe reverse repurchase agreement is, in effect, a loan to the Federal Reserve collateralized by Treasury securities,\nin which the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities and agrees to buy them back the next day at a slightly higher\nprice. The difference between the sale price and repurchase price of the securities is essentially the interest earned\non the reverse repurchase agreement. It, in effect, provides a risk-free rate at which counterparties, including nonbanks, can invest their funds.\n10\n\nThe jump at year-end looks less unusual relative to the previous quarter-end (September 30, 2015) when term\nreverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) are also included. Aggregate overnight and term RRPs outstanding at the end\nof September totaled approximately $450 billion, only somewhat less than at year-end. Because overnight RRPs had\nno limits on usage, there was no demand for term reverse repurchase agreements at year-end.\n11\n\nMoving short-term rates represents the tool we have had the most experience with, and as a result there can be\nmore confidence in how it influences the economy.\n12\n\nThe tendency for core inflation to be lower than forecast could reflect the fact that the equilibrium unemployment\nrate is lower than my current estimate.\n\n15\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPresentation to the\nNewport County Chamber of Commerce\nPortsmouth, Rhode Island\nNovember 9, 2015\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“Assessing the Economy’s Progress”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPresentation to the Newport County Chamber of Commerce\nPortsmouth, Rhode Island\nNovember 9, 2015\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a great\npleasure to be in Newport County to talk about the economic outlook. In September, Rhode\nIsland had an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, only a bit above the national average. This\nrepresents a really remarkable improvement, given that the state was among the hardest hit\nduring the Great Recession – unemployment peaked at 11.3 percent in Rhode Island in mid2009. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among the states, Rhode Island had the\nlargest decline in the unemployment rate from September 2014, at 1.8 percentage points.1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nLooking regionally, in September two New England states – New Hampshire and\nVermont – had unemployment rates below 4 percent, and two other New England states –\nMassachusetts and Maine – had unemployment rates below 4.8 percent, which is my current\nestimate for the “full employment” level for the nation as a whole.\nThe employment report for October, released last Friday, held very good news.\nNationally, the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. In addition, payroll employment grew by\n271,000 jobs in October, and over the past three months payroll employment growth has\naveraged 187,000 jobs per month. Clearly, we are seeing continued improvement in labor\nmarkets and a further reduction in the remaining labor market slack.\nGiven the positive labor-market news – in Rhode Island, in New England, and nationally\n– it is reasonable to ask whether the degree of monetary stimulus being provided by the Federal\nReserve is still necessary. The question is especially relevant as many parts of the country return\nto pre-recession unemployment rates.\nAs I explore that question with you today, I would note as I always do that the views I\nwill express are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board\nof Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAt the September monetary policy meeting of the FOMC, the Committee chose not to\nraise short-term rates. In my view, that was a prudent decision, based on managing risks and\nconcerns. In the second half of August, problems in some emerging-market countries were\nunsettling global financial markets – and it was unclear what the duration of those difficulties\nwould be, and the likely extent of the spillover to more developed economies.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFortunately, the worst of those concerns have not materialized. Many stock markets have\nimproved from August, and more importantly, domestic spending in the U.S. does not seem to\nhave slowed significantly as a result of those earlier concerns; and firms are continuing to hire\nadditional workers.\nAfter the October monetary policy meeting, the FOMC statement2 noted that we are, of\ncourse, still monitoring global economic and financial developments. It went on to say that “it\nwill be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when [the Committee] has\nseen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will\nmove back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.” In more colloquial terms, I would\nsay if we see continued gradual improvement in the U.S. economy, it will be appropriate to\ngradually increase short-term rates.\nOctober’s statement explicitly mentioned the possibility that the first move could occur as\nsoon as the next meeting, in December, by saying: “In determining whether it will be appropriate\nto raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress – both realized\nand expected – toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.” I would\nhighlight that the data received recently have been positive, reflecting real improvement for the\neconomy.\nToday, I would like to review some of the current economic data and in doing so,\ndescribe why I am quite supportive of the position taken by the FOMC at the last meeting.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecent Economic Data\nMany headlines have focused on real GDP growing at only 1.5 percent in the third\nquarter. However, I would like to share with you a measure that focuses on domestic demand –\nreal final sales to domestic purchasers, which is shown in Figure 1. This statistic is similar to\nGDP, but excludes fluctuations in inventories and net exports. This leaves consumption,\ninvestment, and government spending – in sum, a measure that tries to capture the underlying\nstrength in domestic demand. In the third quarter of this year, real final sales to domestic\npurchasers grew by 2.9 percent, following its second-quarter growth of 3.7 percent.\nIn part, this indicator of more robust growth reflects the strength of consumer spending,\nshown in Figure 2. Consumer spending has been boosted by the continued gradual\nimprovement in labor markets, lower gasoline prices, and the relative strength in housing prices\nand stock prices, which have improved household net worth.\nImportantly, the strength in the third quarter in this measure of domestic demand suggests\nthat the U.S. was little affected by the problems in emerging markets, or by the resulting\nfinancial-market turbulence. With little collateral damage evident from external sources, I\nexpect domestic demand to continue to support the economy. This should help to offset any\npotential weakness of some of our trading partners and the strength of the dollar, which of course\nmakes it more difficult for U.S. exporters to compete internationally.\nAs long as domestic growth can offset any weakness in net exports, the economy should\ncontinue to grow somewhat above the level one would consider its “potential,” a growth rate that\nI estimate to be somewhat below 2 percent today. Growth above that rate should place downward\npressure on unemployment rates. Recent evidence confirms this assessment: despite real GDP\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ngrowth averaging only 2.1 percent since the beginning of the recovery, both the widely reported\nU-3 measure of unemployment and the broader U-6 measure of unemployment have fallen quite\nquickly, as shown in Figure 3 (the U-6 measure of unemployment adds persons marginally\nattached to the labor force, plus those part time for economic reasons).\nHow much further the unemployment rate can fall without risking a significant rise in\ninflation above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target depends on one’s estimate of the\nunemployment rate that is consistent with full employment. Figure 4 shows the Federal Reserve\npolicymakers’ Summary of Economic Projections – the “SEP” – forecast for the unemployment\nrate through 2018.3 The median among all policymakers’ projections is shown as the solid line,\nstarting at 5 percent and falling to 4.8 percent. In addition, the chart provides the estimates by\nFOMC participants of where longer-run unemployment is likely to be – which is a good proxy\nfor their estimates of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment.\nThe area between the dashed lines contains the range of estimates, which is fairly wide –\nfrom a low of 4.7 percent to a high of 5.8 percent. The central tendency (which excludes the\nhighest and lowest three estimates of longer-run unemployment) ranges from 4.9 to 5.2 percent,\nand is shaded. Given those numbers, the 5.0 percent unemployment rate for the U-3 measure is\nalready squarely within the Fed policymakers’ central tendency for longer-run unemployment.\nAt the Boston Fed, our estimate of unemployment in the long run is 4.8 percent. While that is\njust below the SEP central tendency, it is only 0.2 percent below the current rate.\nOnce we have reached the 2 percent inflation target and the natural rate of\nunemployment, we should have normalized interest rates. So one way the unemployment rate\nstops declining and levels off is if the Federal Reserve begins normalizing interest rates during\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe recovery, as the current extent of monetary accommodation becomes no longer necessary to\nreach the long-term goals.\nFigure 5 provides the real federal funds rate, measured as the federal funds rate minus\nthe inflation rate (with inflation measured by core PCE).4 The real rate is important for spending\nand investment decisions. The past three recessions are shaded.\nNot surprisingly, the Federal Reserve generally reduces short-term interest rates during a\nrecession and the early stages of a recovery. While the real federal funds rate did not become\nnegative during the 1990 recession, it did become negative just after the close of the 2001\nrecession. What is more unusual is how long the real federal funds rate has remained negative in\nthe aftermath of the most recent recession. After more than six years of recovery, the real federal\nfunds rate still remains negative, to a greater extent than in either of the previous two recessions.\nFigure 6 plots the real federal funds rate relative to the U-3 unemployment rate. The red\ndot highlights the October unemployment rate of 5.0 percent, and an October real federal funds\nrate of negative 1.2 percent. In addition, the chart separates – by color – observations from\nbefore monetary policy reached the zero lower bound (in December of 2008), and after. The\nbulk of negative real interest rate observations occur when the unemployment rate is quite high.\nMore generally, when the unemployment rate is as low as it is now, you normally see positive\nrather than negative real federal funds rates.\nFigure 7 shows the real federal funds rate relative to core PCE inflation. Again, the chart\nuses color to separate the observations from before and after monetary policy reached the zero\nlower bound. As the chart shows, the cluster of negative real interest rates reflects the period\nwhen monetary policy hit the zero lower bound. Since the nominal federal funds effective rate is\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nnear zero, the movement of the real interest rate once the zero lower bound was hit only reflects\nvariation in the core PCE inflation rate. While there are limited observations of the core PCE\ninflation rate being this low, there are observations of a higher real federal funds rate when\ninflation is approximately as low as it is currently. This highlights that monetary policy remains\nquite accommodative by historical standards, even while the PCE inflation rate remains low,\nrelative to our target.\nTo that end, Figure 8 shows several possible paths for short-term interest rates. One path\nillustrates what might occur if we were to increase the funds rate by 25 basis points at each\nFOMC meeting (as we did in the recovery from the 2001 recession) until the rate reaches the\nSEP longer-run projection. Another path depicts the Fed policymakers’ September SEP, and a\nthird path represents market expectations, implied by federal funds rate futures. The latter two\nboth would suggest that this is likely to be a much more gradual normalization process than the\none that followed the 2001 recession. Given persistently low wage and price pressures, and the\nrelatively slow real GDP growth forecast in the SEP shown in Figure 9, a more gradual path of\nnormalization may be necessary to ensure reaching the 2 percent inflation target.\nThere are other potential advantages to a gradual removal of accommodation. First, a\nslower path will provide more time to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening\ntools. Were the Committee to wait longer to begin, and then need to potentially move rates more\nrapidly, we might have less flexibility to assess the effectiveness of some of our new tools.\nA second benefit of a gradual removal of accommodation is that it would provide more\ntime to analyze how the tightening is affecting the real economy. Given that there is significant\nuncertainty about the level of interest rates that would stabilize inflation or unemployment – and\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nalso uncertainty about the federal funds rate that would reflect fully normalized policy – a slower\npace reduces the risk that the Committee takes more or less aggressive action than needed or\nintended.\nGiven the uncertainties surrounding the degree of accommodation that is necessary to\nachieve 2 percent inflation and full employment, I prefer a path that involves only gradual\nincreases in interest rates and that essentially probes how tight labor markets can be, consistent\nwith our 2 percent inflation target.\n\nFinancial Stability Considerations\nWhen the U.S. economy was significantly missing on the Federal Reserve’s employment\nand inflation goals, monetary policy was appropriately calibrated to provide considerable\nstimulus, so as to return the economy to its desired, normal state. However, as the economy\nattains a more desirable balance of full employment with 2 percent inflation, financial stability\nissues that imply risks to future economic balance should receive increased weight.\nOne potential cost of maintaining the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound for a long\ntime is that it may incent behavior that would be discouraged in a more normalized interest rate\nenvironment. Looking forward, a potential risk of a low-interest rate environment is that\ninvestors seeking a higher return may take on too much risk in order to improve returns, perhaps\nnot fully taking into account the higher risk that normally accompanies higher yields.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEarly signs of this “search for yield” may be showing up in the commercial real estate\nmarket. Figure 10 shows the path of commercial real estate prices, which have grown quite\nrapidly, despite the only modest growth in real GDP over the recovery.\nWhile Figure 10 reflects broad regional trends, in some more localized markets\ncommercial real estate activity has been even more robust. A qualitative indicator in a major city\nis a simple crane count. When the number of cranes observed on a short walk in a city such as\nBoston reaches double digits, as is the case today, it is worth reflecting on the sustainability of\nsuch growth. Particularly given the role that commercial real estate played in the economic\ndownturn in New England during the late 1980s, the trend in commercial real estate prices\nshould be thoughtfully monitored.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that labor markets have improved over the past\nyear, and we are at – or fast approaching – rates of unemployment that many economists\nestimate to be consistent with full employment. As long as the economy is growing somewhat\nabove potential, I am reasonably confident we will return to our 2 percent inflation target and to\nmy estimate of full employment.\nAs the October FOMC statement indicated, all future Committee meetings – including\nDecember’s – could be an appropriate time for raising rates, as long as the economy continues to\nimprove as expected. However, with inflation still below the target, I believe the path of\nincreases should be gradual, once we do move off the zero lower bound.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 9, 2015 at 12:40 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you today, and please accept my best wishes for\ncontinued growth and progress in the Rhode Island economy.\n\n1\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics: “Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia had statistically\nsignificant unemployment rate declines from September 2014, the largest of which occurred in Rhode Island (-1.8\npercentage points) and Michigan (-1.7 points). The only significant over-the-year rate increase was in West Virginia\n(+1.0 percentage point). The remaining 23 states had rates that were not appreciably different from those of a year\nearlier.” See: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\n2\n\nSee the October 28, 2015 FOMC statement:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151028a.htm\n3\n\nSee the September 17, 2015 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP):\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf\n4\n\nIn order to calculate the real federal funds rate for October, we assume that the core PCE inflation rate remains\nunchanged in October at 1.3%, on a year-over-year basis.\n\n10\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPresentation to the Forecasters Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 1, 2015\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a great time to\nbe speaking at the Forecasters Club of New York, as the path of monetary policy is importantly\ntied to policymakers’ forecasts for the economy and our confidence in those forecasts.\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my own,\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe July FOMC statementi provided two conditions related to when raising the target\nrange for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. First, the statement indicated the committee\nneeded to see “some further improvement in the labor market.” In my own view, this condition\nhas largely been met by the continued growth in payroll employment – averaging in excess of\n200,000 jobs per month, year-to-date through July, and a U-3 unemployment rate – the typical,\nwidely reported measure of unemployment – that is currently at 5.3 percent.\nThe second condition noted in the statement was that policymakers must be “reasonably\nconfident that [PCE] inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”\nFor this condition, the data have not been as clear-cut. Core PCE inflation for the past year has\nonly been 1.2 percent, and recently there have been substantial declines in oil prices and other\ncommodity prices. These will likely feed into core (and headline) measures of inflation for some\nmonths to come, temporarily lowering inflation readings. Adding to this, recent reports on\nwages and salaries still show few signs that the tightening labor markets are translating to\nincreases in wages and salaries consistent with reaching 2 percent inflation.\nAs a result, current data have yet to indicate that this second condition will be met in the\ncoming months; instead, policymakers will need to rely on forecasts of inflation. Unfortunately,\nover the past several years most forecasts have, incorrectly, predicted that inflation will return to\n2 percent – you might say the incoming data have not cooperated with the forecasts. A\ncombination of positive supply shocks, the presence of more labor market slack than is captured\nby U-3 unemployment readings, and weaker global conditions have no doubt contributed to these\nforecast errors. Nonetheless, one might still be somewhat confident that we will reach 2 percent\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nPCE inflation if one sees the U.S. economy as likely to continue growing above its potential,\nwhich would further improve labor market conditions.\nIn effect, then, my view of the forecast for higher inflation rests largely on whether I\nthink the economy will continue to experience growth above potential, and whether the\nsubsequent declining labor market slack will be sufficient to raise my confidence that inflation\nwill return to 2 percent in a reasonable time frame.\nSuch a forecast needs to be mindful of recent developments, including data that suggest\nthe slowing of foreign economies, coupled with volatile stock prices and falling commodity\nprices – both of which are consistent with a weaker global economy. In my view, these\ndevelopments might suggest a downward revision in the forecast that is large enough to raise\nconcerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely. And without an expectation\nof growth above potential and further tightening of labor markets, I would lose my primary\nrationale for a forecast of rising inflation, diminishing my confidence that inflation will reach the\n2 percent target within a reasonable time frame. Indications of a much weaker global economy\nwould at least increase the uncertainty surrounding policymakers’ economic growth and inflation\nforecasts.\nThe focus of my talk today will be less about the precise timing of an FOMC move on\ninterest rates, and more about the likely trajectory of monetary policy. While market attention\nhas focused on the exact timing of potential rate rises, macroeconomic models of the economy\noverwhelmingly suggest little impact on the broader economic landscape from moving the\ntiming of initial interest rate hikes forward or backward by a couple of months. However, the\nfuture trajectory of interest rate increases – that is, whether increases to more normalized levels\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\noccur quickly or more gradually – is, by contrast, likely to have a meaningful impact on\nemployment and inflation.\nToday I will argue that there are very good reasons to expect a much more gradual\nnormalization process than occurred in the previous two tightening cycles. Importantly, this is\nnot just my view; the Summary of Economic Projections – the “SEP” – released after the June\nFOMC meeting, which incorporates the federal funds rate expectations for all the FOMC\nparticipants assuming appropriate monetary policy, indicates that Federal Reserve policymakers\nexpect a gradual tightening cycle.ii My presentation today will, I believe, illustrate why this\nmore modest tightening path is both necessary and appropriate.\n\nRecent Tightening Cycles\nFigure 1 shows the effective federal funds rate over time, highlighting the six months\nbefore and after the initial commencement of a tightening cycle. In the past two cycles of\ntightening, the effective federal funds rate increased rapidly. Just prior to tightening, in January\n1994, for example, the federal funds rate was about 3 percent but one year later was 5.5 percent,\nan increase of almost 250 basis points in that time. In the most recent tightening cycle that began\nin June 2004, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of the next eight\nmeetings, thus totaling 200 basis points in the first year following the commencement of the\ntightening cycle. The figure also shows three dots to illustrate the expected path as indicated in\nthe June SEP.\nThis implied path of the SEP, illustrated more closely in Figure 2, is much slower than\nthe path taken in 2004, with the federal funds rate increasing at roughly half the pace of that\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntightening episode. This significantly slower pace reflects that lingering headwinds resonating\nfrom the financial crisis, and continued low inflation rates both here and abroad, likely require a\ndifferent path of tightening.\n\nThis Time is Different\nFigure 3 shows the inflation rate as measured by the core PCE index. At the beginning\nof the 1994 tightening cycle, core inflation was somewhat above 2 percent. At the initiation of\nthe 2004 tightening cycle, core PCE inflation was almost at 2 percent; shortly after the\ntightening, it averaged slightly above 2 percent. In contrast, we are currently well below the 2\npercent target, with the core PCE index having risen only 1.2 percent over the past year. While\nthe SEP indicates that core PCE inflation is expected to gradually rise to 2 percent, it is only\nslowly converging to this point, and similar forecasts made over the past two years have not been\nborne out by incoming data. Such a modest path to achieving the 2 percent inflation target in my\nview provides Fed policymakers the latitude to more gradually raise rates as we become more\nconfident that the trajectory of our inflation forecast is likely to be realized.\nFigure 4 shows the growth in real GDP, with shading around the commencement of\ntightening cycles. In the first quarter of 1994, when the tightening cycle was beginning, real\nGDP over the previous year averaged 3.4 percent. At the start of the 2004 tightening cycle, real\nGDP growth over the previous year was 4.2 percent. In contrast, over the past four quarters, real\nGDP has averaged only 2.7 percent. While it is true that potential growth has slowed recently,\nhow large and enduring this slowdown will prove to be is still unknown. Furthermore, real GDP\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngrowth as forecast in the SEP is likely to remain below 3 percent – slower than what was\nencountered in previous tightening cycles.\nFigure 5 highlights the unemployment rate, with shading around the beginning of the\ntightening cycles. In January 1994 (as well as in the first quarter of 1994 as a whole), the\nunemployment rate was 6.6 percent. In the second quarter of 2004 the unemployment rate was\n5.6 percent. Today, however, at 5.3 percent unemployment in July, we are well below the rate\nthat preceded the past two tightening cycles, although the SEP expects only a gradual\nconvergence in unemployment to 5 percent.\nSo, by the U-3 measure of unemployment, the commencement of tightening might on the\nsurface seem to be a bit late. However, as shown in Figure 6, using a broader definition of\nunemployment – known as the U-6 – which includes workers who are working part time for\neconomic reasons and workers who are marginally attached to the workforce, a somewhat\ndifferent picture emerges. In the first quarter of 1994, the U-6 rate was 11.5 percent; in the\nsecond quarter of 2004 it was only 9.6 percent. With the current U-6 unemployment rate of 10.7\npercent in the second quarter of 2015, and more recently 10.4 percent in July, we are between the\ntwo U-6 rates from the last two tightening episodes.\nOne interpretation of the data could be that the lack of inflation we are seeing to date may\nreflect that the degree of slack in the labor market is only imperfectly measured by U-3, which\nwould help account for the weak inflation and relatively modest increases we have seen in\nwages. If one believes the broader measure of unemployment better captures slack in the\neconomy, then labor markets would not be viewed as unusually tight for commencing the\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntightening cycle. This potential additional slack would also be a reason for policymakers to\nfollow a more modest interest rate path at the beginning of a tightening cycle.\n\nAnticipation of this Tightening Cycle\nFigure 7 shows the two-year Treasury rate, with the commencement of tightening\nhighlighted. Since most of the increase in the federal funds rate usually occurs in the first two\nyears of earlier tightening cycles, as the figure shows, then movement in the two-year rate should\ncapture the market’s anticipation of how quickly interest rates are likely to rise. In both 1994\nand 2004, for example, there was some modest increase in the two-year rate prior to the\ntightening, but substantially higher rates ensued once the first tightening had occurred.\nToday, with the periodic publication of the SEP and a greater emphasis on\ncommunication by the Federal Reserve, there has been significant marketplace discussion of the\nlikelihood of rates rising by the end of 2015. Not surprisingly, the two-year rate has increased\ngradually as the prospect of a tightening cycle has become more likely. A complicating factor is\nthe flight to quality that occurs with disturbances abroad; problems in Greece and China have\nprobably encouraged some movement into Treasury securities. However, the modest\nmovements to date seem consistent with investors expecting a gradual pace to the tightening.\nIn my own view, given current and forecast conditions, not only is the pace likely to be\ngradual, but the federal funds rate in the longer run may be lower than in previous tightening\ncycles. Figure 8 compares the federal funds rate three years after the first tightening in previous\ncycles to the federal funds rate in the longer run, according to the June SEP.iii The median SEP\nestimate of the federal funds rate in the longer run is 3.75 percent, well below the rates seen three\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nyears after the commencement of tightening in earlier tightening cycles. A much lower endpoint\nand a gradual tightening path are, in fact, consistent with the only modest increase in the twoyear rate to date.\nThe results of July’s Survey of Primary Dealersiv offer another indication that many\nmarket participants believe this will be a more gradual tightening cycle. Figure 9 shows the\nmidpoint estimates of the primary dealer survey for the federal funds range compared with the\nestimates provided by FOMC participants in the SEP. The primary dealer responses show that\ntheir forecast for the path of the federal funds rate is not significantly different than what was\nprovided by FOMC participants in the June SEP – both expect that the tightening path this time\nwill be gradual and is likely to stop at a lower rate than in previous cycles.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, this period of tightening is likely to differ from the two\nprevious tightening cycles in that inflation is low and real GDP growth is slower than in 1994\nand 2004, respectively. While U-3 unemployment is lower now than at the outset of these earlier\ntightening cycles, the broader measure – U-6 unemployment – is not particularly low compared\nto the start of the prior two cycles.\nThe results of the primary dealer survey and the most recent SEP provide further\nevidence that this cycle of tightening is expected to be more gradual and stop at a lower federal\nfunds rate.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 1, 2015 at 1:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe more gradual tightening cycle should enable monetary policymakers to gauge how\ntight labor markets can be while maintaining stable prices. The very low inflation rates here and\nabroad make it a particularly good time to not be too tied to imprecise measures of full\nemployment.\nOf course, given the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased\nuncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary policymakers to\nclosely monitor and depend on incoming data.\nThank you.\n\ni\n\nSee the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm.\n\nii\n\nSee the June SEP material at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf\n\niii\n\nFor historical context, the longer-run federal funds rate could be measured by the average over a long time period,\nsuch as from the first quarter of 1992 to the third quarter of 2008 – 4 percent – or from the first quarter of 1985 to\nthe third quarter of 2008 – 5 percent.\niv\n\nThe New York Fed’s Markets Group surveys primary dealers on their expectations for the economy, monetary\npolicy, and financial market developments prior to Federal Open Market Committee meetings.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nKeynote Remarks at the Global Interdependence\nCenter’s Seventh Annual Rocky Mountain\nEconomic Summit\nVictor, Idaho\nJuly 10, 2015\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. I look\nforward to the exchange of views and analysis that are hallmarks of these gatherings.\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs the U.S. economy approaches conditions that are consistent with beginning the\nprocess of normalizing monetary policy, it is not surprising that financial market\nparticipants would prefer simple and unqualified statements about the future path of\nmonetary policy. However, appropriate policy necessarily depends on our forecast of the\neconomy’s path in coming months, and that path is always somewhat uncertain. Events\nthat are unfolding of late exemplify the difficulties often faced in making economic\nforecasts. These events and uncertainties also reinforce the prudence of adhering to the\nnotion of “data dependence” in making monetary policy decisions.\nOne significant area of uncertainty in the current forecast centers on inflation:\nwhy have we not yet seen inflation clearly returning to the 2 percent target?1 The Federal\nReserve policymakers’ forecasts in the June Summary of Economic Projections2 – the\n“SEP” – predict that core inflation will return to 2 percent, but that has been the case for\nearlier SEP forecasts as well and, as yet, the data on core inflation have remained\nsurprisingly weak, even as labor markets have improved. In addition, recent international\nevents highlight that the future path of energy prices and the dollar remain quite\nuncertain.\nA second area of uncertainty stems from events – often difficult to predict –\nwhich domestic monetary policy cannot influence. The unfolding events in Greece\nprovide an obvious current example. The emergence in recent weeks of questions about\nwhether Greece and its creditors can reach a viable agreement complicates projections\nabout how economic conditions are likely to unfold over the course of the summer and\nbeyond.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nTo be clear, while these negative developments have been intensely painful for\nthe Greek people, to date it is not obvious that these events will significantly alter the\nexpected path of the U.S. economy. But they have surely added to the uncertainty\naround that forecast. I will offer my own perspective on that situation in a few moments.\nWere the U.S. economy to unfold as I and other policymakers expected in our\nJune SEP forecasts, beginning the policy normalization process later this year might be\nappropriate. However, the assumption that our current forecasts for labor markets and for\ninflation will unfold as expected is still subject to considerable uncertainty, a topic to\nwhich I will now turn.\n\nDomestic Uncertainty\nThe evolution of the domestic economy remains somewhat concerning. Perhaps\nmost troubling is the fact that inflation persists in remaining well below the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target. Inflation rates that are too low limit monetary policy’s ability\nto offset the disturbances that often buffet an economy. Hence, one of the conditions that\nthe FOMC stipulated for beginning to raise short-term rates is that the Committee should\nbe reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term.3 Notably, the undershooting of inflation targets has been a problem in\nmany developed countries, with Japan and Europe significantly undershooting their\ntargets as well.\nFigure 1 shows how the forecasts of inflation by FOMC participants have fallen\nover the last three years. The figure provides predictions, made at various times, of core\nPCE inflation for the fourth quarter of 2015. What you see is the so-called central\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntendency of those forecasts, which excludes the three highest and the three lowest\nforecasts. In late 2012 and early 2013, the forecasts for inflation in 2015 were closely\nbunched around our 2 percent inflation target. However, as time has progressed, the SEP\nforecasts have reflected increasing pessimism that we will reach the 2 percent inflation\ngoal in 2015. Over the last year, core PCE inflation has been only 1.2 percent, and the\nJune SEP forecasts for inflation in the fourth quarter of this year had a central tendency of\njust 1.3 to 1.4 percent.\nOne reason the inflation rate may be so subdued is that significant slack – that is,\nexcess supply – may remain in the labor market despite the simplest and most widelyreported unemployment rate having fallen to 5.3 percent. An example of potential slack\nin the labor market appears in Figure 2, which shows a steep drop in the percent of the\npopulation in the U.S. that is employed. This employment-to-population ratio declined\nsignificantly during the last recession and has only marginally improved during the\nrecovery.\nHowever, some of this decline is the result of a significant demographic change\noccurring in the workforce. Failure to take this demographic change into account would\nresult in an overestimation of the potential slack in the labor market. A close\nexamination of Figure 3 shows just how dramatic the age-related demographic shift has\nbeen in the population over the last two decades. By 2014, the percentage of the\npopulation in the three younger age groups had fallen relative to 1994, while the\npercentage of the population in the three older age groups had risen. This demographic\nshift is slightly offset by the fact that more older Americans are participating in the labor\nforce than has historically been the case.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAn interesting implication of this demographic shift is that the unemployment rate\nshould perhaps be lower at so-called “full employment.” Younger workers tend to have\nhigher unemployment rates, since they are only beginning to acquire the skills needed by\nemployers. Older workers tend to have very low unemployment rates if they remain in\nthe workforce. As a result, the estimates of the unemployment rate at full employment\nneed to consider whether changes in the demographic composition of the workforce have\nan impact.\nThis is one reason why I personally have lowered my estimate of the natural rate\nof unemployment to 5 percent, and I believe it may need to be adjusted even lower if\ninflation continues to undershoot our forecasts.\nFigure 4 shows the employment-to-population ratio for three of the prime-age\nworking cohorts.4 Since it is looking at narrow fixed-age groupings, its movement will\nnot be as affected by demographic changes as would the overall employment-topopulation ratio. All three age cohorts declined significantly during the recession, and\nhave partially recovered over the past several years. However, they also highlight that in\neach of the age cohorts, the employment-to-population ratio remains well below levels\nseen in the decade prior to the recession. Even if we do not fully return to the\nemployment-to-population ratios seen in the decade before the recession, we could still\nhave significant labor market slack to address.\n\nUncertainty Related to Possible International Shocks\nI would also like to provide some perspectives this morning on international\nshocks. Given the many pressure points around the world – Greece’s debt crisis, China’s\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nslowing economy, Japan’s long-running economic challenges, and areas of geopolitical\ninstability and conflict – we all recognize that a number of international disruptions to the\ndomestic economy are at least possible.\nLet me say that I am currently making the assumption that international matters\nwill be resolved in a way that does not meaningfully alter the course of the U.S. domestic\neconomy. However, I will also highlight the situation in Greece as an example of how\ndifficult-to-predict international events can make forecasting the future course of the\neconomy challenging. The situation also calls for some sober reflecting on how best to\npreserve financial stability in all parties’ interests – and to that end I will provide a few of\nmy own perspectives in a moment.\nRecent events in Greece have underlined the fact that the Greek people are\nenduring a very difficult era. Figure 5 shows that the unemployment rate in Greece has\nrisen dramatically over the past several years, and was over 25 percent this spring, prior\nto the turmoil of the last few weeks. And unfortunately the modest decline in the Greek\nunemployment rate is not really a particularly positive development, since it partly\nreflects reductions in labor force participation as Greek workers have given up on looking\nfor work in their highly depressed labor market.\nSome analysts and observers suggest that any problems in Greece are unlikely to\nhave a broader impact simply because of Greece’s relatively small size. To that end,\nFigure 6 provides some summary statistics. Greece is indeed a small country. With a\npopulation of 11 million people, it is small relative to the 334 million people in the Euro\nArea or the 507 million people in the European Union. Because per capita GDP in\nGreece is lower than in many European countries, Greek GDP is less than 2 percent of\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe GDP of the Euro Area or the European Union. For an American frame of reference,\nGreece has about the same population as Ohio, and the GDP of Connecticut.\nAs a general principal I would say that such measures can be a bit misleading\nwhen one is calibrating financial stability risks.5 The absolute size of an exposure may be\nless important than whether that exposure is diffusely held or is concentrated with\nparticular investors. Generally speaking, disruption can be amplified when investors are\nhighly leveraged, and when they play a critical role in financial markets functioning\nsmoothly.\nAt this point, much of the exposure to Greek assets has already been transferred\nfrom European banks to the European public sector. In 2011, a key risk was that\ncommercial banks that were important for the stability and functioning of the financial\nsystem held highly leveraged exposures to Greece. Factually speaking, that particular\nfinancial stability risk is diminished today, as the earlier restructuring of Greek debt\nmeans that many of the losses would be borne diffusely by European taxpayers. And as\nyou can see in Figure 7, the spread of peripheral countries’ 10-year bonds over German\nbonds has been significantly less volatile recently, compared with 2011 – perhaps\nreflecting the diminution of that risk.\nFigure 8 shows the movement of stock prices in various countries following the\nannouncement of the Greek referendum after the close of stock markets on Friday, June\n26. On Monday, June 29 there was a sizable impact (even though the referendum, as\nannounced, would not decide the matter of Greece’s future participation in the Euro\nArea). The decline in stock prices of about 2 percent in the United States, and more than\nthat in other countries, suggests the importance that market participants place on events in\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nGreece even given its small size. Of course, we do have the caveat that the declines\nreflect other “news” events that may have occurred during that same time period.\nTo date, the impact of the situation in Greece has been modest outside of Greece\nitself. However, the financial market movements that I have highlighted suggest that, in\na world with integrated financial markets, even modest disruptions that seem small\nrelative to the global economy have the potential to be enhanced. This argues for\nthoughtful, proactive work to try to prevent or manage such disruptions.\n\nPotential for Unintended Consequences\nEvents in Europe are obviously very fluid, but as a longtime observer of financial\nstability issues and their impact on economic participants, I will offer my perspective. I\nwould underline the desirability of Greece and its creditors finding a reasonable\ncompromise, which would not only help Greece but would avoid some unintended\nconsequences for all parties in the Euro Area.\nThe Euro Area had been assumed to be a permanent currency union with no\nprospect of or procedure for countries leaving to reinstate their previous national\ncurrencies. If that assumption eroded and it were to become understood, instead, that\ncountries could leave the Euro Area, some of the advantages of the common currency for\nall the members would be diminished. Allow me to give some examples.\nOne advantage of a common currency is that it eliminates exchange-rate risk. As\na result, transactions anywhere in the common currency area can be conducted without\nconcern that the relative currency valuation will change, eliminating the need for firms to\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhedge their exchange rate risk. However, if a country were to exit the euro, firms would\nnot be hedged for counterparties in that country.6\nIn essence, the common currency makes it difficult to completely hedge the “tail”\nrisk (meaning a small likelihood, large impact event) of a country leaving the euro, and\nthis applies not just to Greece. The emergence of this new dynamic might encourage\nfirms and financial institutions to reduce their exposure to counterparties in some\ncountries, or to match their assets and liabilities by country. All this would mean that\nsome of the advantages of a common currency would be lost for all parties in the\ncurrency union.\nA second advantage of a common currency relates to inflation discipline. Several\nof the countries in the Euro Area did not have success controlling inflation prior to\njoining the euro. However, exiting the union would imply a risk of a sharp reduction in\nthe value of currency – essentially a large inflationary effect. So any country with a risk\nof exit may have the potential tail risk of much higher inflation (upon exit), and this\nmight discourage some firms from locating in such countries, despite the other\nadvantages.\nA third advantage of a common currency is that capital can flow to the highest\nreturn projects, regardless of national borders. However, if exit becomes perceived as\npossible, the prospect of capital controls in countries with exit potential could discourage\ninvestment. Similarly, capital flows would be unlikely to move as freely if there is a tail\nrisk of a large currency devaluation.\nThese are just three examples underlining the fact that exit could have some\nlonger-term implications not only for Greece, but also potentially for other countries in\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe Euro Area. Obviously the situation remains fluid and the next few weeks will be\nimportant. I raise these issues in the spirit of encouraging a prudent, proactive\nunderstanding and management of risks, and as clear an eye as possible to potential\nunintended consequences.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I will first state the obvious: economic forecasting is\nimportant for setting appropriate monetary policy. Today, I have emphasized two areas\nof significant uncertainty in such forecasting.\nDespite persistent improvement, the U.S. economy continues to undershoot the\nFederal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. As the economy continues to improve, I\nexpect that inflation will begin to move closer to that target, making it appropriate to\nconsider starting to normalize monetary policy later this year. However, as we near our\ndual mandate goals, monetary policymaking needs to be particularly data dependent. As\nI have emphasized today, data dependence at this point means, in my view, that we wait\nfor data that gives us greater confidence in our forecast, especially our forecast for\ninflation. And it also means we wait to get a better handle on how the crisis in Greece\ngets resolved, so that we can better gauge its potential to impact financial markets and the\ndomestic economy.\nObviously, my hope is that both of these key risks will resolve in a way that\nsupports the Committee’s normalization criteria. Fortunately, to date, geopolitical issues\nand concerns around the world have not significantly altered the outlook for an\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL July 10, 2015 at 11:35 A.M. Eastern Time (9:35 A.M. Local Time in Victor, Idaho) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nimproving U.S. economy. Thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I\nlook forward to the rest of today’s program.\n\n1\n\nThe FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy states: “The inflation rate\nover the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to\nspecify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2\npercent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is\nmost consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf\n2\n\nSee the June SEP at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150617.pdf\n\n3\n\nSee the statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150617a.htm\n\n4\n\nWhile looking at the employment-to-population ratio for narrow age groups significantly reduces the\neffects of demographic changes, another way to remove the effects of demographics changes on the\nemployment-to-population ratio and to better assess its recovery from the most recent recession is to hold\nthe age mix of the population constant. This exercise – holding the age mix of the population constant as\nof 2004 – shows that some of the lack of recovery in the employment-to-population ratio can be attributed\nto the aging of the population. With a constant age mix, the employment-to-population ratio falls by almost\nan equal amount but recovers more rapidly and would be roughly two percentage points higher as of June,\nbut still well below its previous peak.\n5\n\nFor example, many analysts cited the small size of sub-prime mortgages relative to the size of the U.S.\neconomy in making the argument that their loss in value would have a minimal impact. This perspective\nwas certainly not borne out by events in the United States in 2007 and 2008.\n6\n\nIn the case of Greece, no financial exchange would be immediately available to completely hedge the\npotential new-drachma exchange-rate risk.\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nCapital Workforce Partners\n“Workforce Stars” Event\nHartford, Connecticut\nJune 1, 2015\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be invited to address you today, and to take part\nin this event honoring individuals and organizations that contribute to the health of the\nregional workforce.\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWith the wonderful New England summer weather now upon us, it may seem\nunnecessary – and perhaps a bit cruel – to dredge up memories of the brutal winter we\nexperienced here in the Northeast. However, economics has been called the dismal\nscience.\nBut I have a substantive reason for pondering the winter we just endured.\nBecause economic data emerge with lags, recent disappointing numbers have generated a\nspirited debate about whether the weak performance can be explained by temporary\nfactors, such as the brutal weather we experienced during the first quarter. In many parts\nof New England, record snowfall prevented people from getting to work, shoppers from\ngetting to stores, and customers from going out to eat. So clearly, bad weather did deter\nsome economic activity.\nHowever, the data were not just weak during the worst of winter; they were also\nweak before the storms and have been weaker than expected ever since. So economic\ngrowth for the first half of this year looks to be well below what was expected, even\ncorrecting for some temporary disruptions.\nOf course, this weaker growth has implications for monetary policy. In the last\ntwo monetary policy statements issued by the FOMC, the Committee’s criteria for raising\nshort-term rates were twofold – first, further improvement in the labor market, and\nsecond, being reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target.\nSuch conditions are likely to be met in the near term only if the economy grows above\nthe rate economists refer to as its “potential.” Given the data that we have seen so far,\neconomic growth above potential seems unlikely for the first half of this year.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nDespite a disappointing first half, most forecasters expect a stronger second half\nof the year. Among the factors supporting this optimism are growth in personal income,\nthe positive impact of lower gas prices, and household net worth that continues to grow.\nHowever, so far this improvement is only in the forecast, and not in the data. The data\nhave disappointed before, and an appropriately data-dependent monetary policy requires\nconfirmation in the numbers, not just in forecasts of better times.\nToday I would like to provide an overview of recent data, which in my view\ndemonstrate why the conditions for beginning the tightening of monetary policy have not\nyet been met.\nThis view is heightened, I would argue, by global political, security, and financial\nconditions that suggest the risks of a negative shock from abroad remain elevated, as has\nbeen the case over the last several years. With short-term interest rates near zero,\nmonetary policy would have limited ability to offset such a shock. If we were fortunate\nenough to see the economy grow much more quickly, we would have the ability to raise\nrates more quickly. But the near-term constraint on offsetting a shock amounts to an\n“asymmetric” situation that, in my view, needs to be taken into account in formulating an\nappropriate policy stance.\n\nRecent Economic Growth\nFigure 1 shows the private-sector forecasts for real GDP growth as of last\nNovember. It provides the median forecast of quarterly real GDP growth in the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, and the\naverage forecast of quarterly real GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey. While there is\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsome overlap among the participants in the two surveys, both surveys forecast relatively\nstrong real GDP growth from the fourth quarter of 2014 through 2015.\nHowever, the figure shows that actual growth has been well below forecasted\ngrowth. Real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2014 grew at 2.2 percent, and declined 0.7\npercent in the first quarter of 2015. My expectation is that second quarter growth is\nlikely to be only 2 percent. Taken together, this means that over the past three quarters,\nreal GDP growth has been disappointing. If such a pace of growth persists, it is unlikely\nto be associated with further significant declines in the unemployment rate.\nFigure 2 shows the probability assessments for different real GDP growth rates\nfor 2015 submitted by forecasters participating in the Survey of Professional Forecasters\nin February and in May. The distributions show forecasters were more confident about\nthe probability of stronger 2015 real GDP growth in 2015 in February than in May. Thus,\nbased on the weaker incoming economic data, a noticeable leftward shift in the\nprobability distribution occurred between February and May.\nTogether, Figures 1 and 2 show that forecasts have tended to be too optimistic\nabout growth in 2015, and that their assessment of the likelihood of strong growth over\nthe year has declined significantly as the year has progressed.\nFigure 3 shows that there was indeed unusual weather in many parts of the\ncountry in the first quarter. In the East, the weather was unusually cold. This would\npresumably discourage shopping, housing starts, and other types of economic activity\nwhere adverse weather could deter outdoor activity. However, the chart also shows that\nwhile the East had record cold, the West had record warmth. Warmer than normal\nwinters in the West might not be much of a deterrent to economic activity in the short\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nterm1 unless you were hoping to ski (although New England provided ample\nopportunities for that).\nEven though most of the unusual weather occurred in February, the higherfrequency economic data suggest slowness both before and after February. While it is\ndifficult to assess the exact effect of weather on first-quarter data, if there was a\ntemporary deferral of economic activity due to bad weather, one should expect a\nsnapback as the weather improves. But there has not been much evidence of such a\nsnapback in the numbers.\nFigure 4 provides the quarterly pattern of real GDP growth over the previous five\nyears. The dotted lines pinpoint the growth rate that occurred in the first quarter of each\nof these years. Some economists have questioned whether the normal seasonal\nadjustments are appropriately capturing seasonal variations in economic activity, since\nfirst-quarter growth has tended to be lower than other quarters recently. If inappropriate\nseasonal adjustment accounts for a significant portion of weak measured growth in the\nfirst quarter, this too would suggest a snapback in the subsequent quarter (and reasonable\ngrowth on average across the two quarters). But the data for the second quarter do not\nyet indicate much of a snapback, with many current-quarter forecasts of GDP close to 2\npercent growth.\nFigure 5 provides the growth rate of real GDP leading up to the first tightening of\nmonetary policy in previous cycles. The table shows that in each of the previous\ntightening cycles, real GDP growth in the two years preceding the tightening was above 3\npercent. It should not be surprising that the first tightening of policy occurred during\nperiods of relatively strong growth. However, today we are faced with a growth rate of\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n2.3 percent over the past two years, and the strong possibility that growth in the first half\nof this year will average much less than 2 percent. In my view, such a pace of GDP\ngrowth does not meet some of the economic preconditions we look for when we begin a\ntightening cycle, even if one takes into account that potential GDP growth is now lower\nthan in previous cycles.\n\nThe Role of Consumption\nMost forecasters have expected relatively robust growth in consumption.\nBecause consumption is such a large component of GDP, stronger growth in\nconsumption can offset weaker growth in many of the smaller components of GDP.\nFigure 6 shows that seasonally adjusted consumption at the end of last year was quite\nstrong, while in the first quarter of this year it was disappointing. If first-quarter\nweakness was really due to temporary factors, we would expect a rebound in the second\nquarter as these factors waned. The weak retail sales numbers for April, however, signal\nthat we need to see more data before dismissing the slower first-quarter consumption as\nonly a result of temporary factors.\nFigure 7 provides an estimate of retail sales based on a survey that breaks out\nresults by geographic region of the country. Given the weather map shown in Figure 3,\none might expect sharp variations across regions of the country. However, the regional\npatterns are quite similar, making the weather a less plausible explanation for most of the\nweakness in the first quarter.\nAn alternative explanation – versus temporary factors such as severe weather\nimpacting recent data – could be simply that many consumers remain reluctant to spend\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndespite the time that has passed since the Great Recession. Figure 8 shows that the\npersonal saving rate has remained well above where it was prior to the Great Recession.2\nIf consumer behavior is still being impacted by the experience of the financial\ncrisis, the Great Recession, and the painfully slow recovery, then it is possible that the\neconomy will not be as robust as many economic models would suggest, because the\nmodels do not take into account this behavioral change. As Figure 9 illustrates, many of\nthe factors that drive consumption in most economic models have been increasingly\nfavorable. The strength of these consumption fundamentals likely explains why many\nforecasters continue to expect reasonably strong consumption and growth in the second\nhalf of this year.\n\nAchieving the Fed’s Mandate\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress that is focused on stable\nprices and maximum sustainable employment. Let me now turn to inflation and\nemployment in more detail.\nFigure 10 illustrates that neither the “total” nor the “core” measures of PCE\ninflation are yet showing much evidence of returning to the 2 percent inflation target that\nthe Fed considers ideal. If the economy were growing quickly, there might be greater\nconfidence that the resulting tightening of labor markets would boost wages, and\nultimately prices, such that the 2 percent target level of inflation would be reached over\nthe next two years. However, if growth remains slow, confidence in the likelihood of\nachieving the 2 percent inflation target in the next two years would be diminished.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 11 shows longer-run forecasts of the unemployment rate from the\nSummary of Economic Projections made by Federal Reserve policymakers over the past\nyear, including the most recent as of the March FOMC meeting.3 At 5.4 percent,\nunemployment is currently below some FOMC participants’ estimate of “full”\nemployment. However, in the absence of inflationary pressures, estimates of full\nemployment among many FOMC participants have been trending down. At this point,\nthe median estimate of full employment among FOMC participants – as reflected in their\nlonger-run unemployment rate projections – is 5.05 percent.4 Still, a declining\nunemployment rate coupled with weak GDP growth could signal that the level of the\nunemployment rate consistent with full employment is drifting even lower.\nFigure 12 provides the range and median of inflation forecasts for the next three\nyears as of the March FOMC meeting. Many FOMC participants forecast that inflation\nwill only gradually reach the 2 percent inflation target.\nFigure 13 shows that at the March FOMC meeting, many participants viewed the\nmost likely path of the federal funds rate to be a tightening that is gradual by historical\nstandards.5 Obviously, the data coming in since that meeting may result in revisions to\nthat path after the June FOMC meeting.\nAs the federal funds rate target is raised, it is likely to also be reflected in longerterm rates, such as the 10-year rate. But as Figure 14 shows, the historical relationship\nbetween the 10-year Treasury rate and the effective federal funds rate has been quite\nvariable. On average, the spread has been roughly 150 basis points. But the figure\nhighlights that it is certainly possible that the spread between the funds rate and longerterm rates could be much larger than it has been of late.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL June 1, 2015 at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, the economy has been softer in the first half of this\nyear than many forecasters expected. It is too soon to know whether this is driven\nprimarily by temporary factors like the severe winter, or is a reflection of broader\nchanges in the economy.\nFor monetary policy to begin the normalization process, I believe we need to be\nconfident that we will return to full employment and 2 percent inflation over the next\ncouple of years. If the economy continues to grow at the same pace as we witnessed on\naverage in the current and the past two quarters, I do not expect to see timely\nimprovements in the unemployment rate and sufficient progress towards the 2 percent\ninflation target. This, in my view, makes a compelling argument for continued patience\nin monetary policy.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nObviously, warmer winters can have longer-run negative impacts on economic activity, given that they\nmay exacerbate drought conditions.\n2\n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the saving rate may have been unusually low and has now perhaps returned to\na more normal level.\n3\n\nEconomic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, March\n2015: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf\n4\n\nIn Figures 11 and 12, what is referred to as the median is the midpoint of the median range reported in the\nminutes for the FOMC meetings.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nChatham House\nLondon, England\nApril 16, 2015\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be here at Chatham House to discuss the economic\noutlook. Because of the strong economic ties across the Atlantic, it is important to\nmaintain a good dialogue centering on the common challenges we all face – and what\nthose challenges imply for our respective monetary policies.\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn March, the FOMC’s monetary policy statement1 provided two conditions for\nraising short-term interest rates in the United States. First, the statement indicated that\nthe Committee needs to see “further improvement in the labor market.” Second, the\nCommittee needs to be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2\npercent objective over the medium term.”\nTo the first condition, the recent U.S. employment report was disappointing. In\nMarch, the U.S. economy created only 126,000 net new jobs, and the unemployment rate\nwas unchanged at 5.5 percent. To the second, core PCE inflation in the United States is\n1.4 percent2 with no clear indication of when it will return to the Federal Reserve’s stated\ninflation target of 2 percent.\nHence, at this time, I do not think that either condition has been met. Although\nthere has been noticeable improvement in the labor market over the past few years, since\nMarch the indicators have been a bit mixed. Furthermore, inflation remains stubbornly\nbelow our target of 2 percent.\nWith sufficiently strong economic growth, improvements in labor markets and\nincreases in inflation would likely follow. But first quarter real GDP growth in the U.S.\nappears to have slowed to well below the relatively disappointing fourth quarter growth\nof only 2.2 percent. The unusually cold and snowy winter (which I can surely attest to,\nliving in the Boston area, which this year saw over 110 inches of snow) may have been a\ntemporary slowing factor. Still, it remains difficult to separate the temporary and easyto-explain from the lasting and more concerning – so in my view, incoming data would\nneed to improve to fully satisfy the Committee’s two conditions for starting to raise rates.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAlong with the two conditions described in the statement, the Committee also\npublished its latest forecasts. Each quarter, the FOMC provides information on the\nindividual forecasts of the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents,\nbrought together in a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).3 Not surprisingly, many\nobservers tend, it seems, to focus on the interest rate projections from each of the FOMC\nparticipants. Yet, I would suggest that there is important additional information in the\nSEP that tends not to receive the same emphasis.\nToday I would like to focus on two aspects of the recent Summary of Economic\nProjections – two aspects that probably deserved to attract more public discussion than it\nseems they did. The first matter is the recent striking reduction in the estimates of the\nunemployment rate that FOMC participants expect to see in the longer run. The second\nis the reduction in the level of the federal funds rate that participants expect to see in the\nlonger run. Both variables are important, obviously, to FOMC participants as we\ndetermine both the timing of the first tightening of this monetary policy cycle, and how\nmuch and how quickly the Committee should continue to tighten after the first increase.\nI would add that in addition to being relevant for current monetary policy\ndecision-making, these measures are also relevant to the discussion of how best to utilize\nsimple monetary policy rules, a topic discussed by members of Congress and Chair\nYellen at recent Congressional hearings. These two variables – longer-run expectations\nfor unemployment and the federal funds rate – are normally assumed to be constant in\nsimple rules such as those proposed by Professor John Taylor.4 But in practice, these key\nvariables, held constant by simple rules of thumb, can change – and, according to FOMC\nparticipants’ SEP submissions, have changed significantly over the past three years.5 The\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nvariability of these two key estimates highlights just one of the many perils of using\nsimple rules to constrain monetary policymaking.6\n\nThe Fed’s Dual Mandate\nIn the United States, the central bank has a Congressionally assigned dual\nmandate to achieve maximum sustainable employment and stable prices. In practice, the\ndual mandate involves maintaining full employment and hitting the inflation target.\nThese two goals are affirmed each year in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy.7 The inflation goal is quite explicit – a 2 percent\nannualized rate of inflation, as measured by the PCE price index. Full employment, by\ncontrast, has a more ambiguous target. As the statement on monetary goals says, “The\nmaximum level of employment is largely determined by non-monetary factors that affect\nthe structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and\nmay not be directly measurable.”\nIn practice, this means that the Committee has to make an assessment about the\nlevel of unemployment that would be consistent with a stable inflation rate in the longer\nrun – the level of unemployment below which competition for labor bids up wage\nincreases, leading to higher price inflation. Views on the level of unemployment\nconsistent with full employment certainly differ among economists and policymakers –\nand with good reason, given the difficulties in estimating an unobservable quantity that\nnonetheless appears to have changed significantly over time.\nFigure 1 shows how the Committee’s views on unemployment in the longer run\nhave changed over the past three years. The dark blue line provides the midpoint of the\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nestimates of the participants at the policy meeting. The shaded area provides the range of\nthe central tendency, which excludes the three highest and three lowest estimates of the\nlonger-run unemployment rate. Starting in June of 2012, the midpoint was 5.6 percent,\nwith a quite large range of 5.2 to 6.0 percent. Had participants with estimates at the top\nof the range not subsequently changed their estimates of unemployment in the longer run,\nthe U.S. unemployment rate would currently be one-half percentage point below their\nestimates of full employment.\nOver the past five quarters, the upper end of the central tendency declined\nsignificantly. As of the March FOMC meeting, the top of the range was 5.2 percent –\nand notably, 5.2 percent was the bottom of the central tendency until recently. In\naddition, the spread has narrowed significantly, with the central tendency now lying\nbetween 5.0 and 5.2 percent. My own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate is\n5.0 percent, at the bottom of the central tendency. I, too, have changed my estimate over\nthe past three years – from 5.25 percent at the beginning of the period to 5.0 percent now.\nA number of factors may be behind the lower estimates for the unemployment\nrate in both the medium and the longer run.\nLooking first at the medium run, one possibility is that the standard\nunemployment rate usually quoted – the “U-3” measure – may not fully capture the\ncurrent slack in the labor market. As Figure 2 shows, the share of workers whose status\nis “part time for economic reasons” has declined over the recovery but still remains quite\nelevated by historical standards. These are people who would prefer full-time work, and\nare likely to continue to seek and find full-time employment as the economy improves.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, since they are viewed as “employed” in the U-3 measure, they are not counted\nas part of the unemployment rate.\nTurning to the longer run, a reason FOMC participants may have lowered their\nestimates of the longer-run unemployment rate is the absence of significant wage and\nprice pressures, despite the unemployment rate falling to 5.5 percent. Figure 3 shows the\ncore PCE rate of inflation. The core rate of inflation has yet to return to 2 percent, and in\nfact has been below 2 percent for most of the period since the recession. Figure 4 shows\nthat growth in wages and salaries has remained relatively subdued across occupations\nsince the recession. Wages and salaries are also well below the growth rate seen prior to\nthe recession. The disaggregation by occupational groups also shows that broad\noccupational categories are not yet hitting significant bottlenecks. The absence of wage\nand price pressure is consistent with some slack still remaining in the labor markets, even\nwith an unemployment rate that has fallen to 5.5 percent.\nIt is also possible that demographics have been underappreciated and play some\nrole in the decline in the level of the unemployment rate consistent with negligible\ninflation pressure. For example, Figure 5 shows the age distribution of the labor force at\n10-year intervals since 1994, indicating that the age distribution has shifted to somewhat\nolder workers on average. Older workers generally experience lower unemployment\nrates than workers new to the labor force, so the unemployment rate that is consistent\nwith scant inflation pressure may have declined.\nAlso, the skills of the labor force, as proxied by educational attainment (Figure\n6), have improved in the United States. There are fewer workers who have not\ncompleted high school, and more workers with college or graduate degrees. Skilled\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkers tend to have lower unemployment rates than less-skilled workers. This might\nalso be a factor that was underappreciated and may help to explain why there are yet to\nbe significant wage or price pressures.\nIn sum, the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment appears to\nhave declined. Estimates of full employment can and do change, which is one reason the\nFOMC has not provided a numerical estimate for full employment. And simple rules that\nassume the full employment level of unemployment is constant could provide misleading\nguideposts for setting monetary policy.\n\nDeterminants of Interest Rates\nRecent Summaries of Economic Projections have also reflected substantial\nchanges in the level of the federal funds rate that FOMC participants expect in the longer\nrun. Figure 7 shows that both the midpoint of participants’ estimates of the federal funds\nrate in the longer run and the range of the central tendency have moved down over the\npast three years. Since the FOMC has not changed its inflation target, this would imply\nthat the real federal funds rate is expected to be lower in the longer run.8\nFigure 8 shows that the reduction in estimates of the federal funds rate in the\nlonger run come at a time when prevailing long-term rates in most developed countries\nhave moved to unusually low levels. I would suggest that seeing longer-term rates (these\n10-year government bond yields) well below the stated inflation target may indicate a\nlack of faith internationally in some central banks’ ability to achieve those inflation\ntargets on average over the 10-year period – coupled with the likelihood of very low real\nrates over the next 10 years. This could be evidence of a global savings glut, as\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsuggested at one point by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke;9 or it could reflect\ninadequate investment opportunities, as suggested by former Treasury Secretary,\nProfessor Larry Summers.10\nAnother reason why real rates may have fallen is that households and firms may\nhave become more risk averse as a result of the financial crisis, and increased their\nprecautionary savings. Figure 9 shows that checkable deposits and currency for\nhouseholds are quite high by historical standards, as are holdings by nonfinancial\ncorporate businesses, shown in Figure 10.11\nDecreased productivity typically also leads to lower real interest rates, all other\nthings equal. Figure 11 shows that, indeed, productivity has slowed recently to a pace\nmuch lower than experienced on average over the past two decades.\nLower longer-run, or equilibrium, federal funds rates have several implications:\n\n\nFirst, if the longer-run federal funds rate has declined, rates do not need to rise\nas much to return to “normalized” interest rates. This is one reason that rate\nincreases might not need to follow as steep a path as in previous recoveries.\n\n\n\nSecond, lower longer-run federal funds rates imply that in the future,\npolicymakers will have less room to lower interest rates in the event of\neconomic weakness, and will thus be more likely to hit the zero lower bound\nfor interest rates. The zero lower bound constraint on policy interest rates has\nbeen more than an academic concern of late, as most developed countries’\ncentral banks have experienced difficulty in providing sufficient monetary\nstimulus to spur a robust recovery in their economies. This may imply that\ninflation targets have been set too low. After all, a higher inflation target\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwould mean a higher longer-run policy rate, which brings with it a lower\nchance of hitting the zero lower bound.\n\n\nThird, the longer-run federal funds rate is assumed to be constant in most\nsimple policy rules. The fact that the real interest rate may change in both the\nintermediate and longer runs provides a further rationale for looking beyond\nsimple monetary rules.\n\nConcluding Observations\nFigure 12 compares the FOMC participants’ forecasts for the federal funds rate\nexpected to prevail at the end of 2015, from the December and the March SEPs. The\n“dots” indicate that many participants lowered their expectations for the federal funds\nrate for the end of this year. While this could be due to a weaker near-term outlook for\neconomic growth, it could also be consistent with participants revising their assessments\nof appropriate policy in light of declining estimates of both the full-employment level of\nunemployment and the longer-run federal funds rate.\nToday I have provided two examples of variables that have changed quite\nnoticeably, but which normally do not change in simple monetary policy rules. This is an\nargument against the simple rules that several policymakers have proposed. Simple\nmonetary rules cannot capture the full complexity involved in determining appropriate\nmonetary policy, especially during periods when economic relationships may be\nchanging.\nAs such, rigidly following such rules would, in my view, be misguided. Many of\nthese simple rules would have dictated a tighter policy for some time, even as\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL April 16, 2015 at 1:35 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time (6:35 P.M. Local Time in London) OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemployment has fallen short of full employment and inflation has run below our 2\npercent goal, more than seven years since the start of the recession. For me, there is\nwisdom in utilizing a more flexible and comprehensive set of variables and models when\nconsidering appropriate monetary policy.\nI would emphasize that despite their shortcomings, funds rate equations such as\nthose advocated by John Taylor do play a role in monetary policy formulation. In the\nU.S., they serve as useful benchmarks, because they can often capture rough contours of\nthe historical regularities in central bank policy over specific periods. And the fact that\nsome inputs to the model are difficult to estimate does not render them useless. We face\nsimilar uncertainties in estimating all of the economic relationships that operate in our\ncomplex economies. But it does highlight that rules are likely best used as guidelines,\nalong with a host of other inputs – the most important of which are good judgment and\nhard-won experience.\nThank you again for inviting me to Chatham House to share these perspectives on\nthe economy and monetary policy.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150318a.htm\n\n2\n\nAs measured by the year-over-year percent change in the core PCE or Personal Consumption Expenditures\nPrice Index, excluding food and energy.\n3\n\nSummary of Economic Projections, March 2015:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150318.pdf\n4\n\nSee John B.

This example of a simple policy rule relates the federal funds rate to current inflation\nrelative to a 2 percent target and the unemployment rate relative to the natural rate of unemployment. Such\nsimple monetary policy rules rely on significant assumptions, including that r* and u* are fixed.\n6\n\nThis is just one of the perils. For example these simple rules do not include a variable that captures large\nscale asset purchases, one of the major tools used by central banks in developed countries around the world\nin recent years. Others include the rigidity of assigning fixed emphases (or weights) on inflation versus\nemployment, which may not be optimal in all circumstances. In addition, the notion that assumed or\nestimated historical response coefficients represent the best that monetary policymakers can do in any\ncircumstances is a very strong assumption. Further, these simple rules do not capture financial stability\nissues, an area that has been receiving increasing attention since the financial crisis. There is also an issue\nwith the nonlinearity of the rules in general (ex. we do not raise rates when the unemployment rate falls\nfrom 10 to 9 percent).

U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n“Lessons from the U.S. Experience with\nQuantitative Easing”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics and\nMoody’s Investors Service's 8th Joint Event on\nSovereign Risk and Macroeconomics\nFrankfurt, Germany\nFebruary 5, 2015\n\nI would like to thank Adam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for\nInternational Economics, for inviting me here to provide my perspective on the\nquantitative easing programs in the United States.\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThe expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ended with the completion\nof the tapering process last October, but we still are a long way from normalizing either\nshort-term interest rates or our balance sheet. As a result, it may be some time before a\nfull assessment of the effects of our quantitative easing policies can be made, since a full\nevaluation will require a successful return to a normalized monetary policy. Nonetheless,\nI think it is quite possible and appropriate at this point to consider which design features\nof the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program were effective, and which were less\nsuccessful, in achieving our monetary policy goals.\nIn addition to considering the design features, I will also consider the equally\nimportant communications strategy. Communications, often referred to as forward\nguidance, are an increasingly important component of monetary policy, especially when\nshort-term interest rates are at the zero lower bound.\nAn important caveat here is that institutional, structural, and governance\ndifferences across the world’s central banks can make comparisons of policy actions (and\ntheir efficacy) quite difficult. Perhaps the most important difference between the Fed in\nthe United States and most central banks in developed countries is that Congress assigned\nthe Federal Reserve a “dual mandate” – the twin goals of achieving maximum sustainable\nemployment as well as stable prices – rather than a single mandate related only to\ninflation.\nHowever, another important difference involves the restrictions on securities that\nthe Fed can purchase for its open market account. We are limited to securities that have\nthe full backing of the U.S. government, and thus have purchased government-guaranteed\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and U.S. Treasury securities. Such restrictions vary\nsignificantly across the world’s central banks.\nReflecting on the financial crisis and its aftermath, I have become convinced that\nthe dual mandate is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve moved more aggressively\nthan many other central banks to address the significant undershooting of inflation that\nwe saw in the U.S., and that many other countries have experienced. Given the imperfect\nunderstanding of inflation dynamics, even a string of quarters in which inflation\nsignificantly undershoots its target may be reasonably interpreted as a temporary\nshortfall, since deviations of this magnitude and persistence still lie well within the\naccuracy of current inflation forecasting models. However, the substantial increase in\nunemployment throughout the developed world, in combination with the below-target\ninflation rates, indicates that significant output gaps do exist. How aggressively a central\nbank reacts to this situation depends on whether that central bank’s mandated goals\ninvolve inflation alone, or as in the U.S., a dual mandate that includes employment.\nHowever, I would argue that regardless of mandate, delays by central banks in\nmoving to address the undershooting on inflation can be costly – especially if such delays\nlead households and firms to expect very low inflation rates.\nIn the United States, the decline in inflation during the recession afforded us more\nlatitude to aggressively focus on the employment side of our dual mandate. Given the\npainful disruptions in labor markets that the U.S. experienced, this emphasis seemed\nappropriate, and does so with hindsight, and with all due consideration to the possibility\nof structural shifts in labor markets. I felt it was important that the focus on weak labor\nmarkets, as well as the undershooting of inflation, together provided important support\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nfor U.S. monetary policymakers to decide to move aggressively during the financial\ncrisis, and indeed its long aftermath.\nOf course today, after significant labor market improvement, and with the horizon\nover which inflation will return to its target being uncertain, inflation has taken on a more\nprominent role in our deliberations.\nCurrently, an obvious caveat in interpreting the low inflation rate in the U.S. is the\nsupporting role played by the recent decline in energy prices. Oil shocks have been\nassociated with major changes in monetary policy before. The failure to control inflation\nin the United States during the 1970s, in the presence of an adverse oil supply shock,\nhighlighted a serious dilemma facing monetary policy at that time. Importantly in that\ncase, what might have been a temporary pass-through of oil to non-oil prices turned into\na more lasting problem with overall inflation, as wage and price dynamics at that time\nhelped turn increases in oil prices into fairly protracted increases in overall inflation.\nFormer Federal Reserve Board Chairman Volcker is rightfully recognized for taking\nforceful action to address the situation and ultimately tame inflation in the United States.\nCurrently, a concern is that central banks are facing the mirror image of the\nproblem in the 1970s. The problem of significantly undershooting inflation – a dynamic\nwhich could well keep interest rates at the zero lower bound – is likely to be a key\nchallenge to central bankers in the first two decades of the 21st century. And I would say\nthat as with the oil shock in the 1970s, the current shock has served to accentuate a\npotential monetary policy pitfall – in this case, the failure to quickly and vigorously\naddress a significant undershooting of inflation targets, potentially leaving economies\nstagnant at the zero lower bound.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThere are three observations I will make today. First, that a significant\nundershooting of the inflation target should be treated with the same policy urgency as a\nsignificant overshooting of the inflation target. Second, that open-ended quantitative\neasing tied to policy goals is likely to be much more effective than limited quantitativeeasing programs. Third, that clarity on monetary policy communications is difficult to\nachieve, but critically important for the success of the program. I would add that this\nfinal point is as critical to how we normalize policy as it is to how we initiate quantitative\neasing policies.\n\nThe Design of Large-Scale Asset Purchases in the United States\nWhile there were three separate large-scale asset purchase programs in the United\nStates, I will only briefly focus on the first one, since it was at least partly designed to\naddress dysfunctional markets during the height of the financial crisis. In addition to\naddressing the shortfall in macroeconomic goals, this program was focused on purchases\nof mortgage securities, and sought to relieve the weak demand for mortgage-backed\nsecurities when markets became quite illiquid and risked becoming much more so. This\nprogram has generally been viewed as a successful way to stabilize markets, but isolating\nits effects is complicated because it occurred in the midst of the financial crisis.\nFigure 1 provides details of the large-scale asset purchase programs commonly\nreferred to as “QE1,” “QE2,” and “QE3.” QE1 was announced on November 25, 2008,\nwith purchases beginning shortly thereafter.1 Initial purchases were of agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), “to provide support to the mortgage and\nhousing markets.”2 Additional agency debt and MBS purchases were announced in\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMarch 2009, along with the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, all to “provide\ngreater support to mortgage lending and housing markets” and “to help improve\nconditions in private credit markets.” 3 The program concluded in March 2010.\nPurchases totaled $1.25 trillion in agency MBS, $175 billion in agency debt, and $300\nbillion in longer-term Treasury securities. 4\nQE2 began in November 2010, and ended in June 2011. The program committed\nto purchase $600 billion of longer-term securities by the middle of 2011.5 Unlike QE1, it\nwas focused solely on purchasing long-term Treasury securities, and did not include the\npurchase of mortgage securities – which had been the focus of that first large-scale asset\npurchase program.\nThe purchase program did not fully meet expectations in terms of achieving\nmonetary policy goals. As a result, in September of 2011 – only three months after the\nend of QE2 – the Federal Reserve announced the Maturity Extension Program\n(commonly referred to as “Operation Twist”). This program was designed to lengthen\nthe average maturity of the Fed’s Treasury securities portfolio, by purchasing long-term\nsecurities and selling an equal amount of short-term securities. The program removed\nduration from private holdings of Treasury securities, but did not increase the overall\namount of the securities portfolio held by the Federal Reserve. The goal was to decrease\nthe longer-term rates that tend to affect the real economy; in fact the FOMC statement at\nthe time highlighted that the program should “put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates.” 6\nThe initial program was a purchase of $400 billion in long-term Treasury\nsecurities, and clearly had the intended effect on long term rates. The program was\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nextended in June 2012, at which point the program was limited by the lack of short-term\nsecurities to sell, and ended in December 2012.7 At the time this eliminated our holdings\nof T-bills and very short term notes.\nThe third quantitative easing program began in September 2012.8 The program\nbegan as a monthly purchase of $40 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, in\naddition to the Treasury securities that were being purchased (or swapped) under the\n“Twist” program. Unlike QE2, QE3 was an open-ended program. The continuation of\nthe program was tied to substantial improvement in labor markets, consistent with price\nstability. In this way the communication emphasized the need to achieve the policy goals\nrather than a given size of the program. Communications also emphasized that the\nprogram would “put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates” and “support\nmortgage markets.” When the Maturity Extension Program ended in December 2012\nbecause of a lack of short-term Treasury securities remaining in the portfolio, the\nprogram was adjusted to the outright purchase (rather than exchange or swap) of $45\nbillion per month in longer-term Treasury securities, in addition to the purchase of $40\nbillion per month in mortgage-backed securities.9\nFigure 2 shows the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over this\nperiod. QE2 expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by $600 billion, to a little\nbelow $3 trillion. Operation Twist did not influence the overall size of the balance sheet.\nQE3 significantly increased the balance sheet to the current size of approximately $4.5\ntrillion.\nFigure 3 shows the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. It shows the\nprogression from QE2 – where the expansion primarily involved Treasury securities with\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\na 5 to 10 year maturity – to a balance sheet with much larger holdings of mortgagebacked securities, and Treasury securities with more than 10 years to maturity.\n\nImpact of Programs\nA number of good event studies have attempted to evaluate the impact of the\npurchase programs in a narrow time window around the program-announcement dates.10\nIn general, the studies find roughly a 20 to 25 basis point reduction in long-term rates\nassociated with a purchase of $500 billion in long-term assets, although there is a high\ndegree of imprecision involved.\nIn particular, with numerous Federal Reserve officials publicly discussing\npossible policy options, the timing of exactly when the market came to expect a new\nprogram is hard to pinpoint. It is very difficult to isolate the extent of the “news”\ncontained in any announcement – news about either the timing or magnitude of a\nprogram.\nFigure 4 shows 10-year Treasury yields around the time of announcements\nrelated to the three quantitative easing programs. QE1 was announced on November 25,\n2008, with the announcement reiterated in the FOMC statement on December 16, 2008.\nAdditional purchases were announced in the FOMC statement released on March 18,\n2009. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 24 basis points on the day of the November\nannouncement, and an additional 12 basis points on the following day. On the day of the\nMarch announcement of additional purchases, the 10-year Treasury rate fell 51 basis\npoints.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nTreasury yields, at much lower levels by the November 3, 2010 announcement of\nQE2, fell by 14 basis points the day following the announcement, but drifted slightly\nupward over the next couple of weeks.\nAs QE3 was contemplated, 10-year Treasury yields hovered at historic lows well\nunder 2 percent. (Because of the low levels, please note that the scale on the chart for\nQE3 is different than the scale for the QE1 and QE2 charts.) QE3 was announced in the\nFOMC statement on September 13, 2012. However, shortly prior to the announcement,\non August 31, 2102, Chairman Bernanke spoke at the annual Jackson Hole symposium\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.11\nOn the day of Bernanke’s speech, the 10-year Treasury yield declined by 6 basis\npoints. However, on the day after the QE3 announcement, the 10-year Treasury yield\nrose 13 basis points but then adopted a downward trend, falling over 20 basis points over\nthe next two weeks, easing the initial jump. Through the announcement of QE3, 10-year\nTreasury rates had fallen approximately 200 basis points, which was the immediate goal\nof the program.\nWhile measuring the reduction in rates is one way to capture the impact of the\nprogram, the real goal is to have a significant impact on economic variables more\ngenerally. QE1 was meant to stem the tide of the deepening recession; the economy’s\nmomentum was highly contractionary and QE1 was meant to moderate the resulting\ndecline in output. On the other hand, the later two QEs were meant to stimulate the\neconomy.\nThe FOMC statement announcing QE3 highlighted the desire to support mortgage\nmarkets. Figure 5 shows that there was no notable change in housing starts during the\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nperiod of QE2. However, housing starts did improve over the period of Operation Twist\nand QE3. After averaging 569,000 units during QE2, starts averaged 708,000 units from\nearly on in Operation Twist through August 2012. During the past 6 months, starts have\nimproved to averaging over 1 million units.\nFigure 6 shows the path of housing prices. With housing prices declining, it was\nvery hard to see or generate momentum in the housing market. Housing prices continued\nto decline during QE2, but began to rise somewhat steadily – albeit modestly – in late\n2011, with Operation Twist underway for several months. Housing prices continued their\nupward trend during QE3.\nFigure 7 shows that QE2 did not generate much momentum in auto and lightweight truck sales, which did pick up during Operation Twist and QE3. During QE2,\nauto and light truck sales were averaging 12.4 million units. Midway through Operation\nTwist, and as QE3 began, auto sales had risen to an average of nearly 15 million units,\nand over the past six months auto sales have averaged nearly 17 million units.\nOne of the transmission mechanisms is to alter asset prices other than interest\nrates. Figure 8 illustrates that while there was not much momentum in stock prices from\nQE2, there was a substantial improvement over the period of Operation Twist and QE3.\nFigures 9 and 10 illustrate what happened to measures of the two goals\nembedded in the Fed’s dual mandate over this period. The unemployment rate fell\nappreciably over the period. Core PCE inflation reached 2 percent during Operation\nTwist, but has generally been persistently below the 2 percent target. In part, the\npresence of full employment in the mandate, and the pain being felt in U.S. labor markets\n– coupled with core inflation below 2 percent – provided plenty of support for aggressive\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\npolicy actions. The FOMC statements noted the need for substantial improvement in\nlabor markets, and the statements related to QE3 eventually incorporated an\nunemployment threshold.\nIn sum, in the absence of the dual mandate, some significant and I would say\nneeded policy actions may not have occurred – Operation Twist when core PCE was\nrelatively close to the 2 percent target, and QE3 when core inflation trended at roughly 50\nbasis points below 2 percent. Had these policy actions not occurred, it would in my view\nhave prevented what was ultimately important pre-emptive action against a persistent\nundershooting of the inflation target that could have become much worse, as in some\nother parts of the globe.\nQE2 was limited in scope. It had a fixed purchase amount and was not\ncommunicated in a manner tied to goals. Moreover, it was focused on Treasury securities\nrather than on areas with larger spreads, such as mortgages. And there is little evidence it\nhad the desired impact on rates or real variables.\nIn contrast, QE3 was limited only by the progress made against the goals. The\npurchases were open-ended, and the communication was firmly tied to goals. It included\nareas with larger spreads such as mortgages. And both financial variables and real\nvariables showed improvement with this program.\nIn summary, program design, and communication, both matter. A program that is\nopen-ended and focused on areas where spreads are large – in conjunction with a\ncommunication strategy tied to goals – seems to have made a material difference in\noutcomes. While the transmission channels of large-scale asset purchases are still not\ncompletely understood, it seems to me that the signaling and communication tied to a\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nlarge-scale asset purchase are an important channel – but one that unfortunately is hard to\naccurately quantify.\n\nExit Strategies\nAt this point no central bank has fully normalized its policy stance. However, as\nmy discussion has highlighted, communication and actions around exit are likely to be as\nimportant as they were at initiation. I am pleased that the United States has experienced\nmuch improved labor markets and inflation rates that, while below target, are higher –\nless close to dangerously low or negative rates – than in some, if not many, developed\ncountries.\nNonetheless, policy should not be focused on progress from where we have been,\nbut should instead be focused on meeting the ultimate goals in a timely fashion. At this\ntime, there is insufficient evidence that U.S. inflation is clearly trending toward the 2\npercent goal. While labor markets have continued to improve, the employment cost\nindex (ECI) overall, and the occupational breakdown of the ECI shown in Figure 11,\nshow little evidence of trending to pre-crisis levels.\nWhile disentangling the impact of positive energy shocks on prices will be\ndifficult, we know that the PCE core inflation rate remains well below the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target. Given how low total and core inflation have fallen in most\ndeveloped countries, a policy of patience in the United States continues to be appropriate.\nThis is particularly true given the inherent asymmetry that we face at the zero lower\nbound – meaning, while we have all kinds of room to respond to an unexpectedly\nfavorable shock, we remain quite limited in our ability to respond to negative shocks.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:00 A.M. in Frankfurt, Germany OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConcluding Observations\nMy remarks have focused on the United States experience. Given the different\nplaces central banks in developed countries are on policy at this time, it is likely\npremature to draw hard and fast conclusions for the global context. Certainly the\nJapanese experience of raising the rate of inflation with a broad open-ended program tied\nto its policy goal is encouraging. Similarly, we will all learn from recently announced\nprograms being initiated in Europe.\nThe relatively recent focus among central banks around the world on addressing\nthe problem of persistently low inflation rates is in my view very encouraging. Just as\nhigh inflation in the 1970s was a pernicious problem for central banks, the problems\ngenerated by low inflation and interest rates settling at the zero lower bound were\nunderestimated by professional economists and central bankers alike. The broad focus on\nmeeting central bank mandates is important, and actions being taken to achieve inflation\ntargets should result in a more robust global economy.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s press release announcing the action on November 25, 2008 stated “This action is\nbeing taken to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses, which in\nturn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally.”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm\n\n2\n\nSee the statement from the December 16, 2008 FOMC meeting:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081216b.htm\n3\n\nSee the statement from the March 18, 2009 FOMC meeting:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 5, 2015 at 5:00 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at forum on\n“Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and\nCurrent Regulatory Priorities”\norganized by\nthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\nand the Financial Stability Institute\nCape Town, South Africa\nJanuary 30, 2015\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky, chairman of the Financial\nStability Institute of the Bank for International Settlements, for inviting me to speak at\nthis forum. The Institute serves an important role by increasing awareness of financial\nstability issues and highlighting actions that can be taken to address vulnerabilities.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nToday I am pleased to speak with you about a very important topic – cyber\nsecurity for banks, payments systems, and central banks – and its implications for\nfinancial stability. As I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express\ntoday are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board\nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAs we all know, innovations in computing and communications technologies are\nrapidly altering the landscape of payments. And overseeing the safety, security, and\nefficiency of payment systems is a major responsibility of many central banks. Indeed, I\nwould argue that for central banks, the transmission of monetary policy, the provision of\nservices to financial intermediaries, and the supervision of the banking system are\nintegrally linked.\nHowever, payment systems are becoming less bank-centric and are changing\nmuch more quickly than their regulatory framework. As payment systems quickly evolve\nwith new technologies, a potentially serious financial stability concern is inherent in\ncyber security. So, today I am going to describe why I view cyber security as one of the\nmost serious financial stability concerns facing central banks, and why we need to\nbecome more directly involved.1\nBy way of example, consider the many payment choices available to a consumer\nwhen simply purchasing a shirt. The consumer can go to the store and use cash, a debit\ncard, a credit card, a prepaid card, or even a mobile phone. Alternatively, the shirt can be\npurchased on the Internet, the consumer paying with a credit card or signature debit card,\nPayPal, direct debit from a bank account, or alternatively using a mobile app such as\nApple Pay or Google Wallet.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEach of these transaction options would involve combinations of different\npayment systems, intermediaries, and technologies. Because these options ultimately\nride on traditional banking and payment “rails,” consumers see little need to consider\nwhether the behind-the-scenes technology, accounting, and bookkeeping functions are\ntruly available, safe, and secure.\nDespite the advantages to consumers and businesses from rapid innovation in\npayments systems, cyber-security issues are beginning to intrude. Cyber crime has\ndirectly affected millions of consumers.2 The value of stolen data has grown\nexponentially with the evolution of a very sophisticated black market for personal\ninformation.3 All this highlights one of the economic risks of moving to electronic\npayments – a wide (and growing) variety of entry points for those looking to steal, divert,\nor disrupt payments.\nWhen financial gain is the primary motivation behind the fraud, there are three\noptions for containment. First, prevent the intruder from entering the system. Second,\nand often more importantly, prevent the intruder’s ability to leave the system with\nconfidential data. Or third, devalue the data so it is meaningless to an intruder who gains\naccess to it.\nNews media have reported thefts involving consumers’ credit card information.\nTo date, these incidents have not resulted in systemic shocks to the economy or to\npayments networks. Still, should breaches continue, a lack of confidence in traditional\npayments may lead people to less efficient options. Likewise, while these events do not\nreally introduce systemic risk from a total-dollar-value perspective, they nonetheless\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncontribute to the erosion of confidence in payment mechanisms and ultimately increase\noverall transaction costs.\nA more serious case would be an attack on payment systems aimed at disrupting\ntransactions, for example by a rogue state or entity. Prevention is difficult because the\nattacker does not need to “enter” the system to be disruptive, and there is no need to exit\nwith confidential data – all the attacker needs to do is flood the public-facing “front door”\nof a payments processor with enough traffic to make the system unavailable.4 However,\nthe bad actors are moving on to much more nefarious ways of penetrating processing\nassets.\nPreventing disruption puts an emphasis on ensuring that resiliency, monitoring,\ndetection, and recovery capabilities are designed into, and operational in, any payment\nsystem. An attack on payment systems that renders consumers and businesses unable to\ntransact business could be extremely disruptive and could possibly cripple an economy.\nTo that end, the adoption of a national defense grade security level, rather than a\ncommercial grade security level, would mean a much more resilient – albeit expensive –\npayment system.\nToday I will briefly discuss how complex our payment system has become, and\nconsider susceptibility to cyber-related interruptions. I will then discuss the financial\nstability concerns inherent in current arrangements. As an example, I will discuss the\npayment disruptions that occurred after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. I will\nmention some steps that need to be taken, some specific actions being taken by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, and a recent report issued by the Federal Reserve.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI. Payments Systems\nThere are a variety of payment systems in the U.S., and the volume and dollarvalue of the transactions that flow through them is striking. The 12 regional Federal\nReserve Banks collectively process over $4 trillion in payments every day.5 However,\nthe U.S. payments landscape encompasses much more than those processed by the central\nbank. In the realm of so-called “retail” payments, there are a variety of payment systems\nor networks that directly support credit and debit card payments as well as Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) payments, and that indirectly support intermediaries such as\nPayPal, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay. There are also payment systems devoted to\n“wholesale” funds transfers, including Fedwire Funds transfers, Fedwire Securities\ntransactions, and the Clearing House Interbank Payments System or CHIPS.6,7 Other\nsystems focus on securities transfers and payments related to stocks, bonds, options, and\nderivatives.\nIt is perhaps easiest to consider cyber crime in the context of a generic retail\npayment, as shown in Figure 1. The consumer can choose from a variety of payment\nmethods and platforms8 to initiate a transaction. The transaction information and\npayment method then enter the merchant’s computer system. For a credit or debit\naccount payment, the merchant (or third-party processor or “acquirer”) transmits the\naccount information to the issuing entity for authorization. The issuing entity approves\n(or rejects) the authorization back through the processor to the merchant. The payment\ninvolves the issuing entity or its bank sending funds to the merchant’s bank, with\nsettlement on the books of the Fed.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAt each stage of the transaction, a different party may have customer information\n– which, if stolen or destroyed, could impact other parties to the transaction. At the point\nof initiation, the consumer could be tricked into providing account information, or during\nprocessing any of the institutions could expose the customer’s information to a third\nparty.9\nFraudsters have typically targeted consumer payments, making them a critical\narea for focus – and one where large-scale hacking incidents have been well-publicized.\nShould fraud become so widespread that customers lose confidence in the safety of\npayment transactions, the entire payment landscape (both retail point-of-sale and ecommerce) could be severely impacted and entire transaction models could be imperiled.\nUnfortunately, the retail space is only one area where cyber-security breaches\ncould impinge on payment systems. Figure 2 shows the U.S. regulatory arrangements\ncovering payment, clearing and settlement systems. As the figure illustrates, payment\nsystems extend well beyond retail payments to other areas also susceptible to cybersecurity problems.\nArguably, the complicated payment structure10 is actually something of an\nadvantage in that the payment system is decentralized. Without a single point of failure,\nproblems in one area may not directly impinge on other areas – at least not\nimmediately.11 But, with diffuse roles and responsibilities in the payments landscape,\ninvolving both the private and public sectors – and with attackers looking for the weakest\nlink – a unified cyber-prevention approach is difficult to implement. The complex\nlandscape means a significant investment is required to protect the many potential points\nof failure. Also, complexity makes it difficult to react in a more coordinated fashion to\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconcerns. A particular worry relates to attacks where the purpose is not financial gain, but\nrather disruption of payment systems and economic activity.\n\nII. Disruptions of Payment Systems\nThe attacks on September 11, 2001 had impacts beyond the tragic loss of life and\nmassive destruction of property – including impacts on payment systems. Because the\nWorld Trade Center was located near Wall Street, numerous payment systems were\naffected. Insufficient resiliency became clear – for example, the New York Stock\nExchange halted trading for four days. The flow of funds through the banking system\nwas also impacted.12 Some banks did not have sufficient back-up systems and could not\nreceive incoming funds. This resulted in some banks having a surplus, while others\nfound themselves short of funds or reserves.\nFigure 3 shows the dramatic increase in the volume of federal funds (Fed Funds)\nand Discount Window loans that occurred as banks tried to reallocate funds or reserves\naround the payment system during that period. Work by McAndrews and Potter13 on the\nliquidity effects of the events of September 11 documents that both the value and volume\nof Fedwire activity declined by well over 20 percent, as some banks had difficulty\ncommunicating with customers and counterparties, and some institutions lost the ability\nto track the flow of funds.\nWithin a week, most payment flows had been restored. Banks were able to recreate files and restore lost infrastructure. In addition, actions taken by the Federal\nReserve facilitated recovery – the Federal Reserve not only helped restore financial\ncommunications, but also waived overdraft fees, actively encouraged borrowing from the\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDiscount Window, and conducted open market operations to increase reserves in the\nbanking system.\nIn reaction to the disruption, significant longer-run actions were taken. The\nInteragency White Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S.\nFinancial System14 required fundamental changes to prevent a similar shock from having\na large impact in the future. Payment systems and financial institutions made costly\nimprovements that dramatically improved the speed at which payments activities could\nbe restored.\nWith September 11, the implications of physical damage became fully evident.\nThe corrective activities focused on geographic dispersion, and resiliency for a physical\nevent. In contrast, a cyber-attack could have greater scale and take an extended period of\ntime to play out prior to the full impact being known. And adversaries are well funded,\nand have time to evaluate and plan. We need to consider and protect against many and\nall types of attacks, while adversaries need just one vulnerability – and we must assume\nthey are always trying.\nWhile the payment disruptions that followed the September 11 attacks were not\nrelated to cyber security, there are analogies and lessons that can be applied to a more\nproactive and coordinated approach.15 Underlying infrastructures need to better ensure\nthat payment providers take sufficient precautions to minimize the likelihood and impact\nof cyber attacks – whether commercially motivated or focused on disruption. This will\nrequire a level of information-sharing and expectation-setting by national defense\nagencies, regulators, supervisors, and operators exceeding that of today’s very\nfragmented but dynamic payment systems.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn the U.S., legislation aimed at improving the way information is shared among\nthe public and private sector has stalled due to privacy and other liability concerns.\nHowever, the Obama administration has noted that cyber threats are “one of the most\nserious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation”16 and is\npromoting legislation to require enhanced threat information sharing among the two\nsectors.\n\nIII. Addressing Cyber Security\nIn addition to addressing cyber security with a more integrated and holistic\napproach among the large payment systems operators, there is work that central banks\nshould be considering on the local and smaller-scale levels. Figure 4 highlights some of\nthe significant cyber-security problems that have been experienced by major business\nentities as a result of their suppliers or sub-contractors being compromised. Often, it\nseems, the initially-compromised organizations tend to be smaller and less sophisticated,\nand may not have sufficient resources to protect against a hacker intent on using the\nweakest link to penetrate a computer system that reaches, and could impact, other entities\nand systems.\nIn the United States we have over 6,000 banks, and many are small institutions\nwith modest information technology teams who often have job responsibilities beyond\ncyber-security. These smaller financial institutions do not have regular access to national\nsecurity briefings and often rely on outside vendors or third-party processors, many of\nwhom may also be relatively small organizations with limited cyber-security capabilities.\nDespite their best efforts, such institutions may provide determined intruders the least\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntechnically advanced defenses and easiest entry points into payment systems. So\nbolstering the awareness and defenses of these sorts of smaller organizations should be a\npriority.\nSharing actionable information about cyber attacks has the potential to\nsignificantly improve a firm’s preparedness. Some larger institutions have committed to\nshare cyber-threat information in a more real-time manner, or through industry\ncollaboration forums such as the Financial Services-Information Sharing Analysis\nCenter17. Still, many government agencies and cyber-security firms are reticent to share\ninformation and discuss problems because of potential legal liabilities, or reputational\nrisk concerns.\nIn 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston began a pilot program focused on\nthe sharing of cyber-threat information by, and among, small- to medium-sized banks.\nThis pilot, for a specific segment of a single industry, was very successful. We intend to\nexpand the program in 2015. Importantly, the program is not part of our supervisory\noversight of banks, but instead is conducted by Boston Fed cyber-security experts, who\ncan share information about emerging threats and mitigants. All participants sign a nondisclosure legal agreement that stipulates that the information provided is shared for the\nsole purpose of allowing members to improve their own cyber defenses, and cannot be\nused for any other purpose.18 While still in the early stages of implementation, the initial\nresults are encouraging. The experience to date highlights that more peer sharing for\ngroups of smaller institutions has the potential to help thwart cyber criminals’ potential\nentry to the payment systems.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSimilarly, the Boston Fed is a founding member of the Advanced Cyber Security\nCenter (ACSC), a nonprofit organization that brings together industry, university, and\ngovernment organizations to address the most advanced cyber threats. A key focus is\nsharing cyber threat information. The Boston Fed facilitates monthly “Cyber Tuesdays”\nto enable discussion among security practitioners on emerging issues and the state of the\ncyber threat environment.\nAnd earlier this week, the Federal Reserve System issued a paper on Strategies\nfor Improving the U.S. Payment System.19\n\nA key strategy highlighted in the paper\n\ninvolves working “to reduce fraud risk and advance the safety, security and resiliency of\nthe payment system.” The paper notes the Federal Reserve belief that security is the\nfoundation of any payment system, and our intent to work with a wide range of\nstakeholders to promote an environment where end-to-end payments security preserves\nprivacy and integrity, commands high public confidence, and improves continuously in\nresponse to evolving threats. The paper has a somewhat different focus, but\ncomplements, what I’ve talked about today. 20\n\nConcluding Observations\nCyber security is a serious financial stability concern. The potential for loss of\ntrust in payment systems due to incursions or disruption is a key consideration. Beyond\nintrusions with financial motivation, the increased activity of rogue states or entities in\nwhat is essentially cyber warfare or cyber terrorism changes and elevates the nature of the\nprotections necessary.21\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 9:45 A.M. in Cape Town, South Africa OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIn general, central banks need to focus on how best to address this emerging\nconcern and play a proactive role in assuring the cyber resiliency of payment systems.\nGiven privacy and secrecy concerns, open communication of threats and mitigants is\noften problematic. And as I discussed today, the rapid technological evolution of\npayment systems has resulted in a highly fragmented and diffuse regulatory framework.\nThere are serious challenges and obstacles to comprehensive solutions. Central banks are\nessential to this discussion and to the progress that needs to be made. And given the\nimportance of a safe and available payment system to the functioning of a nation’s\neconomy, investment in core aspects of systems to ensure they are as secure and cyber\nresilient as possible must be a national priority.\nOur efforts cannot focus solely on preventing incursions, because almost certainly\nsomeone will ultimately breach many cyber defenses. The focus should also be on rapid\ndetection, limiting damage, and rapid remediation of damaged resources.\nBecause the weakest link provides the greatest opportunity for intruders, focusing\nsolely on the largest players is unwise. Whether a financial institution is located in\nNorthern Maine or near the tip of South Africa, cyber threats know no borders – and\nneither geography nor small size insulate institutions, and the payment systems that they\nare part of, from risk. There are opportunities for central banks to play a more active\nleadership role in this area.\nThank you.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

For example, The Bank for International Settlements’ Committee\non Payments and Market Infrastructure has highlighted the need for more cyber readiness for financial\nmarket infrastructures, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has a working\ngroup focused on raising regulator awareness and improving bank supervision of cyber risk – but\nactionable items are lacking and the Federal Reserve’s Financial Advisory Council has highlighted the need\nfor more sharing of information.\n2\n\nMany consumers with credit or debit cards have experienced the downstream effects of cyber crime.\nThese include the irritation and hassle of a card transaction being denied, or having cards frequently\nreplaced, or having one’s personal information or payment identity stolen, or seeing fraudulent transactions\nthat cause financial or reputational harm.\n3\n\nThe hackers are no longer just using the information themselves, but selling it to criminal computer\nscientists and “quants” that correlate it with other stolen data to make it even more valuable.\n4\n\nMany low cost or free automated tools for doing so are, unfortunately, available – even to unsophisticated\nattackers.\n5\n\nA number equivalent to almost 25 percent of annual U.S. GDP\n\n6\n\nSee http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed36.html\n\n7\n\nAn example of a wholesale payments problem was the system disruption of the Bank of England’s\nClearing House Automated Payments System (CHAPS) which went down for technical issues and resulted\nin the disruption of 2,450 home sales.\n8\n\nSuch as a credit card, debit card, mobile phone, or computer.\n\n9\n\nJavelin Strategy and Research estimates fraud losses from bank and credit card accounts was $16 billion\nlast year, up 45 percent from the previous year. However, this probably underestimates the costs of\nforensic work, law enforcement activities, fraud monitoring, and additional system changes taken to avoid\nrepetition of the problem.\n10\n\nE.g., the complex operating structure, the multi-faceted regulatory environment, and diffuse governance.\n\n11\n\nAlthough, as we witnessed in the financial crisis with subprime mortgages and products like\ncollateralized debt obligations, systemic issues can develop across intermediaries based on indirect factors,\nsuch as a loss of confidence – as happened to Lehman Brothers and AIG.\n\n12\n\nWhile wholesale funding was most impacted, the influence on consumer confidence was important. In\nsome areas, runs on ATMs occurred.\n13\n\nSee http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/02v08n2/0211mcan/0211mcan.html\n\n14\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2003/20030408/default.htm\n\n15\n\ni.e., not waiting until a significant intrusion has wreaked havoc for one or more payment systems.\n\n16\n\nSee http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/13/remarks-president-national-cybersecuritycommunications-integration-cent\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 30, 2015 at 2:45 A.M.

By the way, we have found that in-person meetings are most\nproductive in this regard, rather than audio or video calls. In-person meetings allow a trusted network to\ndevelop over time. We have found that audio calls do not work as well, because some participants are not\nentirely comfortable with who else might be listening in.\n\n19\n\nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/strategies-improving-us-payment-system.pdf\n\n20\n\nThe paper notes that “protection against, prevention of, or elimination of cyber attacks, in general, is an\nimportant topic, but one that is beyond the scope of this desired outcome” [emphasis added]. The paper\ndoes however address cyber security as it relates to payment transactions and payment systems.\n\n21\n\nIndeed, some data indicate a shift of cyber-related events away from financially motivated activity to\nactivity by rogue states, entities, or individuals looking to cause disruption of critical infrastructure, in order\nto advance a specific agenda.\n\n14\n\n\f",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on\n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful\nExit or Bumpy Ride?”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNational Association for Business Economics /\nAmerican Economic Association Meetings\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJanuary 3, 2015\n\nI am happy to be participating on today’s panel, especially since the topic is\nmonetary policy normalization. At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is\nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title. It is a\npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where such a discussion is not just\ntheoretical – where the economy has improved enough for the discussion to move from\nwhether normalization will occur to when normalization will occur.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nIn the year just past, the monetary policy environment has been quite stable –\nperhaps surprisingly stable, given the number of significant monetary policy events that\ntranspired. Over the past year, we have seen new leadership at the Fed, in both a new\nChair and Vice Chair. The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase\nprogram, and provided a revised exit strategy. The FOMC has also shifted the FOMC\nstatement from providing forward guidance tied to labor market outcomes1 to a “patient”\npolicy that is not time dependent.2\nThis all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target\ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates. As the second\npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good\nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year.\nAny change in policy, monetary or otherwise, has the potential for unanticipated\neffects. In assessing the potential consequences of a patient monetary policy response,\nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of\novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing\nundesirably high inflation. I would note, however, that the last time the FOMC raised\nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below\nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at\n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent. Some worry that patience will\nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go\nbefore reaching those conditions, and so have not been unusually patient as yet.\nWhile many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact\ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and\npredictions of turning points are particularly imprecise. While we would all like to know\nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions\nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be\nappropriate. Furthermore, while market participants worry about whether liftoff will\noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic\nimplications of such differences are quite small. Indeed, such circumstances remind us\nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.\nAs such, there are a few key questions to consider at this juncture: Is the\neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to full employment and the 2 percent inflation\ntarget? Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed? Can we be\nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize and perhaps result in a\nneed to reverse policy, particularly considering the policy challenges when short-term\nrates are bounded by zero?\nAs I consider these questions for this cycle, I believe the continued very low core\ninflation and wage growth numbers provide ample justification for patience. A patient\napproach to policy is prudent until we can more confidently expect that inflation will\nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over the next several years. Such patience also\nprovides support to labor markets, boosting the prospects of the many Americans who\nwere adversely impacted by the financial crisis, severe recession, and slow recovery.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nToday I would like to discuss how I think about a so-called “exit strategy” in the\ncontext of a patient monetary policy. I will first compare current economic conditions to\nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate liftoffs following recessions. I\nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative\nmonetary policy more complicated this time compared with the previous two economic\nrecoveries. I will then discuss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial\nvariables and what that history may portend as normalization becomes appropriate in the\nUnited States this time.\n\nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening\nThe timing of the initial tightening of short-term interest rates after a recession\ndepends on several factors, including the position of the economy relative to the Fed’s\nmandated goals of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, the speed at\nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the\nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that\nprogress. Because of the complicated interactions of these and other factors, and the\ndifficulty associated with economic forecasting, I would argue that previous liftoffs can\nprovide only an imperfect guide to likely future actions – but do provide some indication\nof factors that should be considered.\nFigure 1 shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February\n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first rate increase occurred after the recessions\nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gray). The first rate increase in 2004\noccurred when the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, a lower rate than in 1994 and a\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlittle lower than the current 5.8 percent unemployment rate. In both 1994 and 2004, the\nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to\ndecline, and in both instances, the unemployment rate continued to decline after that\ninitial tightening, with the onset of tightening having no perceptible effect on the steady\nimprovement in labor markets.\nFigure 2 uses another indicator of the strength of labor markets: the growth in\npayroll employment. In 1994, the first tightening did not occur until payroll employment\ngrowth was reasonably sustainable, and the economy continued to create jobs as the\ntightening cycle began. In 2004, payroll employment growth was less entrenched and\nsubsequent employment growth also was less solid than in the 1994 tightening episode.\nFigure 3 shows the other element of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate – stable\nprices – using the inflation rate as measured by the PCE price indices. While this\ncomparison across episodes is a bit more complicated, given the possibility that the\nFOMC implicitly used a somewhat higher inflation target in previous years, the PCE\ninflation rate was above 2 percent at the time of the previous two initial rate increases.\nOne compelling reason for patience is the uncertainty surrounding how quickly\ninflation will return to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target. Developed economies around\nthe world have been experiencing inflation rates well below the targets set by their central\nbanks. With current core PCE at 1.4 percent and total PCE at 1.2 percent, current\ninflation remains quite low – and recent data do not yet indicate a clear trend back to 2\npercent. Such low inflation, and the risk that inflation expectations may decline, are\nreasons to allow labor markets to tighten further, which should spur wage growth and\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nincrease the likelihood that inflation will return to the 2 percent target within the next\nseveral years.\nFigure 4 highlights that the first tightening in the previous two recoveries\ncoincided with relatively strong real GDP growth. With third-quarter real GDP growth of\n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likelihood of above-potential\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is\nlikely to foster continued improvement in labor markets.\nFigure 5 contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.\nGiven the improving economy, this index has been growing more slowly than one might\nexpect, and also well below the experience at the time of the two previous tightenings.\nGiven modest increases in productivity and a 2 percent inflation target, we would\nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor\nmarket.\nFigure 6 shows another important distinction between current conditions and\nconditions around the start of the two previous interest rate increases. The Federal\nReserve has substantially increased its balance sheet to help stimulate stronger growth in\nthe economy over the past six years. My own assessment is that this is one reason why\nour economy is stronger and our inflation rate closer to target than is the case for many\nother developed countries. Nonetheless, the level of short-term interest rates understates\nthe degree of accommodation the Fed has provided, given the much larger balance sheet.\nAs the normalization process progresses, the Federal Reserve will need to carefully\nbalance how quickly to normalize short-term rates versus how quickly to normalize its\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbalance sheet – a problem not faced during the two previous periods of monetary policy\ntightening.\nIn sum, three areas stand out as complicating current discussions of raising shortterm interest rates. First, it is unusual that inflation is still well below the Fed’s target,\nwith favorable supply shocks (for example, dramatic declines in oil prices) making\noverall inflation likely to be particularly depressed in the short run. Second, it is unusual\nfor compensation to be so subdued at a time when raising rates is under discussion.\nFinally, it is unusual to have conducted nontraditional monetary policy that enlarged the\nFed’s balance sheet which will need to be normalized in conjunction with normalizing\nshort term rates.\n\nGlobal Complications\nThe global economy provides a potential challenge to policy normalization.\nDuring most monetary policy normalizations, one sees a reasonably high correlation of\neconomic and financial variables across countries. However, in the coming year, it is\nfairly likely that there will be an unusual divergence, with some countries beginning the\nnormalization process while other industrialized countries continue easing domestic\npolicy.\nOne of the key differences across countries has been the divergence in the\ninflation experience, as shown in Figure 7. While Japan has tended to experience a\nmuch lower inflation rate than most other developed economies, Europe and the United\nStates have had relatively similar moderate-inflation experiences, until recently. While\nmost developed economies have been modestly undershooting their inflation targets,\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nEurope’s inflation rate has continued to decline, and has recently diverged significantly\nfrom its target, registering inflation below 0.5 percent. At the same time, U.S. core\ninflation has been reasonably stable at 1.4 to 1.5 percent, and the small effects of an\nappreciating exchange rate and falling oil prices should keep overall inflation quite\nmodest over the near term. In part, this provides the opportunity for a patient monetary\npolicy, at least until wage and price pressures are sufficient to ensure reaching our\ninflation target.\nWhile many developed economies are in a similar position with respect to\ninflation, the likely trajectories for inflation may result in quite different monetary\npolicies, at least initially. Countries worried that disinflation could lead to deflation are\nlikely to continue stimulating their economies, while countries more confident that low\ninflation is temporary (and will soon return to their inflation target) will likely follow less\naccommodative policy. This may result in a more divergent period of global monetary\npolicy than we usually experience during monetary policy normalization.\nAs Figure 8 shows, short-term rates most influenced by monetary policy have\ngenerally tended to move together among developed countries. With short-term interest\nrates moving together, there is less incentive for short-term funds to surge across national\nborders seeking higher returns. However, with some countries tightening while other\ncountries are continuing to ease, exchange rate and asset price dynamics may become\nmore complicated, creating yield differentials that might spur cross-border asset\nreallocation.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nPotential Impact of First Tightening\nFigure 9 illustrates that the reaction of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate to the first\ntightening depends on the context of the economy, and the expectations surrounding the\nfirst tightening. The first tightening in 1994 was not fully anticipated at the time and\nresulted in a fairly sharp increase in long-term rates to a level noticeably above where\nthey ended up later in the normalization process. In contrast, the first tightening in 2004\nappears to have been anticipated and thus did not cause much reaction relative to the rates\nimmediately prior to the tightening or relative to rates later in the normalization process.\nA complication with the present cycle is the presence of unusually low long-term\nrates. With inflation low, global rates low, and large central bank balance sheets, we see\nlong-term rates are below their historical average in many developed countries.\nAssuming inflation does return to 2 percent in the United States, a 10-year Treasury rate\nfluctuating around 2.25 percent is lower than one should expect – unless investors expect\na negative real after-tax return on average over the next 10 years. This implies that there\nwill need to be some upward adjustment in long-term rates during the normalization\nprocess.\nWhile conventional wisdom is that a cycle of tightening monetary policy is bad\nfor the stock market, Figure 10 shows that has not been true during the past two\ntightening cycles. In part, this is because in those cases the tightening was initiated\nbecause the Fed assessed that there was sufficient strength in the underlying economy to\njustify tightening. As it turned out, their assessment was about right, so the tighter\nmonetary policy did not derail the economy. However, currently it is worth noting that\nthere already has been a significant improvement in stock prices, and interest rates have\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbeen unusually low as a result of the depressed economic conditions following the\nfinancial crisis – so the pattern of the previous two tightenings might not be repeated this\ntime.\nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility did not increase significantly in the\npast two periods of normalization. As measured by the Chicago Board Options\nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of monetary policy normalization\nhave been periods of relatively low volatility. High volatility of stock markets tends to\noccur during periods preceding or during recessions rather than when the economy is\nstrengthening and monetary policy rates are rising.\n\nConcluding Observations\nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prevails as the Federal Reserve considers\nbeginning a move toward more normal rates. Both short-term and long-term rates are\nunusually low, and remain below their historical average in most countries. Large central\nbank balance sheets – here and in many developed countries – and very low inflation\nrates in developed countries are important contributors to current low rates. Also, unlike\nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while others will likely be\ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-rate dynamics. These are all factors that\ncomplicate the period of normalization.\nThe low inflation rates experienced globally may also allow for a more gradual\nnormalization process than typically occurs. With so little wage and price pressure, and\nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is possible that rates may not normalize at the\nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced\nthan in 1994 and 2004. However, as I noted at the outset of my remarks, the fact that\ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from\ndiscussions of monetary policy over the past six years.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nNote that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate\ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent”\n2\n\nThe statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm\nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to\nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”\n\n11\n\n\f",

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRemarks at a Panel Discussion on\n“Monetary Policy Normalization: Graceful\nExit or Bumpy Ride?”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNational Association for Business Economics /\nAmerican Economic Association Meetings\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJanuary 3, 2015\n\nI am happy to be participating on today’s panel, especially since the topic is\nmonetary policy normalization. At the AEA’s annual meetings since 2008, my sense is\nthat monetary policy discussions have not had the word “normal” in the title. It is a\npleasure to be seeing the types of economic conditions where such a discussion is not just\ntheoretical – where the economy has improved enough for the discussion to move from\nwhether normalization will occur to when normalization will occur.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nIn the year just past, the monetary policy environment has been quite stable –\nperhaps surprisingly stable, given the number of significant monetary policy events that\ntranspired. Over the past year, we have seen new leadership at the Fed, in both a new\nChair and Vice Chair. The Committee wound down and ended its bond purchase\nprogram, and provided a revised exit strategy. The FOMC has also shifted the FOMC\nstatement from providing forward guidance tied to labor market outcomes1 to a “patient”\npolicy that is not time dependent.2\nThis all occurred in the context of a falling unemployment rate, a below-target\ninflation rate, a rising stock market, and falling long-term interest rates. As the second\npart of the title to this session suggests – “Graceful Exit or Bumpy Ride” – such good\nfortune cannot, of course, be automatically assumed for the coming year.\nAny change in policy, monetary or otherwise, has the potential for unanticipated\neffects. In assessing the potential consequences of a patient monetary policy response,\nfor example, some observers worry that such a policy entails significant risks of\novershooting full employment, overheating financial markets, or even causing\nundesirably high inflation. I would note, however, that the last time the FOMC raised\nrates after a recession in June of 2004, the unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent, below\nour current 5.8 percent, and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation was at\n2.8 percent, well above its current reading of 1.2 percent. Some worry that patience will\nmean deferring the first rate increase until well past the arrival of economic conditions\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat historically result in tightening, but I would point out that we have some way to go\nbefore reaching those conditions, and so have not been unusually patient as yet.\nWhile many market participants are understandably concerned about the exact\ntiming of a rate liftoff, it is important to recall that economic forecasts are imperfect and\npredictions of turning points are particularly imprecise. While we would all like to know\nwhen the liftoff will occur, it is not possible to predict the relevant economic conditions\nwith enough precision to pinpoint the point in time at which a data-driven liftoff will be\nappropriate. Furthermore, while market participants worry about whether liftoff will\noccur in April, June, or August, in fact most models imply that the macroeconomic\nimplications of such differences are quite small. Indeed, such circumstances remind us\nthat monetary policy can be as much art as science.\nAs such, there are a few key questions to consider at this juncture: Is the\neconomy clearly on a sustainable path to full employment and the 2 percent inflation\ntarget? Will that path be sustained as policy accommodation is removed? Can we be\nquite confident that the risks to the forecast will not materialize and perhaps result in a\nneed to reverse policy, particularly considering the policy challenges when short-term\nrates are bounded by zero?\nAs I consider these questions for this cycle, I believe the continued very low core\ninflation and wage growth numbers provide ample justification for patience. A patient\napproach to policy is prudent until we can more confidently expect that inflation will\nreturn to the Fed’s 2 percent target over the next several years. Such patience also\nprovides support to labor markets, boosting the prospects of the many Americans who\nwere adversely impacted by the financial crisis, severe recession, and slow recovery.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nToday I would like to discuss how I think about a so-called “exit strategy” in the\ncontext of a patient monetary policy. I will first compare current economic conditions to\nthe conditions prevalent at the time of the last two rate liftoffs following recessions. I\nwill then discuss some of the differences that may make an exit from accommodative\nmonetary policy more complicated this time compared with the previous two economic\nrecoveries. I will then discuss the impact of previous liftoffs on economic and financial\nvariables and what that history may portend as normalization becomes appropriate in the\nUnited States this time.\n\nConsidering U.S. Economic Conditions at Tightening\nThe timing of the initial tightening of short-term interest rates after a recession\ndepends on several factors, including the position of the economy relative to the Fed’s\nmandated goals of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, the speed at\nwhich the economy is likely to reach these mandated goals, and the likelihood that the\nrecovery is sufficiently vigorous that removing accommodation will not undermine that\nprogress. Because of the complicated interactions of these and other factors, and the\ndifficulty associated with economic forecasting, I would argue that previous liftoffs can\nprovide only an imperfect guide to likely future actions – but do provide some indication\nof factors that should be considered.\nFigure 1 shows the unemployment rate with vertical lines indicating February\n1994 and June 2004, the months when the first rate increase occurred after the recessions\nof 1990-91 and 2001 respectively (shaded in gray).

In both 1994 and 2004, the\nfirst interest rate increase occurred sometime after the unemployment rate had begun to\ndecline, and in both instances, the unemployment rate continued to decline after that\ninitial tightening, with the onset of tightening having no perceptible effect on the steady\nimprovement in labor markets.\nFigure 2 uses another indicator of the strength of labor markets: the growth in\npayroll employment.

With third-quarter real GDP growth of\n5 percent (2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis) and the likelihood of above-potential\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter, the economy appears to be growing at a pace that is\nlikely to foster continued improvement in labor markets.\nFigure 5 contains a measure of compensation growth: the employment cost index.\nGiven the improving economy, this index has been growing more slowly than one might\nexpect, and also well below the experience at the time of the two previous tightenings.\nGiven modest increases in productivity and a 2 percent inflation target, we would\nnormally expect more rapid growth in compensation in a steadily improving labor\nmarket.\nFigure 6 shows another important distinction between current conditions and\nconditions around the start of the two previous interest rate increases.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbeen unusually low as a result of the depressed economic conditions following the\nfinancial crisis – so the pattern of the previous two tightenings might not be repeated this\ntime.\nFigure 11 shows that stock market volatility did not increase significantly in the\npast two periods of normalization. As measured by the Chicago Board Options\nExchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), both periods of monetary policy normalization\nhave been periods of relatively low volatility. High volatility of stock markets tends to\noccur during periods preceding or during recessions rather than when the economy is\nstrengthening and monetary policy rates are rising.\n\nConcluding Observations\nClearly, an unusual set of conditions prevails as the Federal Reserve considers\nbeginning a move toward more normal rates. Both short-term and long-term rates are\nunusually low, and remain below their historical average in most countries. Large central\nbank balance sheets – here and in many developed countries – and very low inflation\nrates in developed countries are important contributors to current low rates. Also, unlike\nin some previous periods, some countries will be easing while others will likely be\ntightening, causing more complicated exchange-rate dynamics. These are all factors that\ncomplicate the period of normalization.\nThe low inflation rates experienced globally may also allow for a more gradual\nnormalization process than typically occurs. With so little wage and price pressure, and\nrelatively slow productivity growth, it is possible that rates may not normalize at the\nsame level they were prior to the financial crisis.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL January 3, 2015 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, the complexity of monetary policy normalization is more pronounced\nthan in 1994 and 2004. However, as I noted at the outset of my remarks, the fact that\ndiscussion of policy normalization is now appropriate is a welcome change from\ndiscussions of monetary policy over the past six years.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nNote that the January 2014 FOMC statement still had the phrase, “that it likely will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate\ndeclines below 6-1/2 percent”\n2\n\nThe statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20141217a.htm\nnotes that “Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to\nnormalize the stance of monetary policy.”\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWashington and Lee University’s H. Parker Willis\nLecture in Political Economy\nLexington, Virginia\nNovember 10, 2014\n\nIt is a great pleasure to visit Washington and Lee University and have this\nopportunity to talk to students and faculty about the economy and monetary policy. The\nFederal Reserve places a high value on transparency and public understanding, so I am\npleased to be able to share some insights into our work with you today.\nI should note, of course, that the H. Parker Willis lecture in political economy is\nnamed for a distinguished representative of Washington and Lee and a leader in the\nfounding of the Federal Reserve System, as colleagues like Ben Bernanke have noted\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfrom this stage. Willis served on the National Monetary Commission, which\nrecommended the creation of the Federal Reserve. And he served as research director at\nthe Federal Reserve from 1918 to 1922.1\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nOne of the consequences that many central banks around the world have had to\nface since battling a severe recession in conjunction with the financial crisis of 2008 is an\ninflation rate that is too low rather than too high. Even though the U.S. economy has\nbeen improving and the FOMC ended its asset-purchase program last month, we have\nconsistently and persistently undershot the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target\nsince the financial crisis.\nTo many of you, the idea that inflation could be “too low” may seem puzzling.\nWhy would it be desirable to push the inflation rate up from its current rate of 1.4\npercent2 to something a bit higher? Today I want to talk about the costs of an inflation\nrate that is too low, and thus why it is important that our inflation target be viewed as\n“symmetric” – meaning the Federal Reserve must respond as vigorously to inflation that\nis too low as we have, historically, when inflation has been too high. I will then suggest\nthat monetary policymakers should remain patient about removing accommodation until\nit is clear that we are on the path to achieving both our 2 percent inflation target and\nmaximum sustainable employment.\nIt may seem counterintuitive to say that too low an inflation rate is problematic, so\nlet me describe why this situation can be so costly. My first concern with very low\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ninflation rates is that when the starting point is very low inflation, an unexpected\nweakening of the economy could push inflation down even further, into a situation of\noutright deflation – that is, a fall in the overall level of prices in the economy. When\nhouseholds and firms expect that prices in the future will be lower than they are at\npresent, they tend to postpone expenditures, awaiting the lower prices. Historically,\nunder such circumstances, economic activity has tended to remain depressed.\nIn addition to spending effects, deflation is particularly problematic for debtors.\nThe real value of their loan payments rises over time, making it more difficult to make\nrepayment.\nFor a real-life example, the long period of mild deflation that Japan just faced was\nalso a period of slow growth in the Japanese economy. Only recently, with strong policy\nactions taken by the Japanese central bank, has positive inflation been achieved in Japan.\nSimilarly, there are growing concerns by some that Europe, too, could experience mild\ndeflation.\nAnother concern is that very low inflation rates are typically accompanied by very\nlow interest rates. Because nominal interest rates can’t go below zero, when inflation and\ninterest rates are already quite low, monetary policy has only limited room to further\nlower interest rates to offset negative shocks to the economy. Another way of thinking\nabout this is that an economy with significant slack may need very low real interest rates\nto return with any speed to full employment. If the short-term inflation rate is close to\nzero, it’s hard to push real interest rates much below zero. Estimates of the costs\nassociated with the zero lower bound before 2007 now seem too low. Japan’s experience\nseems to corroborate that view.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs a recent case in point, nominal short-term interest rates have been close to\nzero since the fall of 2008 (as Figure 1 shows), leading the Federal Reserve to use less\ntraditional monetary policy actions to counteract the significant slack in the economy.\nNecessary labor market adjustments can be more difficult in a very low inflation\nenvironment as well. Consider some of the nuances of labor markets, as economists view\nthem. Although not conclusive, there is significant evidence that workers and firms\nappear to resist outright declines in nominal wages – economists call this “downward\nnominal wage rigidity.” During recessions, when demand for workers falls, real wages\nneed to fall to help reduce (that is, employ) the excess supply of labor. But with wage\ninflation near zero and resistance to pay cuts, a reduction in real wages must primarily\ntake place through rising prices. In a very weak economy with low inflation, the\nlikelihood that rising prices will produce the necessary reduction in real wages is slim.\nThus, the combination of low inflation and downward nominal wage rigidity likely make\nrecovery from recessions, especially a recovery in the labor market, more protracted and\npainful.\nFinally, failing to achieve a clearly stated inflation target can undermine the\ncredibility of a central bank. Confidence that a central bank can achieve its goals helps to\nkeep expectations well anchored. Failure to achieve these goals can cause expectations\nabout inflation to become unstable. In particular, persistently undershooting the inflation\ngoal could cause expectations about future prices to drift down, bringing along any\nrealized inflation with them, and thus making it even more difficult to push inflation back\nto its 2 percent target.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe significant costs associated with low as well as high inflation explain why the\nFOMC has set a 2 percent inflation target. It is a symmetric target in that persistent\ndeviations in either direction should generate a monetary policy response.\nBoth core and total PCE inflation are currently running somewhat below our 2\npercent target. Moreover, in the short-term, falling oil prices and other commodity prices\n– as well as the appreciation of the dollar and slow wage growth – are likely to prevent\nmuch progress in returning to our 2 percent inflation target.\nThese economic conditions should allow monetary policymakers to remain\npatient in removing accommodation. I would also note that such patience provides the\nopportunity to better determine how much labor market slack remains, above and beyond\nthe widely reported unemployment rate.\n\nInflation Forecasts\nMany forecasters expected that as labor market slack – meaning unemployed,\nunderemployed, or discouraged workers, for example; not to mention those who have\nstopped participating in the formal labor market – declined and was eventually\neliminated, the 2 percent inflation target would be achieved. Figure 2 shows the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) forecasts for PCE inflation and core PCE\ninflation in 2014, made from June 2012 through September 2014. At the time of the June\n2012 FOMC meeting, the median forecast of FOMC participants predicted that both PCE\nand core PCE inflation rates would be at almost 2 percent by the end of 2014. However,\nas the chart shows, the forecast for 2014 inflation has been gradually declining. As of the\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmost recent SEP outlook, the forecasted 2014 inflation rate is not far from the 1.4 percent\ninflation rate that we have had over the past year.\nThe SEP has not been the only forecast that is too optimistic about how quickly\nthe 2 percent inflation goal would be achieved. Private sector forecasts have also been\ntoo confident about returning to the target. As you can see in Figure 3, the median\nforecast from the Survey of Professional Forecasters in May 2012 actually anticipated\nthat total PCE for 2014 would be above the 2 percent inflation target. However, as\nincoming inflation data have consistently fallen short of 2 percent, the Survey forecasters,\ntoo, have been lowering their forecast for 2014 inflation.\nGiven the normal forecasting errors for predicting PCE and core PCE inflation, a\nmiss of half a percent is not that unusual. However, a little more surprising has been how\npersistently we have been undershooting both inflation expectations and our inflation\ntarget, particularly as the unemployment rate has fallen more than expected.\nOne possibility for why we have been missing on the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\ninflation target could be that there remains significant labor market slack. Figure 4\nshows that the typical, widely reported measure of unemployment, also known as the “U3” measure, is currently at 5.8 percent. While this is still above my own forecast of full\nemployment – 5.25 percent – there may be even more slack in the labor market than is\ncaptured in U-3. For example, a broader measure of unemployment called the “U-6,”\nwhich includes workers who are part time for economic reasons and workers who are\nmarginally attached to the labor force, still remains elevated. While U-6 has fallen\nsignificantly from its peak after the last recession, this measure is still greater today than\nit was at its peak following the prior recession.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 5 plots the gap between the unemployment rate and the so-called natural\nrate of unemployment, and the change in the core CPI inflation rate from three years\nearlier – for each quarter since 1980.3 The periods when the gap is positive are periods\nwhen the unemployment rate is higher than the unemployment rate at which the economy\nis considered at full employment. One of the largest gaps was experienced following the\nfinancial crisis, as the figure shows.\nDuring periods when the gap is wide, the inflation rate tends to fall over\ntime. This negative correlation is an imperfect indicator of inflation changes. However,\nit does highlight that slack in the economy tends to place downward pressure on the\ninflation rate over time, which is one reason to expect that as the U.S. economy returns to\nfull employment we may gradually return to our 2 percent inflation target.\nFigures 2 and 3 showed that expectations for 2014 inflation have declined, and\nwith inflation having consistently undershot the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, it is\npossible that longer-term inflation expectations are starting to decline as well. Figure 6\nprovides one way to capture longer-run inflation expectations. By subtracting the 10year inflation-indexed Treasury yield (TIPS) from the 10-year Treasury yield, you get a\nmeasure of so-called “break-even” inflation. That is, this difference represents the\nprevailing inflation rate that should make you indifferent between holding a fixed-rate\nbond and holding a Treasury bond of the same maturity that floats with the inflation rate.\nThe latest readings have been at the low end of recent experience. However, one must be\ncautious to infer too much from Treasury interest rates, particularly given the recent\nvolatility and the “flight to quality” by many global investors that may have temporarily\nreduced Treasury yields.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 7 provides a measure of inflation expectations from survey data. The\nsurvey data have not shown the same decline and look little changed from previous\nperiods.\nHowever, it is also possible that temporary supply shocks rather than changes in\nthe labor markets or inflation expectations can explain the low rates. I will say more\nabout this in a moment.\n\nFactors Influencing Recent Measures of U.S. Inflation\nFigure 8 provides the recent movement of oil prices, as measured by West Texas\nIntermediate crude. As you can see, oil prices have recently fallen below $80 a barrel.\nThis chart also shows that oil prices are quite volatile. That is one reason to focus on\ncore PCE inflation – not because oil prices are not important, but because oil can be so\nvolatile that its fluctuations may not aid in our understanding the overall movement of\nprices in the aggregate.\nHowever, as Figure 9 illustrates, domestic production of oil has increased. Some\nof the recent decline in oil prices may reflect the expansions of drilling practices that\nhave increased the supply of oil. This may result in recent oil price declines persisting\nfor some time. Nonetheless, the price movements of one commodity, oil, suggest a\nreason to focus more on core measures of inflation.\nFigure 10 illustrates that many other commodity prices have also been falling.\nThe slowing of economic growth among many of our trading partners has reduced the\ndemand for a variety of commodities. This has depressed other material prices, and has\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\noccurred at a time when relatively plentiful harvests have resulted in declines in many\nagricultural prices.\nFigure 11 shows that the exchange rate for the dollar has appreciated, given that\nthe U.S. economy has grown more rapidly than the economies of many of our trading\npartners. In general, this reduces the price of imported goods, placing a temporary\ndownward pressure on inflation.4\nFigure 12 provides the employment cost index by broad occupational categories.\nWhile there clearly are specialized skills that are experiencing significant increases in\nwages and salaries, it is striking to see no substantial increases in any particular broad\ncategory.\nFigure 13 shows the employment cost index by the four main regions in the\nUnited States. While particular states with a concentration in oil production have\nexperienced very low unemployment rates and rising wages and salaries, the broader\nregional patterns do not show much evidence of a pickup in wages and salaries.\n\nGlobal Inflation Patterns\nFigure 14 shows that Japan, the United States, and Europe have all been\nundershooting their inflation targets. Japan has been able to achieve positive inflation\nafter a long period of mild deflation by taking aggressive monetary policy action, yet it\nstill remains below its stated inflation target of 2 percent (when adjusted for the April\n2014 increase in the consumption tax).5 European inflation rates have continued to\ndecline, and combined with very weak economic growth, have raised concerns among\nsome observers that the Eurozone could experience mild deflation as well.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, while the United States is only somewhat below the 2 percent inflation\ntarget, the challenges currently faced by other central banks indicate that we should not\nbe complacent about persistently missing our inflation target.\nFigure 15 shows short-term interest rates in Japan, Europe, and the United States.\nAs weak economic growth and low inflation during the recovery from the recession\nprompted expansionary monetary policy responses, all three central banks kept shortterm rates at the zero lower bound, leading to the use of less traditional monetary policies\nto stimulate growth and attempt a return to inflation targets.\nFigure 16 highlights how low 10-year Treasury rates have fallen recently.\nJapan’s experience and now Europe’s current situation both indicate that indifference to\nvery low inflation rates can generate a significant loss of confidence in the ability of a\ncentral bank to hit its inflation goal. It is hard to reconcile the market evidence – a 10year German bond trading around 85 basis points and a 10-year Japanese bond trading\nbelow 50 basis points – with the publicly announced inflation targets. Bond market\nevidence suggests that investors have little expectation that 10-year average inflation\nrates will be anywhere close to their publicly announced targets.\nBy the way, these low long-term nominal rates also suggest the relatively limited\nimpact that non-traditional expansionary monetary policies can have on lowering longterm borrowing rates in these countries – when long rates are already close to zero it is\nnot possible to lower the rates much more, because they cannot be negative. This is\nanother reason for worrying about and wanting to avoid protracted periods of low\ninflation and slow growth.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 10, 2014 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would observe that many central banks around the\nworld have persistently missed their stated inflation targets. Experience in Japan and\nEurope increasingly indicate that it can be costly to be complacent when inflation gets too\nlow. While recent inflation rates in the United States have been higher than in many\ndeveloped economies, it is still important for the Federal Reserve to achieve the 2 percent\ntarget it has set for itself.\nA variety of recent positive supply shocks (e.g. to oil) are likely to result in\nreported inflation rates remaining well below the target. Distinguishing short-term\nfluctuations in inflation from longer-run trends is not always straightforward. However,\nuntil there is stronger evidence that inflation will return to 2 percent – versus a repeated\nforecast that it will – I believe monetary policymakers should remain patient about\nremoving accommodation.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm\n\n2\n\nOr 1.5 percent using the Core PCE or the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index\nexcluding food and energy.\n\n3\n\nFigure 5 uses the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment\nwhich is an estimate of the unemployment rate at which the economy is considered at full\nemployment.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGlobal Banking Standards and Regulatory and\nSupervisory Priorities in the Americas*\nLima, Peru\nNovember 5, 2014\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank Josef Tosovsky, chairman of the Financial\nStability Institute of the Bank for International Settlements, for inviting me to this forum\nto discuss financial stability issues. The Financial Stability Institute serves an important\nrole, increasing awareness of financial stability issues and highlighting actions being\ntaken around the world to address some of the weaknesses that became all too apparent\nduring the financial crisis.\n\n*\n\nOrganized by the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas, the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision, and the Financial Stability Institute.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs I begin, I would note as I always do that the views I will express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nLet me begin by saying that actions taken to bolster the stability and resilience of\nthe financial infrastructure have frequently focused on the banking system. In the United\nStates, for example, significant increases in bank capital ratios and important changes in\nthe supervisory process have occurred – steps that put an emphasis on understanding\ncapital and liquidity conditions that would occur during stressful situations. I would\nargue that one of the most important innovations in bank supervision has been the\nestablishment of credible stress tests.\nIn terms of preparing better for possible stress conditions, supervisors have made\nsignificant progress with organizations focused on traditional deposit-taking and lending\nactivities. However, there is more work to be done with financial organizations — firms\nthat engage in bank-like activities outside the conventional banking system — that have\nless traditional business models, especially in their sources of funding. Particular concern\nhas been raised by Federal Reserve officials on the reliance by some financial institutions\non short-term wholesale funding.1\nShort-term wholesale funding has been particularly important for firms with large\nbroker-dealer activities. Given their role in making markets, broker-dealers hold an\ninventory of securities. These securities holdings frequently are financed by\ncollateralized borrowing commonly called repurchase agreements or “repos.” A repo, in\nthis context, would involve a broker-dealer (the cash borrower) selling a security (the\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncollateral) to an investor (the cash provider) with an agreement to repurchase the security\nat a later time. Repos have very short maturities, usually overnight.2\nThere are three parts of the repo market – first the Tri-Party market, where repos\nare intermediated by two large U.S. “clearing banks”; secondly the General Collateral\nFinance or GCF market, where broker-dealers finance “general collateral”; and thirdly\nthe bilateral market, where parties engage in repos without an intermediary.\nPrior to the recent financial crisis, many had assumed that repurchase agreements\nwould be stable during stressful conditions because they are collateralized with a margin\nto cushion possible fluctuations in the price of the underlying collateral. Unfortunately, a\nlesson learned from the financial crisis was that this important form of short-term\nwholesale funding was actually not nearly as stable as many had expected.\nToday I will discuss the experience of short-term wholesale funding during the\ncrisis. I will then explore why the movement of many broker-dealers into domestic\nholding companies does not obviate the concern over the potentially adverse financial\nstability risks of short-term wholesale funding. Finally, I will discuss related regulatory\nreporting requirements, and argue that greater disclosure of the maturity and collateral\nused in wholesale funding arrangements will enable investors and analysts to better\nunderstand, and make more informed pricing decisions with respect to, a borrower’s “run\nrisk.” I will suggest that this greater disclosure would be useful at the legal entity level of\nthe broker-dealer, as well as at the bank holding company level.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nShort-Term Wholesale Funding During the Financial Crisis\nThe assets of broker-dealers grew quite dramatically during the period leading up\nto the financial crisis, as did broker-dealers’ use of repurchase agreements to finance\nthose assets.3 Figure 1 shows that between 2000 and 2007, both broker-dealer assets and\nthe use of repurchase agreements increased by over 150 percent. While broker-dealer\nassets increased rapidly over the seven-year period, the decline in the wake of the\nLehman Brothers failure was precipitous.\nFigure 2 highlights that problems within Lehman Brothers were troublesome well\nbefore the middle of September 2008 – based on information from the bankruptcy\nexaminer’s report. In the three-month period between May 30 and August 29 of 2008,\nthere was a significant funding runoff underway from multiple sources of short-term\nwholesale funding – particularly involving Lehman Brothers’ repurchase-agreement and\nderivatives counterparties.\nFigure 3 shows the dramatic decline in Lehman Brothers’ repurchase agreement\nfinancing in the Tri-Party repo market as concerns about a failure became more\nimminent. While declines in repurchase agreements had already occurred in July –\nparticularly for repurchase agreements secured by non-U.S. Treasury security collateral –\nthe withdrawal of repurchase financing became quite acute for Lehman Brothers in the\nfinal week before its bankruptcy filing.\nFigure 4 shows the aggregate decline in repurchase agreements collateralized by\nsecurities not guaranteed by the government4 for the entire Tri-Party repurchase market.\nDuring the second half of 2008, this market dropped from approximately $600 billion to\n$300 billion. (Please note that the chart only includes the Tri-Party repurchase market\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand does not include the bilateral repurchase market.) Not surprisingly, the disruption of\nfinancing for collateral not guaranteed by the federal government exacerbated the\nfinancing difficulties occurring across many different types of financial instruments as\nthe crisis worsened.\nUnfortunately, no comprehensive public data source exists for the entire\nrepurchase agreement market by broker-dealer. Aggregated information on the Tri-Party\nand GCF repo market is published periodically, but there is little information on bilateral\nrepos.5, 6 Thus, even the estimates of the size of the entire U.S. repo market require some\nassumptions. Still, economists at the New York Federal Reserve Bank have provided an\nestimate of the size of the entire market in 2014.\nFigure 5 provides their estimates of the composition of the market. Tri-Party and\nGCF repo activity accounts for about one-half of the overall repurchase agreement\nmarket. However, we do not have other estimates for all of the various components of\nthe entire market – or good estimates of what is held by particular broker-dealers. I will\nsay more in a moment about this lack of comprehensive public data on the market.\nWhat is clear is that the events of 2008 present ample reason to have concerns\nabout short-term wholesale funding. The problems caused by reduced financing extend\nwell beyond broker-dealers. Faced with funding problems, many broker-dealers sold\nsecurities under duress at fire-sale prices – causing collateral problems for other buyers\nand sellers of securities.\nAs previously noted, broker-dealers rely on short-term wholesale funding to\nfinance their securities inventory. During the crisis, the largest U.S broker-dealers (i.e.,\nthose affiliated with investment banks) either became bank holding companies or were\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nacquired by bank holding companies. Additionally, many of the other largest brokerdealers are owned by foreign bank holding companies, and soon will be required to form\nintermediate bank holding companies. Only a few remaining large broker-dealers are not\npart of either a domestic or foreign bank holding company.7\nThat said, I would now like to discuss why being part of a bank holding company\ndoes not obviate wholesale financing concerns.\n\nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies\nSome may assume that broker-dealer runs should not be a concern, now that most\nof the largest broker-dealers are in bank holding companies. However, it is important to\nnote that, to protect depositors and the financial well-being of banks, there has\nhistorically been an array of bank laws and regulations designed to, among other things,\nensure bank liquidity – and these longstanding laws and regulations place significant\nrestrictions on the ability of a bank to fund liquidity problems or other activities of its\nnonbank affiliates or the nonbank subsidiaries of its bank holding company. In addition,\nthe Dodd-Frank legislation has made it even more difficult for banks to fund their\nnonbank affiliates, even during periods of financial stress.\nThe Federal Reserve has legal authority to provide loans to banks facing liquidity\nproblems but not solvency issues.8 These so-called Section 10(b) or “discount window”\nloans are available to the banks, but not to the holding company parent or nonbank\nsubsidiaries.\nDuring the financial crisis, many nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies\nand nonbank financial institutions had significant liquidity problems.9 Section 13(3) of\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe Federal Reserve Act allows the Federal Reserve to lend to nonbanks under “exigent\ncircumstances.” Commonly referred to as its “lender of last resort” authority, that section\nenabled the Federal Reserve to take emergency measures and extend loans to nonbanks,\nsuch as broker-dealers that acted as primary dealers for the Federal Reserve, during the\ncrisis.\nWhile lending facilities made available to broker-dealers significantly mitigated\nproblems with broker-dealer financing flows that were contributing to the crisis, such\nfunding authority is now subject to additional limitations. In particular, the Dodd-Frank\nAct10 now requires that Federal Reserve facilities or lending programs have broad-based\neligibility and be designed to provide liquidity to the financial system (not assist just one\nindividual firm). The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits the use of such facilities by firms\nthat are insolvent and requires that such facilities be approved by Treasury.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank legislation encourages supervisory actions that would\nprevent the need for future 13(3) lending facilities to be established at all. That is,\nnonbank affiliates of bank holding companies and financial firms that are not banks\nshould have the capacity to fund themselves through stressful situations without the\nexpectation of resorting to Federal Reserve emergency powers. In addition, the likely\nintent of the legislation is to ensure that such institutions do not take on excessive risk\ntoday based on an assumption that subsequent severe losses will be backstopped by Fed\nlending.\nIn addition to the limitations on the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending that I\nhave noted, there are also other statutory rules and regulations designed to protect banks,\nbut not nonbank affiliates, as shown in Figure 6. For example, Sections 23A and 23B of\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe Federal Reserve Act are intended to protect the bank so that neither a bank nor the\nFDIC deposit insurance fund suffers losses from transactions between a bank and its\nnonbank affiliates. A bank’s extensions of credit to and purchases of assets from any one\naffiliate are limited to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus.11 In addition,\nbank transactions with affiliates need to be done at market terms.12 These laws are\nintended to prevent the bank from being exposed to losses at, or caused by, nonbank\naffiliates.13\nDuring the crisis, the Federal Reserve granted temporary exemptions from\nSection 23A restrictions, to facilitate the borrowing needs of unaffiliated market\nparticipants.14 In addition, exemptions from the quantitative limits, collateral\nrequirements, and restrictions on “low-quality” asset purchases were granted to banks in\nSeptember of 2008.15 However, as previously mentioned, the Dodd-Frank Act was\nintended to further restrict some of the precedents and emergency powers lawfully used\nduring the crisis. In particular, the FDIC must now concur with any such exemptions,\nand the FDIC may object to the granting of an exemption if the exemption would present\nan unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.16 Again, these restrictions highlight\nthe need to take actions in normal times, to avoid such exemptions ever being needed in\nthe future.\nFinally, there has historically been an expectation that bank holding companies\nmust serve as a “source of strength” to their bank subsidiaries. This was further codified\nin the Dodd-Frank Act.17 Thus, a bank holding company’s support of a nonbank\nsubsidiary would be limited by its primary obligation to support its bank subsidiaries.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOverall, the legislation that was designed to protect banks pre-crisis, and the\nfurther limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, pose significant impediments to\nfuture funding of broker-dealers by the Federal Reserve or their affiliated bank should\nthey experience a run. These impediments make it imperative that preventive measures\nbe taken to ensure that in future crises, broker-dealers’ financing mechanisms are robust\nenough to endure potential financial stress. And clearly there should not be an\nexpectation that such runs could necessarily be addressed through the bank holding\ncompany structure.\n\nThe Need for More Disclosure on Balance Sheet Items that are Susceptible to Runs\nBoth the significant reduction in repurchase agreement financing during the crisis\nand the difficulty in addressing runs through the bank holding company structure provide\na significant motivation for taking appropriate preventive actions. Specifically, Federal\nReserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and Chair Janet Yellen have suggested regulatory\nmeasures such as additional capital charges for banks that house significant short-term\nwholesale funding operations.\nWhile these additional regulatory measures are important, to date there has not\nbeen a significant focus on public and more timely disclosure of broker-dealers’\nfinancing activities. Disclosure has the potential to provide better information on the\ndegree of reliance on repurchase agreements – particularly repurchase agreements\ninvolving collateral not guaranteed by the federal government – to the institutions’\nstakeholders interested in the extent of its risk-taking, such as holders of its long-term\ndebt. Because of the lack of comprehensive disclosure requirements in place at the time\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof the crisis, neither the significant ramp-up in the use of repurchase agreements nor the\nmovement to repos that were backed by less secure collateral were obvious to investors.18\nLet me recognize that disclosure is not a standalone cure-all. It has the potential\nto be an important supplement to other important actions, like capital requirements.\nFigure 7 shows the line items typically included on the public forms filed by\nbroker-dealers on an annual basis (the SEC’s so-called FOCUS Report, Part III).19 Given\nthat broker-dealers played a key role in the crisis, and are often very large institutions, it\nmay be appropriate to consider whether more complete disclosures by broker-dealers\nwould better leverage the role of investors and analysts in providing additional market\ndiscipline. Such discipline requires more transparency and frequency of data reporting\nthan is occurring currently.\nIn particular, given the emphasis on run risks at broker-dealers, it would be useful\nto have far more detailed publicly available data on repurchase agreements used to\nfinance broker-dealers and related affiliates.20 However, for more transparency to be\nbeneficial, the right information needs to be disclosed. Information – such as repo\ncollateral composition (for example, U.S. Treasury, private collateralized mortgage\nobligations), haircuts, the counterparty, and maturity structure – reported in a timely\nmanner, would provide investors an opportunity to observe changes in financing patterns,\nand might prevent management from taking risks that its investors may deem excessive.\nHad such information been available prior to the crisis, the reliance on short-term\nfunding based on both government and nongovernment collateral (the latter meaning\ncollateral not guaranteed by the federal government) would have been apparent and might\nhave resulted in greater market discipline than we saw leading up to the crisis.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile bank holding companies report far more detail than is found in the FOCUS\nreports, their disclosures likewise include only limited detail on repurchase agreements.\nBank holding companies’ reliance on short-term wholesale funding indicates that further\ndetail on repurchase collateral and maturities at the consolidated bank holding company\nlevel would also be useful. In addition, because of the potential for “window dressing,”\nhaving quarterly peak and average information as well as end of quarter information on\nthese positions would be helpful. However, such detail would not cover broker-dealers\nthat are not currently part of bank holding companies – which is why the legal entity\ndetail in the FOCUS reports would be particularly important.\nWork has begun to look for opportunities to provide more detail on short-term\nwholesale funding in bank holding company reports. I am hoping that this effort will\ndevelop sufficient detail on collateral type and maturity structure so that risks in this\nmarket can be better assessed, going forward.\n\nConcluding Observations\nDuring the financial crisis a large number of broker-dealers either failed, were\nacquired, formed bank holding companies, or needed support from parent companies.\nThese problems occurred despite the significant intervention to support broker-dealers\nthat was provided during the crisis, in order to restore credit flows in the financial\ninfrastructure.\nA key element of the problems was the over-reliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nToday I have discussed why potential runs on large broker-dealers may be\ndifficult to preclude or offset, even if the broker-dealer is in a bank holding company.\nThe clear intent of the myriad regulations on bank holding companies and banks is to\nprotect the banks and prevent bank support for affiliated nonbank subsidiaries (like\nbroker-dealers) in the bank’s holding company at the expense of the bank. This\nhighlights the need for additional actions to limit the likelihood of future problems or\ncrises that could require government interventions.\nAs noted previously, a significant capital charge on short-term wholesale funding\nwould certainly help. In addition, much greater disclosure on “runnable” liabilities would\nutilize the power of markets to help curb unhealthy levels of reliance on such funding.\nMore detailed reporting requirements should include more disclosures on both the\ncollateral composition and maturity structure of repurchase agreements.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today about the lessons of the\ncrisis and the as-yet unfinished work of preventing future problems – in part by\naddressing short-term wholesale funding risks.\n\n1\n\nGovernor Tarullo noted in testimony on September 9, 2014:\n“Federal Reserve staff is currently working on three sets of initiatives to address residual\nshort-term wholesale funding risks. As discussed above, the first is a proposal to incorporate the\nuse of short-term wholesale funding into the risk-based capital surcharge applicable to U.S.\nGSIBs. The second involves proposed modifications to the BCBS's net stable funding ratio\n(NSFR) standard to strengthen liquidity requirements that apply when a bank acts as a provider of\nshort-term funding to other market participants. The third is numerical floors for collateral\nhaircuts in securities financing transactions (SFTs)--including repos and reverse repos, securities\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlending and borrowing, and securities margin lending.”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/tarullo20140909a.htm\nHe also noted on May 3, 2013:\n\"…existing bank and broker-dealer risk-based capital rules do not reflect fully the financial\nstability risks associated with SFTs. Accordingly, higher, generally applicable capital charge\napplied to SFTs might be a useful piece of a complementary set of macroprudential measures,\nthough an indirect measure like a capital charge might have to be quite large to create adequate\nincentive to temper the use of short-term wholesale funding.”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130503a.htm\nChair Yellen noted on July 2, 2014:\n\"… The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate\nexcessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding.\n“… In addition, measures are being undertaken to address some of the potential sources of\ninstability in short-term wholesale funding markets, including reforms to the triparty repo market\nand money market mutual funds – although progress in these areas has, at times, been\nfrustratingly slow.\n\"Additional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short-term wholesale\nfunding markets. Some of these measures – such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of\ncapital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding –\nwould likely apply only to the largest, most complex organizations. Other measures – such as\nminimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities financing\ntransactions – could, at least in principle, apply on a marketwide basis.”\n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140702a.htm]\nShe also noted, on April 15, 2014:\n\"…let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains from\nintroducing further reforms to address short-term wholesale funding risks. In 2010, the Basel\nCommittee assessed the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements\nfor global banks. Factoring in the Basel III capital requirements and the NSFR, the Basel study\nsuggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity requirements would, on net, provide\neconomic benefits, and that benefits would continue to accrue at even higher levels of risk-based\ncapital than are part of Basel III.\n“While it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study provides some\nsupport for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and liquidity standards for large\nbanks than have been adopted so far.\"\n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140415a.htm]\n2\n\nSee the paper by Krishnamurthy et al, “Sizing Up Repo”\n(http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/Publication%201.pdf), which states “Maturities get\ncompressed with the onset of the financial crisis. Figure 4 illustrates the shortening in the\nmaturity structure of repos during the crisis. In 2007, the 99th percentile of maturity (weighted by\nnotional amount) reached 250 business days, but it subsequently shrank to 60 business days in\n2008. The reduction in maturity is consistent with an increased demand for liquidity from cashinvestors, since shorter maturity repo is de-facto more liquid than longer maturity repo.”\nKrishnamurthy et al.’s analysis is limited to MMMFs and securities lending data, which they\nestimate covers more than 50 percent of repo lending that flows into the shadow banking system.\nImportantly, it does not include bilateral repos.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL November 5, 2014 at 9 AM U.S. Eastern Time (and 9 AM in Lima, Peru) OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n3\n\nAs mentioned in the speech text, there are alternative repurchase markets that deal with the\ntransfer of collateral and payment somewhat differently. More detail on these markets is\nprovided by Copeland, Adam, Martin, Antoine, and Michael Walker, “The Tri-Party Repo\nMarket Before the 2010 Reforms,” NY Fed Staff Report no. 477 November 2010.\n\n4\n\nNongovernment securities are those not backed by the full faith and credit of the federal\ngovernment, such as asset-backed securities, private label CMOs, corporate securities, equities,\nmoney market instruments, CDOs, international securities, municipality debt, trust receipts and\nwhole loans. Government-backed securities include Treasury securities, agency securities, and\nagency MBS.\n\n5\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes Tri-Party and FICC GCF Repo information\nmonthly. http://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform_data.html\n\n6\n\nThe Office of Financial Research, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and Securities and\nExchange Commission, recently announced a project to gather information on the bilateral repo\nmarket from industry participants.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConference Address\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 58th Economic\nConference: “Inequality of Economic Opportunity”\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 18, 2014\n\nGood morning, and let me again welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston’s 58th economic conference. This year, our conference focuses on inequality of\neconomic opportunity, with the hope of identifying possible policy remedies.\nWhile income inequality may be a somewhat controversial issue, most people –\neven most economists – agree that equality of opportunity is a worthy goal. Yet society\nhas fallen short in delivering on the goal of equality of opportunity. This conference\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfeatures an intentionally diverse mix of scholars presenting research on a wide range of\ntopics – including measuring inequality of opportunity, barriers to economic opportunity,\nearly childhood intervention, education policy, the effects of geography on opportunity,\nand the effects of unequal opportunity on overall economic performance.\nWhile income inequality is something of a “hot topic” in policy and scholarship\ntoday, the Boston Fed has long been concerned about the economic well-being of all\ncitizens, including low- and moderate-income individuals. Indeed, the issue of income\ninequality was the focus of our Annual Report some 15 years ago.\nTo emphasize our concern with such topics, I would note that this our flagship\neconomic conference series has, over the years, often taken an expanded view of the\nFederal Reserve’s mandate to maximize employment. Conferences have explored issues\nthat determine long-run employment, such as financing public schools (1972), education\nin the 21st century (2002), minority business development (1976), welfare reform (1986),\ninvestment in public infrastructure (1990), and the importance of the full employment\npart of the dual mandate (2013). 1\nAt the Boston Fed, we have a tradition of emphasis on employment and\nunemployment, not just inflation – that is, on both sides of the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate. We have traditionally emphasized promoting maximum sustainable\nemployment as well as stable prices, which the Federal Reserve has defined as 2 percent\ninflation. 2 And as our research conferences and community work demonstrate, we have\nlong been concerned with programs that impact low- and moderate-income individuals.\nThis conference continues with the tradition of examining tools and levers outside of\nmonetary policy that often can more directly help these individuals.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn short, this conference continues the Boston Fed’s long-standing practice of\nemphasizing our duty to advance the maximum well-being of all citizens. Realizing that\nmany of the problems faced by low- and moderate-income citizens are closely related to\nthe economic decline of the cities they live in, in recent years, the Boston Fed has focused\non determining successful policies for revitalization – a process I will tell you about\ntoday.\nAs I begin, I would note, as I always do, that the views I will express today are\nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve’s Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\nOpportunity, in the Context of Local Communities\nThe first day of this conference covered, in some detail, why economic\nopportunities may not be evenly distributed. Conference participants noted, for example,\nthat education from early childhood through college is an expensive proposition, and that\nmany such highly priced opportunities may not be available for those with limited\neconomic resources. Conference participants also discussed why opportunities might\ndiffer depending on parent and family characteristics, which go beyond income and\nwealth, and may be a particular impediment for some subgroups.\nThese impediments can be significant barriers to social mobility, and I expect our\nfirst session today will cover why intergenerational poverty is so prevalent, and why\nindividuals from disadvantaged geographies frequently are unable to progress beyond the\ncircumstances of their local community.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe focus of much of the discussion at this conference thus far has been on people\n– opportunities for people, barriers faced by people, and limited social mobility for\npeople. 3 In my remarks today, I am going to take a somewhat different approach, which\nI believe will help bridge the conversation to the upcoming sessions. Beyond individuals\nand their families, I would like to ask what the impediments are that make it difficult for\nentire communities to escape their disadvantaged pasts. I emphasize communities\nbecause much of the weight in equalizing opportunity is borne at the local level.\nMany New England communities experienced one or more significant negative\neconomic shocks in the past half century – as textile producers, lumber mills, and\nmanufacturing operations that were once the mainstay of many communities declined or\ncompletely disappeared. While it is difficult for individuals to overcome limited\nopportunities, the ability of entire communities to reinvent themselves has become\nincreasingly important as evidence mounts suggesting how important social surroundings\ncan be for individual success.\nUltimately, most of the key services that make up the public infrastructure\nsupporting a healthy economic environment must be provided locally. 4 How well these\nlocal services are provided can vary considerably across communities, which in turn can\nhave a substantial effect on the distribution of opportunities that impact individual\ndevelopment (the opportunities discussed yesterday at this conference). For example,\nmost education in a child’s formative years is provided by local school systems or\nnonprofit agencies, including early childhood education and, if necessary, English for\nspeakers of other languages classes (ESOL). Local delivery also, obviously,\ncharacterizes elementary through high school education.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nBut education is only one of many key services with a strong local component.\nStudies have shown that the educational attainment of a mother is highly correlated with\nthe eventual educational attainment of her children. Most services aimed at helping\nteenage mothers complete high school are provided at the local level, as are other\nservices for single mothers. For another example, programs that aim to reintroduce exoffenders into the workforce – which can be a particularly challenging endeavor – are\nprovided by local communities. Cities with substantial numbers of ex-offenders are often\nparticularly stressed to fund these programs.\nThese are but a few examples of the local delivery of services that can influence\nboth opportunities and outcomes for a community’s citizens.\nImportantly, the quality of these local services depends on the economic\ncircumstances of the broader community. The financial, leadership, and peer resources\navailable can be highly dependent on whether a community is flourishing and effectively\ncoordinating services.\nThe importance of the “community context” reinforces the notion that\nsuccessfully addressing the issue of economic opportunity will increasingly require\ncommunities that are both in good health economically and effective in delivering key\nlocal services. This raises some questions. Have we invested enough time and energy\ninto encouraging communities to flourish? And is local civic and social infrastructure\nsufficient to provide opportunities for individuals to overcome economic barriers?\nToday, I will discuss some of the experience in this regard through the lens of\nsome of the mid-sized cities in Massachusetts. 5 And I will briefly describe actions being\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntaken by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, along with a host of partners, that may be a\npromising model for helping such cities to help themselves.\n\nCan Cities Become “Upwardly Mobile”?\nFigure 1 shows median family income in 2010 dollars for the United States,\nMassachusetts, and the mid-sized cities in Massachusetts. For the mid-sized cities, the\nchart shows median family income for three cities – the city with the highest, median,\nand lowest median family income growth over the roughly 50-year period.\nAs you can see, the median family income in the Massachusetts mid-sized city\nranked in the middle in terms of growth is relatively close to that of the entire United\nStates, with both showing improvement from 1959 to 1999, but then showing a decline\nover the 10 years leading up to the end of our data. However, the cities with the highest\nand lowest median family income growth show sharply divergent outcomes, not unlike\ncharts summarizing the experience of individuals at the two ends of the distribution. The\nmid-sized city with the highest median family income growth of the 33 Massachusetts\nmid-sized cities has shown dramatic gains in family income. In contrast, at the other end\nof the distribution, the city with the lowest median family income growth has shown\ndeclining median family income since 1969.\nFigure 2 suggests how difficult it has been for mid-sized cities to be upwardly\nmobile. The figure shows the 10 mid-sized Massachusetts cities with the lowest median\nincome at the end of each decade since 1959. If mid-sized cities were upwardly mobile,\nwe would expect to see successful cities dropping off this list over time. But, as the color\ncoding illustrates, many of the cities with the lowest median family income in 1959\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncontinue to be cities with the lowest median family income through the most recent\ndecade. For example, Lawrence has been among the six Massachusetts mid-sized cities\nwith the lowest median family income since 1959, and was in the unfortunate position of\nhaving the lowest median family income over the last three decades.\nFigure 3 shows how striking the decline in median family income has been in\nmany of these mid-sized cities relative to the median family income in the United States.\nThe city of Lawrence, which had been close to the median family income for the United\nStates in 1969, was earning only 60 percent of the median family income for the United\nStates by 2009. 6 In addition, most of the other mid-sized cities have seen median family\nincome relative to that for the United States fall by between 20 and 30 percent.\nWhile these cities have experienced difficulties for a variety of reasons, many of\nthem had strong manufacturing sectors in 1960, which provided median family incomes\nrelatively close to the national average. However, as Figure 4 illustrates, many of these\ncities have experienced dramatic declines in manufacturing employment, particularly\nover the past three decades.\nAs manufacturing declined in many of these mid-sized cities, one might have\nthought that the general population of such cities would drop significantly. Figure 5\nshows that while there have been modest percentage population declines in some cities,\nboth Chelsea and Lawrence have experienced increases in population. Of the five midsized cities with the lowest median family income, only Holyoke has seen a sizable\npercentage population decline.\nWhile the overall population of these cities generally has not experienced\ndramatic declines, there have been substantial changes in their demographic composition.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOne change has been the significant increase in Hispanic and Latino populations in many\nof these cities, as seen in Figure 6. These cities have often been referred to as “gateway”\ncities because many of them host sizable immigrant populations. During the decades\nwhen manufacturing was growing in New England, many of these immigrants came from\nEurope; more recently, many of the new immigrants have come from Latin America.\nThe one exception in the figure, Fall River, reflects that more than half the city’s\npopulation traces their ancestry back to the Azorean islands of Portugal. 7\nRegardless of their ethnic makeup, it is important to note that the failure of many\nof these cities to effectively deliver key “backbone” services can have a significant\nimpact on residents. For example, in Lawrence, the ability of residents to make progress\nwas impeded by the poor performance of the Lawrence Public Schools, culminating in\nthe schools being placed in state receivership.\nThese local problems are no small matter when you consider that most social and\neducational services are produced, managed, and provided locally. Local governments\nand local organizations play key roles in what is the focus of this conference – equalizing\neconomic opportunity. As you’ll see in Figure 7, in Lawrence alone, there are 14\nlicensed nonprofit center-based preschool programs, 11 nonprofit organizations providing\nsupport to young parents pursuing their education, and 10 nonprofit organizations that\nprovide ESOL classes. 8 It stands to reason that local services are likely to have the\ngreatest impact if they can be coordinated effectively and collaboratively – and if local\nprivate, public, and nonprofit resources are working together to address the multifaceted\nchallenges their residents may face.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nResearch by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana\nPatricia Muñoz found that having effective civic leadership and a common vision within\na city paired with strong cross-sector, collaborative support for that vision can\nsignificantly improve the chances of a city improving its economic circumstances. 9\nTheir research illustrates that a big part of the answer to these complicated and\npersistent challenges facing mid-size cities is people in multiple sectors working\ncollaboratively with a common vision. In addition, their research suggests that civic\ninfrastructure is a prerequisite to physical infrastructure, requiring active leadership of\ncross-sector “muscle,” spirited consensus, and passion and perseverance over the long\nhaul. Put another way, it may take 10 to 15 passionate but collaborative visionaries\npushing for some 10 to 15 years to achieve transformational change.\nFor the skeptics among us, allow me to acknowledge the obvious: economic\ndevelopment in these challenged cities will take time. The task and toil required are not\nunlike the paradox of the long distance runner. In order to reach the finish line\nsuccessfully, one needs equal amounts of patience and urgency. What our research\nsuggests is that like-minded local leaders collaboratively focused on an agreed-upon\nvision may be the key ingredient.\n\nReinventing Cities\nFigure 8 shows the mid-sized Massachusetts cities with the largest increase in\nmedian family income, measured relative to the United States as a whole. Three of the\nfour were relatively prosperous in 1959 and have seen improvements in median family\nincome relative to the United States since then. However, one of those cities, Cambridge,\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nstands out as a city that was below the U.S. median family income in 1979, but has done\nespecially well over the past three decades. In fact, Cambridge was among the 10 midsized cities with the lowest family income in Massachusetts in 1979, and has since made\nsignificant progress.\nClearly, Cambridge has benefited from large and important anchor educational\ninstitutions that have played a significant role in the city’s success. However, these\ninstitutions were in Cambridge well before 1979, yet only in the past 30 years have we\nseen significant improvements in median family income relative to the United States\nmedian. To be sure, many would cite gentrification as a complicated matter affecting the\nenhanced performance of some communities over time, Cambridge among them.\nWhile proximity to Boston and its strong educational, financial, and medical\ninstitutions has helped many Massachusetts cities to prosper, there are examples of midsized cities in New England that have reinvented themselves in other ways. Figure 9\nshows two other mid-sized cities in the region that have suffered major declines in\nmanufacturing, but, as shown in Figure 10, have experienced significantly improved\nfamily incomes relative to the United States median. Both Portland, Maine, and\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire – much like Cambridge, Massachusetts – had median\nfamily incomes well below that of the nation in 1979, but have shown significant\nimprovement since then. Again, gentrification’s mixed effects and role must be taken\ninto account, as it potentially increases the challenges for low- and moderate-income\nfamilies in communities that are making progress.\nNoting that some cities in New England and the nation have succeeded in\nreinventing themselves post-manufacturing, and given our research that highlighted the\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nneed to have strong cross-sector collaboration, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nconsidered how we could facilitate and support revival in some of our region’s mid-sized\ncities. The implementation of that vision has been the project we call the Working Cities\nChallenge. 10\n\nWhat Distinguishes “Working” Cities?\nThe Working Cities Challenge is an outgrowth of earlier community development\nwork at the Boston Fed. For example, we participated in a joint Brookings Institution\nand Federal Reserve study on concentrated poverty published in 2008. 11 As an\noutgrowth of that project, we began working with the city of Springfield, Massachusetts,\na populous “gateway” city that once had a strong manufacturing base, and studied the\ncivic dynamics in similar mid-sized cities that had experienced success in reinventing\nthemselves post-manufacturing. 12\nLooking to translate that research into action, we launched a competition among\n20 mid-sized Massachusetts cities that we identified as having a below-median family\nincome and above-median poverty rates. 13 The proposals those cities submitted needed\nto demonstrate strong collaboration between local businesses, nonprofits, and local\ngovernments. The cities vied for multi-year grants that would help to support the work\ndescribed in their proposal.\nInterestingly, in order to get the program up and running, we at the Boston Fed\nneeded to change our own behavior, step out of our comfort zone, and begin to\ncollaborate with cross-sector parties we had not worked with before. We tried to\n“practice what we preached” by actively adopting the very collaboration we were\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nadvocating for in the competition. Collaborating with outside parties turned out to be a\nmost illuminating experience, one we are still learning from as we consider broadening\nthe program to other states in New England.\nWe didn’t fund the grants ourselves – our private, public, and philanthropic\npartners did 14 – nor did we choose the winners. 15 What we did do was incent the\ndevelopment of the collaborative vision in each city by allowing only one proposal per\ncity and requiring high-level involvement from business, nonprofit, and local government\nleaders. Proposals could focus on any issue area, as long as they were meant to improve\nthe lives of low- and moderate-income citizens in their community.\nWhile we were looking for innovative proposals, this was as much about the\nprocess as the project. By that I refer to the ability of business leaders, government\nofficials, and nonprofit organizations in a particular city to focus on a specific problem\nfacing low- and moderate-income individuals in their city and work collaboratively to\nsolve it.\nHopefully, this process of working together will provide benefits well after the\nparticular project that the Working Cities Challenge funded is over. This is particularly\ntrue in relation to the private sector, which in some cases has not been at the table and\nactively engaged.\nAs a result of this relatively unconstrained application process, each of the 20\nWorking Cities put forward a proposal that addressed specific, systemic challenges facing\ntheir low- and moderate-income residents. In the western Massachusetts city of Holyoke,\nthe city team focused their proposal on ways to encourage Hispanic and Latino\nentrepreneurship. While nearly half of the city’s population identifies as Hispanic or\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nLatino, only 9 percent of Holyoke’s businesses are currently Latino-owned. By\nstreamlining access to the city’s economic development services, the Holyoke team’s\ninitiative aims to bring this figure to 25 percent over the next 10 years.\nA number of the proposals focused on helping cities make informed decisions\nusing data, a complicated and challenging area for smaller cities. In Fitchburg, the city is\nimplementing a “report card” for its North of Main neighborhood that tracks municipal\nindicators including education, public safety, economic development, and housing – to\nname a few. They hope to use the results to make better decisions about how the city\nallocates funding and resources for the neighborhood and its residents.\nEarlier in this talk I mentioned the city of Lawrence and the challenges its\nresidents faced due to poor performance in the school system. Lawrence actually won\nthe top prize in the Working Cities Challenge for a proposal that focused on its schools in\na unique way.\nTheir plan aims to strengthen the economic security of parents of children in the\nLawrence Public Schools by creating a network of workforce-supportive services ranging\nfrom specialized adult education and certificate training, employer internships, financial\ncoaching, and expanded access to child care – which is often crucial to helping a parent\nbe able to work more hours. Lawrence is also committed to making the school\ncommunity open and accessible to Latino residents – historically a challenge for many\ngateway cities. In implementing this comprehensive network of services, the Lawrence\nteam has a goal of raising the income of parents with children in the Lawrence Public\nSchool System by 15 percent over a 10-year period.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn Chelsea, the team is working to transform the city’s Shurtleff-Bellingham\nneighborhood from a transient, high-poverty area into a neighborhood where residents\nhave the opportunity to climb out of poverty, then choose to stay long-term and invest\ntime and resources.\nOn Thursday, Chair Yellen and I visited Chelsea to meet with the leaders and\nclients of CONNECT, a consortium of local organizations that works collaboratively to\nprovide integrated employment services for local residents related to economic\ninstability, housing, and financial and educational opportunities. 16 While there, we were\nable to hear from residents directly about how programs like CONNECT are making a\ndifference in their community, especially for those residents who are trying to enter or reenter the workforce. I found it very rewarding to be able to talk with Chelsea residents\nand see that the sort of collaboration encouraged by efforts like the Working Cities\nChallenge is indeed having a positive impact on their lives.\nWe are still in the first year of implementation, and realize that it will take some\ntime to see the full results. One positive outcome that we have seen so far is that the\nengaged participation of cities in the competition has encouraged other organizations to\nundertake similar endeavors. While the ultimate socioeconomic impact of this\ncompetition may take years to observe in the data, the initial qualitative results look\npromising. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will be looking to replicate the\nexperience in other states in New England, with the unique characteristics of each state\nimpacting the exact design of the competition.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that a variety of studies have\nhighlighted important interventions that can affect economic opportunity. Most of these\ninterventions – services and education, for example – are produced at the local level, so it\nstands to reason that the effective delivery of such services can be significantly impacted\nby the effectiveness with which communities and local institutions work together in\nproviding the services. Money alone is not sufficient. Many of the Massachusetts cities\nthat have lagged the nation have performed worse over time despite significant\nexpenditure of governmental or nonprofit funds in these cities.\nOur research at the Boston Fed suggests, in addition, that a crucial factor in these\noutcomes may be the inability of institutions and groups in these cities to mobilize\naround, support, and pull toward a collaborative vision for change.\nThis highlights that creating true economic opportunity may require new thinking\nand tactics, and new points of emphasis – such as civic collaboration and leadership –\nrather than just an increase in funds. The Boston Fed, sparked by its research that\nhighlighted the long-term benefits of cross-sector collaboration around a common vision,\nis looking to expand the Working Cities Challenge to try to incent communities to help\nthemselves.\nConcentrated, intergenerational poverty suggests that inequality of opportunity is\na community issue. Most agree that equality of opportunity is a crucial social goal.\nHopefully, research such as that done at this conference and policy experimentation of\nthe sort promoted by the Working Cities Challenge will make noticeable headway in\nattaining this vital goal. While we must not underestimate the challenges, hopefully we\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL October 18, 2014 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwill be able to look back a decade or so from now and see significant progress in our\ncommunities and steady improvements in equality of opportunity for people.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nNor are these issues just an annual event. For example, the Boston Fed’s interest in ensuring fair access\nto credit for all individuals was evident in research and analysis in the early 1990s culminating in the\nlandmark study of mortgage lending in 1992 that found that race was being used as a factor in mortgage\nlending decisions. Nor is it restricted to research, as the Boston Fed worked with banks and community\norganizations to try and make fair lending a reality. And more recently, the Boston Fed attempted to\nmitigate the effects of the recent mortgage market crisis by pursuing a variety of programs to help prevent\nunnecessary foreclosures – most notably three large foreclosure-prevention workshops.\n\n2\n\nNot surprisingly, the Boston Fed’s concern for the unemployed is evident when it comes to the\nformulation of national monetary policy. The Bank has a longstanding emphasis on the employment side\nof the Fed’s mandate that has characterized the policymaking and speeches of the Boston Fed presidents\nsince the 1970s – Frank Morris, Dick Syron, Cathy Minehan, and myself.\n\n3\n\nFor a good overview see Richard Reeve’s essay “Equality, Opportunity, and the American Dream.”\n\n4\n\nRon Haskins and Isabel Sawhill in their book, “Creating an Opportunity Society,” discuss a variety of\neconomic policies that could improve economic opportunity. Many of the policies would require effective\nprovision of local services.\n\n5\n\nWe define Massachusetts mid-sized cities as cities and towns with a population of 35,000 – 200,000 in\n2010 and a population of at least 30,000 in 1960. Thirty-three Massachusetts cities and towns meet these\ncriteria: Arlington, Beverly, Braintree, Brockton, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall\nRiver, Fitchburg, Framingham, Haverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Medford, New\nBedford, Newton, Peabody, Pittsfield, Quincy, Revere, Salem, Somerville, Springfield, Taunton, Waltham,\nWeymouth, Woburn, and Worcester.\n\n6\n\nFor this analysis, we used the 2008 – 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) data.\n\n7\n\nhttp://www.massinc.org/Programs/Gateway-Cities/About-the-Gateway-Cities.aspx\n\n8\n\nAnother consideration is the dissemination of state aid to local communities. Policy analysts in the\nBoston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center (NEPPC) explored this for Massachusetts and found that\nthe current local aid formula effectively gives favorable treatment to communities receiving more existing\naid compared with those receiving less or no existing aid. As a fairer alternative, the authors proposed a\nnew approach that considers existing and new aid together in filling the local gap.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Observations on Labor Markets”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNew Hampshire and Vermont Bankers Associations\nAnnual Conference\nBoston, Massachusetts\nSeptember 5, 2014\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today at the New Hampshire and Vermont\nBankers Associations Annual Conference.\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\nThe economy has been on the mend and the unemployment rate has declined\nalmost everywhere. You can certainly see this in Vermont, where the 3.7 percent\nunemployment rate is about where it was before the recession began. New Hampshire’s\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nunemployment rate is also well below the national unemployment rate, at 4.4 percent, but\nis still above where it was in 2006.\nDespite the improvement in labor markets over the past year, today’s employment\nreport was somewhat disappointing, with the increase in payroll employment of 142,000\njobs being below expectations, and the unemployment rate declining to 6.1 percent but in\npart because 64,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force. And while the number of\nAmericans working part time for economic reasons declined somewhat, there are still 7.3\nmillion Americans working part time for economic reasons.\nThe influence of labor market slack, broadly construed, on monetary policy\ndecisions is the main theme of this talk. My primary message is that significant slack\nremains, and thus monetary policy needs to be patient in removing stimulus.\nIn addition, given the uncertainties surrounding our forecasts of the pace of labormarket improvement and the degree of remaining slack, monetary policy has to be\ndetermined largely by incoming data and the signals that data provide about the health of\nlabor markets. If the economy disappoints we should be in no rush to raise short-term\nrates, but if the economy improves more quickly than anticipated we should raise shortterm rates earlier. Thus, we should be moving away from providing date-based forward\nguidance, and instead focus on what incoming data tell us about reaching full\nemployment and 2 percent inflation within a reasonable time period.\n\nMonetary Policy and Forward Guidance\nWhile the unemployment rates in New Hampshire and Vermont remain well\nbelow the national average, the significant declines in measures of national labor market\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nslack have raised questions of how and when central bank policymakers should normalize\nmonetary policy.\nIndeed, market participants and financial prognosticators have begun to fixate on\npotential calendar dates for when the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates.\nLet me say that I will not be providing any such guidance today. In fact, I actually hold\nthe view that as we approach levels of unemployment that many consider “full\nemployment,” the Fed should no longer issue guidance on the approximate timing of any\nmonetary policy changes.\nI do not intend this to reduce transparency in monetary policymaking. Rather, I\nsimply want to acknowledge that any reference to calendar dates has the potential to be\ninaccurate. The date of “liftoff” from near-zero short-term rates is highly dependent on\nhow the economy actually evolves – in other words, is going to be tied to the current and\nexpected path of inflation and employment. We are getting close enough to targets that,\ngiven the uncertainty around forecasts of these variables, incoming data that cause\nFederal Reserve policymakers to significantly change our outlook for the economy will\nshift any expected lift-off date forward or backward in time. So, again, reference to\ncalendar dates as we approach targets has the potential to be inaccurate.\nThis appropriate dependence on economic conditions takes on more weight when\none recognizes that many of the variables we focus on have behaved differently than\nexpected over the past two years. For example, real GDP over the past two years has\nbeen weaker than most forecasters expected, unemployment has fallen faster than\nexpected (particularly given the disappointment in real GDP), and many forecasters\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nexpected the inflation rate to reach the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent1 more\nquickly.\nNotably, while some analysts are quite willing to predict precise dates for lifting\nshort-term rates, surveys of such lift-off dates actually provide a very wide range of\npossibilities. This, of course, is consistent with the uncertainty associated with predicting\neconomic outcomes. Indeed, Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the primary dealers’\nexpectations for when the first rate increase will occur. While the consensus is centered\non the middle of next year, there are significant probabilities attached to the first rate hike\nbeing earlier or later than the middle of next year. This wide distribution of predictions\npresumably reflects both uncertainty about the forecast for the economy, and different\nviews about how monetary policy will respond to actual conditions.\nCritical to any decision on lifting short-term rates will be the matter of how much\nlabor market slack exists currently, and how long before the economy reaches what we\nwould consider to be full employment. While my remarks will be focused on labor\nmarkets, it is important to remember that labor market slack (which dampens wagegrowth pressure) is one reason that inflation has remained persistently below the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent inflation target since the financial crisis. As labor markets tighten,\nwe would expect the inflation rate to approach the 2 percent inflation target more rapidly,\nas well.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nFigure 2 provides private-sector forecasts for the path of the unemployment rate,\nfrom two groups of economic forecasters – the Blue Chip economic forecast and the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters. The forecasts are quite consistent with each other\n(due in part to some overlap between survey participants), with both predicting a gradual\nreduction of the unemployment rate from the 6.1 percent level we currently see nationally\nas reported in the August employment report. For the Blue Chip forecast, which extends\nthrough 2015, the forecasters on average expect that the unemployment rate will be 5.5\npercent at the end of next year.\nThe horizontal line at 5.25 percent indicates the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston’s estimate of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment. I would\nnote that the Boston Fed’s estimate is at the low end of forecasts for FOMC participants,\nwhere the central tendency for the unemployment rate in the long run is from 5.2 to 5.5\npercent, as shown in the June Summary of Economic Projections.2\nUnfortunately, the forecasts shown in Figure 2 only go through the end of next\nyear. If one assumes that the unemployment rate will continue to fall at the same pace in\n2016 as it is expected to fall in 2015, both forecasts would reach the Boston Fed’s 5.25\npercent estimate of full employment around the middle of 2016. As I’ve said on many\noccasions, I personally do not expect that it will be appropriate to raise short-term rates\nuntil the U.S. economy is within one year of both achieving full employment and\nreturning to within a narrow band around 2 percent inflation. Again, that is my personal\nview. And, if one were to also assume that tightening would begin roughly one year\nbefore reaching full employment and the 2 percent inflation target, then one could say\nthat the primary dealers’ estimates of a rate rise bunched around mid-2015 seem roughly\nconsistent with the forecasts for unemployment in Figure 2.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, I would reiterate that there is significant uncertainty surrounding these\nforecasts. We see this more clearly in Figure 3, which shows not only the average of all\nthe forecasts in the Blue Chip survey, but also the average of the 10 lowest and 10 highest\nforecasts for unemployment among the more than 50 forecasters in the survey. The\naverage of the 10 lowest forecasts for the unemployment rate dips below 5.25 percent by\nthe end of 2015, while the average of the 10 highest forecasts declines only to 5.8 percent\nat the end of 2015, still well above the 5.25 percent line.\nAnother measure of the uncertainty surrounding these private-sector forecasts is\nrepresented in Figure 4, which shows the unemployment path that was being forecast by\nthe Blue Chip survey in March 2013 (when the 2014 quarterly forecast first became\navailable). At that time, the average forecast of unemployment for the second quarter of\n2014 was 7.3 percent. The consensus (average) forecast was more than a percentage\npoint too high. Even the 6.9 percent average of the lowest 10 forecasts was still well\nabove the realized rate of 6.2 percent for the second quarter of 2014 and 6.1 percent for\nAugust 2014, just released today. Clearly, most forecasters expected a much more\ngradual improvement in the unemployment rate than actually occurred.\nGiven that economic forecasters have expected a much slower decline in the\nunemployment rate, we should ask ourselves if these errors of overestimating\nunemployment rates are likely to persist. The answer, in my view, is not necessarily.\nI say this because one reason for the large error in estimating the decline in the\nunemployment rate has been the unexpectedly slow growth of the labor force. Everyone\nknew that the aging of the Baby Boom generation would slow down this growth rate.\nBut it appears that some people who were expected to stay in the labor force became\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndiscouraged with their potential job prospects and withdrew, while others never joined at\nall. However, as labor markets tighten, the job prospects for these discouraged workers\nshould improve. It is likely that some of the new jobs opening up will be filled by\nindividuals not currently counted in the labor force.3\nIndeed, in terms of monthly gross flows, the number of people moving from out\nof the labor force into employment is considerably larger than the number moving from\nbeing unemployed (but in the labor force) to employed. In this way, as labor markets\ntighten, the unemployment rate may decline more slowly than its recent trend – even with\ngrowth in payroll employment continuing at the levels seen in the first half of this year.\nThis also highlights why the traditional unemployment rate may not, by itself,\ngive a full picture of labor market conditions.\n\nAlternative Measures of Labor Market Slack\nFigure 5 provides some alternative measures of labor market slack in addition to\nthe traditional, widely reported “U-3” civilian unemployment rate.4 The U-4 measure\nincludes the unemployed workers counted in the U-3 plus so-called “discouraged\nworkers.”5 Discouraged workers have looked for work in the past year and are available\nto work, but have stopped looking because they believe there are no jobs available for\ntheir skill sets.\nThe U-5 measure adds so-called “other marginally attached” workers to the\namount of unemployed and discouraged workers.6 Like discouraged workers, these\nadditional marginally attached workers have also said they want a job, are available for\nwork, and have looked for work in the past year – but they are no longer looking, largely\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbecause they believe there are no jobs available for the schedules or in the locations they\ncan work.\nAnd the broadest measure, U-6, includes unemployed workers, discouraged\nworkers, other workers marginally attached to the workforce, and workers who are parttime for economic reasons. 7 The latter means that they are working, and are available to\nwork full time, but they are working part-time because their hours have been cut back or\nthey have been unable to find a full-time job.\nLooking at the shaded recession periods, you see that the more widely-cited U-3\nmeasure of unemployment, as well as the broader measures of labor market conditions,\nrose much more during the last recession than in the previous one – and still remain well\nabove pre-recession levels.\nOf course, whether this elevated unemployment rate reflects the business cycle or\na more lasting structural shift is a matter of debate among economists and others. While\nmy analysis generally suggests that a sizable fraction of the increase in unemployment\nshould be attributed to cyclical causes, I acknowledge it is possible that the broader\nmeasures also reflect increasing structural problems in the labor market – and also,\nimportantly, that problems that were initially cyclical may have become more structural\nin nature during a painfully slow recovery. The implications would be more people\npermanently withdrawing from the labor force or working part-time when they would\nprefer full-time work.\nAllow me to now show you some analysis that I consider illuminating as I study\nconditions in the labor market.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 6 shows how states look when plotted in terms of the U-3 rate (the\nhorizontal position) and workers part-time for economic reasons (the vertical position),\nboth compared to a pre-recession average (calculated from 2005 to 2007). A large\nnumber of states are clustered in the upper right hand quadrant of the figure, indicating\nthat both U-3 unemployment and those who are part-time for economic reasons remain\nwell above levels from before the recession. There is also a clear trend in the data, where\nstates with U-3 unemployment well above that pre-recession average tend to have higher\npart-time workers relative to pre-recession levels. I would also point out that many of the\nstates that have very high U-3 unemployment and workers part-time for economic\nreasons are states that were disproportionately impacted by the financial crisis (states\nsuch as Arizona, Nevada, and Florida).\nWe should note that the line you see fit to the data points does not go through the\nzero origin on the vertical scale, giving some quantitative evidence to suggest that even if\na state returned to its pre-recession level of unemployment, one would still see somewhat\nhigher percentages of workers who are part-time for economic reasons.\nAlmost half the U.S. states are close to or below their pre-recession U-3 average –\nthat is, within a percentage point of, or below, the y-axis. However, there is less\nbunching near or below zero for those part-time for economic reasons – that is, close to\nor below the zero horizontal axis on the chart. In fact, only three states are now below\ntheir pre-recession level for those part-time for economic reasons – North Dakota,\nAlaska, and Arkansas.\nThe table in Figure 7 summarizes the data in the previous figure. There are eight\nstates that now have U-3 unemployment below the average prior to the recession,\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncompared to the three states with workers part-time for economic reasons below prerecession levels. If one looks at the number of states below or within one percentage\npoint of the pre-recession average, there are 22 states when using the U-3 measure, but\nonly 13 states when using part-time for economic reasons.\nMy next two figures show how the share of people working part time for\neconomic reasons has changed since 2006 – before the crisis – for different age groups.\nFigure 8 presents the younger age groups – 20 to 24, and 25 to 34. In the 20 to 24 age\ngroup, the share of workers part-time for economic reasons rose dramatically relative to\n2006 levels. While there has been some decline relative to 2006, workers part-time for\neconomic reasons in this age group remain a much higher share than pre-recession levels.\nThe right side of the figure shows that this is also true, but much less dramatically so, for\nthe 25 to 34 age group.\nFigure 9 shows that for older age groups (35 to 44, and 45 to 54), the part-time\nfor economic reasons experience compared to pre-crisis 2006 is also much less elevated.\nWhile the share of part-time for economic reasons is still higher than the 2006 average, it\nis much less dramatic than for the younger cohorts.\nFigure 10 shows the actual percentages of workers part-time for economic\nreasons in 2006 and in 2014, by age cohort. For the two youngest age groups, the percent\npart-time for economic reasons remains quite elevated relative to 2006 and relative to\nother age cohorts. One might have thought that many in those younger age cohorts are\nrecently educated and mobile, so that as we experience tighter labor markets it might\nbecome much less common for them to work part time for economic reasons. However,\nit is certainly possible that there has been a structural change in labor markets that makes\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nit more difficult for those in younger age groups to get full-time employment. While I\nexpect that much of this pattern is a function of cyclical slack in the labor markets, the\ntrends in those working part-time for economic reasons in younger age groups is an\nimportant dynamic worthy of further study.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that significant excess capacity remains\nin labor markets. Today’s somewhat disappointing employment report, with only gradual\nimprovement through creation of 142,000 jobs in July, highlights that the time it will take\nto return to full employment remains highly uncertain. However, a return to full\nemployment could occur within a two-year horizon, if the economy continues to\ngradually improve. Of course, the degree of uncertainty surrounding such forecasts\nreadily admits the possibility of a return to full employment several quarters earlier or\nlater.\nOne issue that has been raised by some observers is a view that labor markets\nhave tightened sufficiently to make inflation more of a near-term concern. However,\nFigure 11 shows that total compensation, and wages and salaries, have all been growing\nquite slowly. The current growth rate in compensation remains below most estimates of\nthe standard benchmark of real labor productivity growth plus 2 percent inflation.\nIn sum, while we have approached full employment more rapidly than many\nexpected, substantial labor market slack remains. In addition, PCE inflation remains at\nonly 1.6 percent, with no sign of significant wage pressures in labor markets. The lack of\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL September 5, 2014 at 3:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwage pressures suggests that we are not yet near full employment, and that there is no\nupward pressure on inflation coming from wages.\nAs a consequence of all this, and given the evidence that the broader measures of\nunemployment are being driven by cyclical realities, it seems to me appropriate for\nmonetary policy to continue to be patient – in the interest of ensuring that the economy\nreaches full employment and the 2 percent inflation target as quickly as possible.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nUsing the PCE or Personal Consumption Expenditures price index.\n\n2\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20140618.pdf.\n\n3\n\nI recommend “Labor Market Exit and Re-Entry: Is the United States Poised for a Rebound in\nthe Labor Force Participation Rate? by Daniel Cooper and María José Luengo-Prado\n(http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/current-policy-perspectives/2014/cpp1402.htm).\n4\n\nI discussed this topic at length earlier this year:\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2014/020614/index.htm.\n\n5\n\nAs a percent of the labor force plus discouraged workers.\n\n6\n\nAs a percentage of the labor force plus workers that are marginally attached to the labor force.\n\n7\n\nAs a percentage of the labor force plus workers that are marginally attached to the labor force.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Central Bank of Guatemala\nXXIII Cycle of Economic Lectures\nGuatemala City, Guatemala\nMonday, June 9, 2014\n\nI would like to thank the Central Bank of Guatemala and President Barquín Durán for this\nopportunity to discuss U.S. monetary policy. I appreciate the opportunity to take part in your Cycle of\nEconomic Lectures, and to be here with so many practitioners from the region.\nToday, I would like to suggest some context for the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and\nlarge-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), discuss some of the impacts of those policies, and provide my\nown view of how these tools might evolve if the U.S. economy continues to slowly recover and the\nhigh degree of monetary accommodation can be gradually removed.\nAs always, I would note that my comments reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nWhile forward guidance and LSAPs have been actively used in the United States in recent\nyears, I would suggest that a full assessment of the costs and benefits of these programs is still\nsomewhat premature at this time – since the Federal Reserve has really only recently begun a process\nthat will ultimately remove the high degree of monetary accommodation that is currently in place. At\npresent, our asset purchases continue to add to accommodation, albeit in smaller and smaller\nincrements reflecting recent policy decisions.\nAllow me to briefly preview my conclusions today.\nMy own view is that the “new” monetary tools – LSAPs and forward guidance – were\nessential. Particularly important, I believe, was the Federal Reserve’s stated emphasis on doing what\nit would take to generate an economic recovery, and on following through with actions that\ndemonstrated we were indeed willing to do what it took.\nMany of these policies were introduced at a time when the U.S. economy was in the throes of\na significant recession – with the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound – and clearly required\nmore accommodation from new monetary tools. As you can see in Figure 1, the Federal Reserve\nfollowed the first round in late 20081 with additional rounds of stimulus in 20102, 20113, and 20124\n(still underway) as the economy continued to underperform relative to expectations and historical\nnorms for recoveries.\nThe LSAPs, Maturity Extension Program, and forward guidance policy tools lowered key\ninterest rates and, importantly, also played a role in rebounding asset prices, such as U.S. housing\nvalues and stock prices. Certainly we saw more spending in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.\nIn sum, our new tools were partly responsible for improved economic conditions and improved labor\nmarkets – trends that have proven effective enough that the Federal Reserve could begin gradually\nstepping back the degree of accommodation.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nIn terms of the international view, I would say that while the U.S. has benefitted from these\npolicies, they were introduced at a time when many other economies were also lagging – including\nJapan, Europe, and many emerging economies. The increased willingness of U.S. households to\nconsume, and U.S. firms to invest, has helped generate a more robust export market to the U.S. –\ncertainly a more favorable market than would have prevailed if policies had not changed and the U.S.\neconomy had remained as subdued in outcomes as most forecasters expected at that time.\nWhile our policies, in my view, have been instrumental in achieving better economic\noutcomes, they are not without challenges. Allow me to mention a few of these.\nFirst, because financial market participants factor in the expectation of future policy rates, the\nFed’s exit strategy is of great interest to them. Uncertainty or misunderstanding about the contours of\nour exit has the potential to be problematic in both advanced and developing economies – as we were\nreminded a year ago – so effective and transparent communication has become even more important\nthan in the past. This is not a traditional area of expertise for most central banks, but we are making\nstrides and improving.\nAs we learn how to better communicate our intentions about these new and less-tested tools,\nmarkets too have to learn and adjust – given that our communication about these new tools, along\nwith the effects on the economy, are new to markets. The period of adjustment on both sides has led\nto a few challenges, but appears to have evened out in recent months.\nBut we should all acknowledge the possibility that this relative calm may be challenged in the\nfuture. The eventual exit from very low interest rates around much of the globe will also be\nunprecedented, and will thus hold challenges for communication and understanding. Having said\nthat, I would observe that the careful consideration of all of the aspects of the exit strategy provides\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nopportunities to consider a broader set of monetary policy tools, and how those tools impact financial\nstability along with inflation and unemployment.\n\nEconomic Conditions Leading to “QE3”\nIt is important to remember the economic context around the selection of policy tools in the\nfall of 2012 – popularly referred to as “QE3,” shorthand for a third round of quantitative easing.\nFigure 2 shows private sector forecasts for U.S. real GDP growth in August of 2012. The U.S.\neconomy grew just 1.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012,5 and the consensus expectation was that\nthe next several quarters were not likely to be significantly better. The different paths projected by\naveraging the 10 highest and the 10 lowest forecasts show that the outlook was clouded by a high\ndegree of uncertainty. But again, both the consensus forecast and the pessimistic forecast were quite\nweak over the near term.\nFigure 3 shows that private forecasters expected declines in the U.S. unemployment rate, but\nonly gradual declines consistent with slow progress toward full employment. Notice the large gap\nbetween even the optimistic forecast and my own estimate of full employment in the United States,\n5.25 percent, shown by the line near the bottom of the chart. With forecasters expecting\nunemployment to be above 7 percent at the end of 2013, it was clear that we were far from attaining\nnormal conditions in labor markets (even if one’s estimate of the full employment level of\nunemployment was somewhat higher than my own 5.25 percent).\nSo in the fall of 2012, the case for additional monetary stimulus was straightforward to me.\nUnemployment was quite high, and it was likely that inflation would undershoot the Federal\nReserve’s inflation target. We were falling short on both parts of the Federal Reserve’s “dual\nmandate,”6 so qualitatively speaking, the appropriate stance for monetary policy was clear.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nAs a result, in September of 2012,7 the monetary policymaking Federal Open Market\nCommittee, intending to increase policy accommodation, undertook an additional program of monthly\npurchases of long-term mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In contrast to our previous asset purchase\nprograms, the Committee did not specify how long the purchases would continue or how much it\nwould buy in total. This was a manifestation of being willing to do “whatever it takes.” In addition,\nthe Committee statement emphasized that purchases would continue if the outlook for the labor\nmarket did not improve substantially. The Maturity Extension Program – through which the Federal\nReserve was extending the average maturity of its U.S. Treasury securities holdings8 – continued.\nThese actions, declared the Committee’s policy statement, “will increase the Committee’s holdings of\nlonger-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year.”\nIn December of 2012,9 it was announced that the open-ended purchase program would include\npurchases of longer-term U.S. Treasury securities (once the Maturity Extension Program concluded at\nyear end), and the Committee attempted to clarify that conditions in the labor market would determine\nthe length of the asset purchase program in their statement – saying that “this exceptionally low range\nfor the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above\n6.5 percent” and inflation and inflation expectations remain anchored. All in all, the open-ended\npurchase program, along with strong forward guidance, made it clear that U.S. monetary\npolicymakers were determined to achieve significant improvements in labor market conditions.\nA major source of the U.S. economy’s weakness at that time had been the failure of the\nhousing market to rebound. In part, this was tied to concerns that housing prices in many areas would\ncontinue to fall, damping the impetus to buy. Figure 4 shows a standard forecast for U.S. housing\nprices in August 2012. The figure shows that actual housing prices fared much better than the\nforecast made prior to our monetary policy decision.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nGiven that the cost of purchasing a home is tied to long-term interest rates, the Federal\nReserve’s accommodative monetary policy facilitated some of the recovery in housing values.\nIndeed, Figure 5 shows that low interest rates and higher housing prices provided the driving force\nfor a greater number of housing starts than had been forecast.\nOther interest-sensitive sectors, such as automobile purchases, were also helped by the lower\ninterest rates generated by the Federal Reserve’s policy stance and actions. Figure 6 shows that U.S.\nauto sales ended up much stronger than forecasters had expected in August of 2012.\nFigure 7 shows that U.S. unemployment actually fell more quickly than expected by\nforecasters in August of 2012. In my view, the unconventional use of forward guidance and LSAPs\ndid contribute to a faster improvement in labor markets than forecasters were expecting.10 However,\nthe exact mechanism for this faster recovery is still a source of some debate; since labor markets\nshowed improvement fairly quickly, but the growth in aggregate spending during this period remained\nfrustratingly slow by historical standards. Still, my own view is that the open-ended nature of the\nFederal Reserve’s purchase program and the strong forward guidance together encouraged private\nsector investors to purchase a wide array of long-term assets, lowering long-term interest rates and\nhelping many asset prices rebound – and thus amplifying the impact of the Federal Reserve’s actions.\nTo the extent that this generated a stronger economy and rebounding prices, it was at that\npoint a great benefit. However, the success in driving down long rates bore with it a future downside\nrisk, as well. Those investors who were buying assets under the assumption that their prices would\nrebound and their yields fall as the Federal Reserve pursued its expansionary policy were likely to be\nquite sensitive to the reversal of these policies. Of course, the point at which that reversal would\nhappen was quite uncertain, so that knowing when and how to protect against that risk was likely\nsomewhat difficult.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nIndeed, Figure 8 shows the movement of 10-year U.S. Treasury security yields over the\ncourse of 2013. Once the U.S. economy began to improve and the Federal Reserve began to discuss a\ngradual reduction in purchases, many market participants who had been invested “alongside” the\nFederal Reserve became active sellers.\nThis was particularly true for highly leveraged investors who had borrowed “short” and\ninvested “long” by engaging in the so-called “carry trade” – an issue of particular relevance in\nemerging markets where interest rates were considerably higher than in the United States. The result\nwas a fairly significant increase in long-term rates and a repatriation of funds that had been previously\nborrowed short and invested long in emerging-market securities.\nThe unwinding of the carry trade was a particularly thorny issue for countries with high dollardenominated yields and fixed exchange rates, and for countries that had high yields and a policy of\ngradual currency appreciation relative to the dollar. The speed and magnitude of the readjustment\nhighlighted just how low long-term rates had been pushed. It also suggested that many models of the\nimpact of Federal Reserve asset purchase programs had not fully accounted for potential investor\nreaction to the policy, or the impact of a sudden reassessment of investor desire to engage in the carry\ntrade.\nDespite the rather abrupt change in market interest rates last spring, the U.S. economy has\ncontinued to improve, as have the economies in many other countries. To be sure, the increase in\nmarket rates had some noticeable effects: some of the recent slowdown in housing activity is likely\nattributable to the rise in mortgage rates in the wake of last year’s market adjustment.\nIn sum, this episode made clear the importance of Federal Reserve communication and market\nunderstanding about programs and policies. The episode also underlined the importance of\ncalibrating investor reactions into models of policy impact.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nWith the onset of the gradual tapering that was announced in December of last year, the\nFederal Reserve’s asset purchase program has been reduced from $85 billion a month to now $45\nbillion a month – still providing policy accommodation, but at a lessening rate. Figure 9 shows that\nthe volatility of U.S. Treasury securities has recently been quite low. I would attribute that in part to\nthe very gradual and predictable reduction in the purchase program, along with an economy that has\ncontinued to improve, albeit only gradually and with some setbacks along the way.\nImportantly, I suspect that the benign reaction to the gradual tapering of stimulus over the last\n6 months may be instructive as we consider how best to wind down the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet once the tapering of asset purchases is complete. While the optimal program for reducing the\nFed’s balance sheet will need to be dependent on the state of the economy, the recent tapering\nexperience suggests to me that a predictable, transparent reduction in the balance sheet could be done\nin ways that may minimize the risk of financial disruption.\nLet me offer one scenario that I have been considering, in light of the sorts of financial\nstability concerns that I and my colleagues keep in mind. In one scenario, a reduction in the balance\nsheet, when that becomes appropriate, could be implemented as a basically seamless continuation of\nthe tapering program used for reductions in the purchase program. For example, the Committee could\ndecide to reinvest all but a given percentage of securities on the balance sheet as they reach maturity,\nand increase that percentage at each subsequent meeting, assuming conditions allow.\nSuch a tapering of the reinvestment program could allow for a gradual and transparent\nreduction in the Fed’s balance sheet. As the economy moved closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2\npercent inflation target and full employment, there could be a gradual reduction in the reinvestment\npolicy – which would allow for a predictable reduction in the size of the balance sheet. However, the\npace of reinvestment should always be considered in the context of the economic outcomes we are\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nseeking to achieve. If the economy was substantially stronger or substantially weaker than was\nexpected, the reinvestment program would need adjustment. Again, I mention this as simply one\nscenario for consideration.\n\nFinancial Stability and Federal Reserve Exit Strategy\nIn the wake of a financial crisis with serious global ramifications, financial stability and early\nidentification of troubling economic trends have received increased attention at central banks around\nthe world. As the Federal Reserve considers its exit strategy from a very accommodative policy\nstance, significant attention is being given, as it should, to potential financial stability matters.\nI personally do not expect that it will be appropriate to raise short-term rates until the U.S.\neconomy is within one year of both achieving full employment and returning to within a narrow band\naround 2 percent inflation. Again, that is my personal view. However, both the transition to higher\nrates and the operating procedure for doing so could entail financial stability effects that should be\nthoughtfully considered – and I am certain will be.\nAs Figure 10 illustrates, the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policies over the past\nseveral years have resulted in a significant increase in what we call “excess reserves” – bank reserves\nthat exceed regulatory reserve requirements. As long as a large quantity of excess reserves exist in\nthe financial system, the standard tools for raising the federal funds rate are not available to the Fed –\nthat is, affecting the supply of reserves and thus the cost of borrowing them, translating into interest\nrates. Fortunately, there are a variety of other tools the Federal Reserve can use.\nOne possible strategy, when it is appropriate to start raising rates, is to raise the rate of interest\nthat the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves. Banks will be unwilling to hold other assets that do\nnot pay at least the rate of interest on excess reserves, so this should raise short-term market interest\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nrates even in the presence of substantial excess reserves. However, since only depository institutions\nhold reserves, the effect of this rate on other market rates may be somewhat muted, leading some\nshort-term interest rates in the marketplace to trade below the interest rate on excess reserves.\nIf the Federal Reserve wants to have more control of short-term rates, it could engage in\novernight reverse repurchase agreements, which are in effect collateralized loans to the Federal\nReserve that would provide a risk-free rate of return to investors. Investors would essentially buy\ngovernment securities from the Federal Reserve and agree to sell back those securities a day later at a\npre-determined interest rate. Similar to setting the rate paid on excess reserves, the Federal Reserve\ncould in effect place a floor on how low short-term rates would fall in the marketplace, by setting the\nreverse repo rate – since investors would have access to the low-risk reverse repo rates and thus be\nunwilling to accept lower rates of return in the markets. Because reverse repo transactions can\ninvolve a broader set of counterparties than just the banking system, this tool might have a more\nreliable effect on short-term market interest rates.\nLet me be quick to add that one negative, collateral impact of engaging in reverse repos is that\nduring a period of heightened financial risk, investors might flee to the reverse repo market. This\nwould provide a safe asset for investors, but might also encourage runs from higher-risk, short-term\nprivate debt instruments. This would have the potential to create significant private sector financing\ndisruptions during times of stress. Presumably, capping the size of the reverse repo facility could help\nlimit the impact.\nOn the other hand, a positive collateral impact of using reverse repos and interest on excess\nreserves in these ways is that the ability to control short-term rates would not be tied to actions that\nimpact the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. This means the Federal Reserve could have\nadditional financial stability tools at its disposal, if it chose to maintain a larger-than-traditional\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nbalance sheet with a greater mix of assets. Naturally, maintaining a large balance sheet comprising\nboth U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities would provide the Federal Reserve with\ncontinuing options for impacting long-term interest rates and the spread between mortgage-backed\nsecurities and U.S. Treasury securities. For example, if a bubble seemed to be developing in housing\nmarkets generally, the Federal Reserve would have the option of addressing it by selling MBS or\nlong-duration U.S. Treasury securities. This again is a notion that I consider worthy of further\nexploration and debate.\nClearly, there will be financial stability implications stemming from the set of transitional and\nlonger-term tools that the FOMC eventually chooses. While the Federal Reserve has the ability to\ncontrol short-term rates, different tools may have different implications for financial stability. As the\nFederal Reserve continues to experiment with different ways to alter short-term interest rates, I\nbelieve we should focus intently on, and develop a better understanding of, these potential financial\nstability issues.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would note that regardless of the tools eventually chosen, history shows that\nmonetary policy “exits” can be unsettled. Obviously the interaction of marketplace and central bank\nexpectations can be quite intricate.\nAn example is shown in Figure 11. The dotted ovals reflect the last two times that monetary\npolicy significantly reversed direction as the U.S. economy recovered from a recession. In 1994, the\nFOMC began to raise short-term rates, but long-term rates reacted significantly to the tightening. The\n10-year rate rose substantially, and in fact rose much higher than the level it would settle at over\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nsubsequent years. In contrast, the tightening in 2004 caused little reaction in long-term rates, despite\nthe significant increases that were occurring in short-term rates.\nSo we see that even in a less complicated operating environment (like 1994), large discrete\nmovements are quite possible. While some volatility may actually help reduce the risk that investors\ndevelop ultimately destabilizing carry-trade type strategies, too much volatility can obviously be\ncounterproductive. Of course it is important to avoid binding specificity about future actions, since\npolicies should be responsive to actual conditions as clarity emerges about the strength of the\neconomy and the impact of various tightening tools.\nAs I conclude my remarks today, let me again show you Figure 1, which summarizes the\ngrowth in Federal Reserve assets given our policy actions since the financial crisis and recession. In\nsum, as I mentioned at the outset, my view is that these new monetary tools – the LSAPs, Maturity\nExtension Program, and forward guidance – were essential in recent years. However, while these\npolicies have been instrumental in achieving better economic outcomes, clearly they are not without\nchallenges. Despite the challenges, we need to seize this opportunity to carefully consider a broader\nset of monetary policy tools and how those tools impact financial stability in addition to inflation and\nunemployment.\nThe forum you are holding is a good example of that process of consideration, study, and\ndebate, and again I thank you for inviting me to take part.\nThank you.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nMonday, June 9, 2014 at 1:30pm U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. local time in Guatemala City, or upon delivery\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Press Release: “Federal Reserve announces it will initiate a program to purchase the direct\nobligations of housing-related government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae”, November 25, 2008.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm\n\n2\n\nSee the November 3, 2010 FOMC Statement: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20101103a.htm\n\n3\n\nThe Maturity Extension Program began.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nHusson University\nBangor, Maine\nApril 15, 2014\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is always a pleasure to return to the state of Maine, where I spent four wonderful years\nas an undergraduate at Colby College, and where I first developed my interest in economics.\nAround New England today, April 15, we are marking one year since the tragic Boston\nMarathon bombings. For all those who were affected, our thoughts are very much with you.\nTurning to my topic today, let me say that when driving up I-95 and crossing the bridge\nover the Piscataqua River I always like seeing the sign that says, “Maine, the way life should\nbe.” Unfortunately, it has been some time since anyone would characterize the U.S. economy’s\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nperformance as “the way life should be.” By this I mean that it has been more than six years\nsince the beginning of the last recession, and yet we still have a national unemployment rate of\n6.7 percent, and the PCE inflation rate is less than 1 percent1 – well below the 2 percent inflation\ntarget set by the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee or\nFOMC.\nOf course I would add that, as always, the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the FOMC.\nActually, the widely reported unemployment rate understates the severity of the problem.\nThe broader labor-market indicators that include workers who are “part time for economic\nreasons” and workers who have looked for a job in the past year but not in the past four weeks –\n“marginally attached” workers – remain unusually elevated by historical standards. These\nindicators quantify what many Americans all too readily observe around them – that significant\nproblems in labor markets persist even at this stage of the recovery.\nAll this means we have a U.S. economy that still requires an unusually accommodative\nstance of monetary policy. At the same time, the economy has indeed been gradually improving.\nThe most recent labor market report indicated that the U.S. economy produced 192,000 jobs in\nMarch, and there were some positive revisions for the data in previous months. So, after some\nweaker data in the winter months, these labor market data suggest that there will hopefully be\nbroader improvement in an array of economic indicators this spring. In fact, most economists\nexpect growth around 3 percent over the rest of this year – a forecast that is quite consistent with\nmy own.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs the economy has gradually improved, the Federal Reserve has made adjustments to\nmonetary policy. In light of the weak economy, and with the federal funds rate essentially\npinned at zero, the Federal Reserve has been stimulating the economy using alternative methods,\nprimarily by making large-scale purchases of longer-term assets such as Treasury bonds and\nmortgage-backed securities. These purchases are expected to keep longer-term interest rates\nlower than they would otherwise be, thus stimulating the economy when we can no longer do so\nby lowering the funds rate. Since the beginning of this year, we have been reducing the size of\nthe monthly asset purchase program, and this gradual tapering is likely to continue as long as the\neconomy’s gradual improvement proceeds.\nThe second adjustment to monetary policy involves how the FOMC communicates future\npolicy direction, commonly referred to as “forward guidance.” When the economy was far from\nwhere it needed to be, the FOMC provided fairly specific guidance – that short-term rates would\nremain low until we had seen significant improvement in labor markets – improvement that\ncould be proxied by seeing the unemployment rate fall to the 6.5 percent threshold.\nHowever, such a threshold does not provide much by way of forward guidance as we\napproach it. With a gradually improving labor market, we could be below the threshold\nrelatively soon. This scenario led the Federal Reserve to make an adjustment to its\ncommunications at the March FOMC meeting, suggesting they would hold short-term rates at\nvery low levels “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and\nprovided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”2\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAdmittedly, this rather qualitative forward guidance is somewhat less specific than the\nprevious forward guidance involving the 6.5 percent threshold. My personal view is that,\nideally, forward guidance should, for the time being, remain qualitative but increasingly be\nlinked to progress in achieving our dual mandate based on incoming economic data. In\nparticular, I believe the FOMC’s forward guidance should be consistent with keeping interest\nrates at their very low level until we are within one year of reaching full employment and our 2\npercent inflation target – and the guidance could explicitly state that intention.\nParenthetically, I would note that on a quarterly basis the Federal Reserve publishes a\nsummary of the economic projections (SEP) made by Federal Reserve Board members and\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents. The SEP does give information on the expectations of the\nCommittee regarding when the economy would be reaching the dual mandate goals.3\nToday I plan to discuss why, as we gradually do approach achieving our dual mandate\ngoals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, the Fed’s forward guidance\nshould be increasingly focused on how quickly we expect to make progress on inflation that is\nwell below our target, and on the significant underutilization of labor resources that persists well\nafter the official end of the recession.\nI would like to see a more productive state of affairs, where market participants are more\nattentive to the incoming data and how the data fit (or do not fit) with the expectations in the\nforward guidance. In this way, market participants would be focused more on data and less on\nchanges in the setting of monetary policy tools. I would also like to see much more focus by\nmarket participants on a broader set of measures, such as the U-6 measure of unemployment\nwhich captures broader utilization of labor resources.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRecent Developments\nLet me begin by walking you through some charts that reflect the economy’s recent\ndevelopments.\nFigure 1 provides the path of the unemployment rate relative to the Federal Reserve’s\nearlier stated threshold of 6.5 percent. The figure provides visual support for the fact that the\nforward guidance needed to change. Once we reached a point where we could be below the\nthreshold with one or two favorable employment reports, the guidance was no longer providing\nmuch information about our potential actions beyond one or two FOMC meetings. Keep in mind\nthat one purpose of forward guidance is to restrain longer-term market interest rates to support\nthe struggling economy by promising to keep the short-term interest rates the Fed can control at\nvery low levels. As such, there was not much to be gained by maintaining our threshold\nlanguage.\nAn alternative would be to frame forward guidance in relation to achieving the goals\nconsistent with our dual mandate, within suggested timeframes. For example, the FOMC could\npromise to keep short-term interest rates at very low levels until the economy is within one year\nof reaching full employment and 2 percent inflation, based on the trends in incoming data and an\nassumption about how they will continue. Such guidance would hinge on how far the economy\nremains from levels consistent with our dual mandate and on the assumed forecasted speed at\nwhich inflation and unemployment are expected to converge to those values.\nClearly, such guidance would be highly dependent on the incoming data, and what the\ndata suggest about how quickly the economy will reach full employment and 2 percent inflation.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nGiven the uncertainty about the future course of the economy, and about the estimate of what\nconstitutes full employment, such guidance could not be precise. Nor would it provide the\ncalendar certainty that many financial participants would prefer. However, these drawbacks are\npreferable to providing forward guidance that is overly specific, and that does not take into\naccount the uncertainties – because such guidance would risk the possibility of essentially\n“locking in” mis-timed policy moves.\nFigure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of a possible “lift-off” of the short-term rates to\ndifferent assumptions about when we reach full employment. My own estimate of full\nemployment is around 5.25 percent; for other economists it can be different. However, the figure\nshows that for three different paths for the unemployment rate – one consistent with 3 percent\nGDP growth, one consistent with 2.5 percent growth, and one that mirrors the trend decline in\nunemployment over the past four years – the calendar date estimate for reaching full employment\nwould be quite different. This range of outcomes shows that differing assumptions about the\neconomy can generate very different dates for reaching my definition of full employment –\nanywhere between April 2016 and January 2020. With the uncertainties surrounding anyone’s\nforecast, and with the ambiguity in the data we have seen to date, any of these forecasts represent\nplausible outcomes.\nFigure 3 highlights a challenge with the inflation side of the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate. Despite the fall in the unemployment rate, the core inflation rate is currently 1.1\npercent, which is well below our 2 percent target. A model of inflation used at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston takes into account labor market “slack” and an expectation that inflation\nwill return to 2 percent. I would point out that the model we use generates only a very slow\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreturn to a 2 percent inflation rate. Other models may converge to 2 percent more quickly. Still,\nwhile the eventual return to 2 percent inflation is in the forecast, I see little evidence in the\ncurrent data suggesting that we are yet on this modest path to achieving the targeted 2 percent\ninflation rate.\n\nUncertainty\nWhile some uncertainty around forecasts is a given, currently the uncertainty is\ncompounded by the unusual behavior of some key economic relationships since the financial\ncrisis. For example, a strong housing rebound is an important component of most forecasts that\nsuggest that GDP growth will be stronger than the economy’s “potential” rate over the next two\nyears. The housing sector is expected to improve further because interest rates remain low by\nhistorical standards, housing prices have been rising, more workers are being employed, and\nstock market wealth has increased.\nThese housing sector factors should all make positive contributions to stronger GDP\ngrowth. However, while most forecasters expect housing to improve, the path of improvement\ndiffers greatly among forecasters. This is shown in Figure 4. While the consensus forecast is for\nrecent trends to continue improving, there are significant differences in the forecasts related to\nthe speed of the improvement.\nFigure 5 shows one of the challenges in predicting housing starts. While the U.S.\npopulation has grown at quite a consistent, smooth rate – with no visible impact from the\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession – the same is not true for the activity we call “household\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nformation.” Consider the example, often cited, of recent college graduates returning to their\nparents’ home after graduation rather than getting their own apartment. In part, the slowing in\nthe household formation trend line – you see it flattening, compared to population, beginning\naround 2007 – reflects many individuals not creating new households because of economic\ndifficulties stemming from the financial crisis and recession. Parenthetically, the chart also\nshows a pickup in the household formation rate during the housing boom that preceded the crisis.\nBut after the crisis, the rate of increase is clearly slowing relative to population.\nFigure 6 shows even more vividly how different household formation has been since the\nlast recession (shaded in gray) and the financial crisis that preceded it. Some view this change in\nhousehold formation behavior as temporary, and if so, suggest we should see significant\nincreases in household formation as economic problems subside. Alternatively, household\nformation behavior may bear sufficient scars from the recession and the slow recovery,\nindicating that the creation of households will now follow a shallower path. Unfortunately, at\nthis point either assumption could play out, and we may need to wait for more data and the\npassage of time to determine how lasting the impact of the recession is on household formation.\nHousehold formation is not the only economic indicator to show anomalous changes, and\nI will share a few of them in a moment. But to address the general issue of uncertainty, I would\nsuggest the uncertainty is heightened just now in part due to the very real possibility that typical\neconomic patterns have been altered by the financial crisis and Great Recession, their lead-up,\nand their aftermath.\nIn short, a variety of economic data have behaved differently since the recession. These\npattern shifts may reflect changes in how households and firms will react as the economy\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nimproves. It is possible that previous patterns will be re-established as the economy normalizes.\nAlternatively, “scarring” from the recession may have longer-lasting impacts if households,\nfirms, and labor markets persist in behaving in ways that differ from historical patterns. This\nuncertainty makes it particularly difficult to predict exactly what “normal” will look like – and\nwhy specific forward guidance in monetary policy becomes difficult as the economy gradually\nimproves.\nBeyond the anomaly of household formation, I would note three other such shifts in\neconomic behavior since the recession suggested in the data.\nAt non-financial corporate businesses, the level of checkable deposits and currency has\nbeen growing rapidly, as Figure 7 shows. This could represent a form of “scarring” from the\nrecession if it means that firms are less confident in raising funds from the market or financial\nintermediaries, and are now essentially more risk-averse and banking cash. While some risk\naversion is clearly vital, a growing degree of risk aversion among non-financial corporate\nbusinesses may signal subdued investment behavior by firms – behavior that would, on net, lead\nto slower economic growth.\nSimilarly, Figure 8 suggests that households, too, may have been “scarred” by the\nrecession and may now be driven more by a higher quotient of fear than before. While holding\ncash reserves for unexpected events is prudent, substantially increasing cash holdings may be\nconsistent with more risk aversion, which, in turn, may also be reflected in restrained consumer\nspending – a key component of the country’s GDP.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nSecond, as I have explored in other talks, broader gauges of the labor markets are\nshowing sizable numbers of Americans working only part time for economic reasons, as shown\nin Figure 9. Also, Figure 10 highlights the important issue of long-term unemployment. In sum,\nit is possible that the labor market may have been “scarred” in important and lasting ways by the\nrecession and painfully slow recovery.\nAnother source of uncertainty for the U.S. economy is its links overseas. Of course,\ninternational economic forces are only indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy\ndecisions in the U.S. My own assumption is that Europe, and the emerging economies, are likely\nto continue to gradually improve.\nHowever, such a forecast could change significantly if the baseline assumptions about\nEurope and emerging economies prove to be wrong. Figure 11 shows bank exposures to\nemerging markets.4 While U.S. banks have a sizable exposure to emerging markets, the\nexposure of the Euro area banks is almost triple that of U.S. banks. The United Kingdom has a\nparticularly significant exposure (despite having a much smaller economy than that of the United\nStates), given that some of the U.K. banks are particularly active in emerging markets.\nMuch of the exposure of the Euro area banks involves emerging European economies.\nWere problems in Ukraine, for example, to become much more acute, Europe would potentially\nbe impacted by its energy dependence on Russia and also through European bank exposure to\nemerging European economies. Given that European banks are still recovering from a severe\nEuropean recession, such a shock – while unlikely and not my prediction – would be most\nunwelcome.5\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nMy forecast for the U.S. economy assumes the impact of foreign linkages will be\nrelatively benign. However, the risk of foreign shocks is still large enough to remain a\nsignificant downside risk to the forecast. While I expect the economy to grow at roughly 3\npercent over the next two years, these and other uncertainties suggest that as always, it is best to\nbe quite humble about forecasting precision.\n\nConcluding Observations\nRecent incoming data continue to be consistent with a slowly improving economy. This\nimprovement is allowing the Federal Reserve to slowly pare back asset purchases and to\ngradually become less precise in our forward guidance. However, I believe there are several\nreasons to be cautious and patient before returning monetary policy to a more normal, less\naccommodative stance.\nWhile the economy has gradually improved, 6.7 percent unemployment and inflation\naround 1 percent remain far from normal economic conditions. And the broader measures of\nunderemployment tell an even more sobering story. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind\nthat negative shocks to the economy will be much more difficult to offset with monetary policy\nthan positive shocks.\nAll told, in my view, monetary policy should remain highly accommodative until the\ndomestic and global economies are on more solid footing.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, April 15, 2014 at 4:10 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe most recent figures for PCE inflation and Core PCE are 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively.\n\n2\n\nThe full statement is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.html.\n\n3\n\nSee the SEP at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20140319.pdf\n\n4\n\nMore detailed information on banks’ exposure to emerging market economies, including lists of reporting\ncountries and emerging market economies and an interactive data tool, can be found on the Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS) website, in the section on international banking statistics –\nhttp://www.bis.org/statistics/about_banking_stats.htm -- and in its publication BIS Quarterly Review\n(http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1403.htm).\n5\n\nFor European reporting countries, roughly two-thirds of the emerging European economies exposure is located in\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Russia, and Turkey.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Boston Economic Club\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 26, 2014\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is great to be back to speak at the Boston Economic Club, and I do so with my usual\nnote – that the views that I will express are mine, and do not necessarily reflect the views of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve’s Board of\nGovernors.\nI am particularly happy to have the opportunity to speak to this group given the\nabundance of questions and debates surrounding the economy these days. Indeed, much of the\nrecent discussion among economists who focus on the near-term economic outlook seems to be\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncentering on whether weakness in recent incoming data reflects just the severe winter weather or\nmore fundamental trends. While locally we have had a notable spate of snowstorms, that is to be\nexpected – New England tends to experience snowstorms in the winter. If, however, misery\nloves company, we have had plenty of companions this year. What is unusual this winter,\naccording to many retailers, is that they can usually count on bad weather in the Northeast being\noffset by good weather in the Mid-Atlantic and South – but that has not worked out this year.\nThe most recent employment report is a good example of the difficulty encountered in\ndiscerning trends from anomalies (such as weather). Payroll employment grew by a\ndisappointing 113,000 jobs in January, well below expectations. December was similarly\ndisappointing, with the addition of only 75,000 jobs.1 The average of 94,000 jobs a month over\nthe past two months stands in sharp contrast to the average of 256,000 jobs added in October and\nNovember.2\nSince the February survey took place over the week when snowstorms resulted in\nwidespread disruptions up and down the East Coast, it is likely that the February employment\nreport released next month will also be difficult to interpret – given that the movement in the\ndata was certainly influenced by Mother Nature.\nIn short, economists and policymakers face the difficulty of determining whether recent\nemployment reports are just anomalies induced by things like weather, or reflect a slowing trend\nin the economy – a pattern that we have certainly seen repeatedly since the onset of this\nrecovery. In my view, this uncertainty provides an additional strong rationale for taking a patient\napproach to removing the monetary policy accommodation that the Federal Reserve has been\ndeploying.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, today I plan to discuss another justification for a patient approach to removing\nmonetary policy accommodation. That reason is that the traditional measure of unemployment\nprobably understates the degree of “slack” remaining in labor markets and the economy more\ngenerally. My colleagues and I at the Boston Fed have been studying and speaking about these\nissues, and I would like to return to and expand upon them with you this afternoon, given their\ncentral importance at this point in time.\nWhile the unemployment rate has recently fallen to 6.6 percent, there remain 7.3 million\nAmericans who want full-time work but are currently working part time – a number that is\ndramatically higher than the 4.6 million workers in that situation in December of 2007 as the\nfinancial crisis and recession were taking hold. In contrast to the observable decline in labor\nforce participation – which prompts a debate about whether workers remain qualified and willing\nto work – this “part time for economic reasons” group involves workers who currently have jobs.\nThey have the skills to do the work, and they state that they would prefer to work full time. So\nthese individuals likely reflect a large supply of underutilized workers – an assessment that is\nsupported by other indicators of slack labor markets like the very low inflation rate, and very\nslow growth in labor compensation.\n\nRecent Economic Data\nWhile the payroll employment numbers have been disappointing of late, there has been\nbetter news in the household survey. The unemployment rate declined to 6.6 percent in January,\nand in contrast to many previous declines, this recent decline reflects more jobs rather than a\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsmaller labor force. As Figure 1 shows, the unemployment rate was 7 percent as recently as last\nNovember, so we continue to enjoy noticeable improvement in this standard measure.\nThe horizontal green line shows the 6.5 percent threshold that was first included in the\nFOMC’s policy statement for the December 2012 committee meeting, when the unemployment\nrate was 7.9 percent. This threshold was used in the form of guidance that the committee would\nnot raise short-term interest rates as long as the unemployment rate was at or above the 6.5\npercent threshold. It is important to recall that the Committee made the distinction between this\nbenchmark as a threshold – i.e., a point at which discussion about policy options should begin –\nversus a trigger – a point at which a specific policy action would automatically begin. It also\nincluded other markers that would guide the discussion, including inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nAs the unemployment rate has fallen, the Committee’s forward guidance has been\namended to state that it likely will be appropriate to maintain very low short-term interest rates\nwell past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent.3 This reflects the\nassessment that while the unemployment rate has approached the threshold, there still remains\nsignificant slack in labor markets, actual inflation remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2\npercent target, and inflation expectations remain stable. In my view, this is completely\nconsistent with the FOMC’s intended interpretation of the 6.5 percent marker as a threshold, not\na trigger.\nThe crux of my talk today is this: When we reach 6.5 percent unemployment, the\neconomy will still be characterized by significant labor market slack. I will offer several ways of\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlooking at this, including historical perspectives on the level of unemployment, as well as\nadditional measures of labor market slack.\nWith regard to historical perspective, as the green line shows, the 6.5 percent threshold\nwas set at a level higher than the highest unemployment rate reached during the 2001 recession.\nI would add that it is well above my own estimate of “full employment,” which is 5.25 percent\nunemployment. So the 6.5 percent threshold was set conservatively, to essentially serve as a\npoint where the Fed’s monetary policy committee would begin to focus on a much broader set of\neconomic variables in order to consider whether it was appropriate to begin raising short-term\ninterest rates.\nFigure 2 provides an indication of how long it might take to reach my estimate of the full\nemployment level of unemployment – 5.25 percent – under two different assumptions about the\nevolution of the unemployment rate. The first path assumes that the unemployment rate\ncontinues to decline at the same rate it has since unemployment reached 10 percent. This simple\nextrapolation (the dotted line) shows that we would reach my estimate of full employment by\nmid-2016.\nA very similar result arises in the second scenario (the dashed line), which assumes that\na simple Okun’s Law4 holds and that GDP will grow at 3 percent for the next few years,\nsomewhat above my 2 percent estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate. Of course, this\nscenario assumes that the unemployment rate is currently a good measure of labor market slack –\nand assumes that as the economy continues to improve, there will not be a large inflow of\nworkers who were waiting for stronger employment prospects before entering the workforce or\nmoving from part-time to full-time employment.5\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nUnfortunately, Figure 3 provides one reason to believe there is significant labor market\nslack not fully captured by the standard unemployment rate. A broader measure of labor market\nunderutilization is the U-6 measure of unemployment produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(the BLS). The U-6 measure includes the widely reported U-3 unemployment measure, but also\nincludes workers who are “marginally attached” to the workforce (that is, who looked for work\nin the past year but not the past 4 weeks) and individuals working part time for economic\nreasons.\nWhile there is always a difference between U-3 and U-6, as there are always some\nmarginally attached and part-time workers in the economy, the spread between the U-3 and U-6\nmeasures of unemployment has increased dramatically since the start of the financial crisis. To\nreturn to full utilization of labor as measured by this broader indicator, we will need stronger\neconomic growth – which would pull workers out of unemployment into employment – but we\nwill also need sufficient demand to see the re-employment of some of those marginally attached\nto the workforce and the conversion of many part-time workers to full-time workers.\n\nPart Time for Economic Reasons\nFigure 4 highlights the data on persons who are working part time for economic reasons.\nThe left panel shows that 7.3 million Americans are working part time but would prefer full-time\nemployment. While the number working part time for economic reasons is down from a peak of\napproximately 9 million Americans after the recession, it remains dramatically higher than was\nexperienced from 1994 until the financial crisis, and, in fact, remains well above the past few\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntimes when the most commonly used measure of unemployment stood at or near 6.5 percent.\nThe right panel shows that roughly 5 percent of the labor force includes workers who are part\ntime for economic reasons.\nThe BLS employment survey includes detailed questions on the status of part-time\nworkers, and as such is able to provide additional context. For example, the survey reports\n“slack work or business conditions” as the reason underlying the largest category of people\nworking part time for economic reasons. These are people who would be working full time if\nthere were sufficient demand, but firms have reduced their hours because of business conditions.\nFigure 5 shows that these 4.4 million workers account for roughly 3 percent of the labor force.\nNotably, the numbers in Figure 4 and 5 remain much higher than prior to the recession.\nFigure 6 shows the second-largest category of workers whose status is part-time for\neconomic reasons – those who could only find part-time work. About 2.6 million Americans\ncurrently can only find part-time work. This series does not show the same declines as those that\nhave reduced hours because of slack business conditions. And while the current reading for\nthese part-time workers is at an elevated level, it is not as dramatic as for those whose reduced\nhours stem from slack business conditions.\nFigure 7 provides the numbers working part time for economic reasons, broken out by\nindustry classification. The wholesale and retail trade and the leisure and hospitality industries\nhave the largest number of individuals working part time for economic reasons. Both are\nindustries that one might expect to be significantly impacted by a slow recovery – but also\nindustries that should be capable of adding hours for workers as business improves.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 shows that being part time for economic reasons is a problem for those\ngenerally thought to be of “prime working age” and not just the youngest and oldest workers.\nSuch workers typically demonstrate strong attachment to the labor force, with fewer spells of\nunemployment and less tendency to work part time. Prime working-age individuals follow a\npattern quite consistent with the overall figures shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 9 brings in a consideration of race and ethnicity.6 White workers show the\ngreatest decline from the recession peaks among workers who are part time for economic\nreasons. Black or African American workers have actually shown no decline in this measure,\nwhile workers of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity have seen some improvement. However, the slow\nrecovery has not only resulted in very elevated minority unemployment rates, but also made it\nmore difficult to move from part-time to full-time employment.\nOverall, I see these charts providing evidence that there remains significant slack in labor\nmarkets, above and beyond the slack usually represented by the standard unemployment (or U-3)\nrate. Observers of the economy and labor markets have been debating whether marginally\nattached workers are likely to return to the workforce – whether they left because they are\n(perhaps temporarily) discouraged, lack requisite job skills, or are less willing to work. This\ndebate suggests some uncertainty about the degree to which labor force participation rates will\nactually improve.\nHowever, the labor market slack that is revealed by the large numbers working part time\nfor economic reasons is different. Employers have hired these workers (so they have the\nnecessary skills), and they are available to work – but economic conditions have not been\nsufficiently robust to convert their part-time work to full-time work. This may indicate that the\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntrue overall slack in the labor markets is better captured by a portfolio of the unemployment\nmeasures, including the U-6 measure, rather than only the more traditional and widely reported\nU-3 measure.7\n\nOther Indications of Labor Market Slack\nAnother indication of what I believe to be significant labor market slack is the absence of\ninflationary pressures. Figure 10 shows the Summary of Economic Projections for inflation\nprovided by the presidents and governors within the Federal Reserve System. The forecasts for\n2013 inflation, made in 2011 and 2012, significantly overestimated how quickly inflation would\nreturn to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. The 1.1 percent inflation8 for 2013 was outside\nthe range of earlier forecasts, and remains well below the 2 percent inflation target set by the\nFOMC.\nFigure 11 shows that the 2 percent growth rates of wages and salaries and of total\ncompensation are well below levels experienced prior to the most recent recession. If some labor\nmarkets were already tightening, we would expect to observe more of an upward trend in wages\nand salaries and total compensation. Figure 12 shows that there is little evidence of\ncompensation pressures, even when viewed by varying occupations.\nThe evidence provided by prices and compensation corroborate my argument that there\ncontinues to be significant slack in labor markets. The absence of pricing pressure is consistent\nwith the still-elevated number of unemployed workers, as well as the very elevated number of\nworkers who are part time for economic reasons.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nAs the unemployment rate falls and approaches the 6.5 percent threshold, the Federal\nReserve needs to make an assessment of the degree of remaining labor market slack as it sets\nmonetary policy. I believe the elevated number of workers who are part time for economic\nreasons, the still-high unemployment rate, and the very low inflation rate are all consistent with\nsignificant slack in labor markets. Such conditions call for a very patient approach to removing\nmonetary policy accommodation, particularly given the softness in recent economic data.\nIt is vitally important that labor markets continue to improve. Monetary policy should\ncontinue to be accommodative, supporting a return to full employment, given the very low\ninflation rates.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe initial report of 74,000 jobs has been revised upward to 75,000.\n\n2\n\nPayroll employment increased by 237,000 jobs in October and 274,000 in November for an average of 256,000\nover the two months.\n3\n\nSee the committee statement at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140129a.htm.\n\n4\n\nFormer Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke described Okun’s Law in a 2012 speech as follows: “About 50 years ago, the\neconomist and presidential adviser Arthur Okun identified a rule of thumb that has come to be known as Okun’s\nLaw. That rule of thumb describes the observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the\ngrowth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP). Okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the size of the\nlabor force and in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rate of growth of its potential is normally\nrequired just to hold the unemployment rate steady. To reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must\ngrow at a pace above its potential. More specifically, according to currently accepted versions of Okun’s Law, to\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, February 26, 2014 at 12:30 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nachieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year, real GDP must grow\napproximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential GDP over that period. So, for\nillustration, if the potential rate of GDP growth is 2 percent, Okun’s Law says that GDP must grow at about a 4\npercent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment.”\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.pdf\n5\n\nIt is important to note that there have been large errors in Okun’s Law recently reflecting periods where the\neconomy has grown around its potential but the unemployment rate has fallen substantially.\n\n6\n\nThe BLS Table A-27 presents the following classifications: ‘White,’ ‘Black or African American,’ ‘Asian,’ and\n‘Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.’ (Data are not presented for all races.)

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNew College of Florida\n“New Topics New College” Speaker Series\nSarasota, Florida\nFebruary 6, 2014\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be at New College of Florida to see where my friend and\ncolleague Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, spent some of\nhis formative years. I would also note that New College is consistently ranked among the\ntop colleges for the combination of academic excellence and affordability – no small\nachievement in this day and age.\nTurning to my topic today, I would first like to note – as always – that the views I\nshare are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe New College location in sunny Florida seems appropriate for my message\ntoday, given that there has been some sunnier news on the economy recently. Last week,\nwe learned that the preliminary estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013\nwas 3.2 percent, and thus for the second half of 2013 real GDP growth averaged 3.7\npercent – well above the 2.4 percent average over the recovery period. Some of this\ngrowth reflects factors that will likely prove temporary, such as a rapid build-up of\ninventories and a surge in net exports. But excluding inventory fluctuations, final sales\ngrew three-quarters of a percentage point faster in the second half of 2013 than in the\npreceding 16 quarters.\nNot only has there been good news on economic growth, but the unemployment\nrate has also continued to decline – and I hope we will see another decline in tomorrow’s\nemployment report. It is certainly good news that the national unemployment rate has\nfallen from a peak of 10 percent in the post-financial crisis recession to 6.7 percent as of\nDecember. Unfortunately, not all reductions in the unemployment rate are alike. For\nexample, some are caused by rapid employment growth, while others are due to people\ngiving up looking for a job. Distinguishing which is occurring is often quite difficult.\nOne warning sign for economists is that while overall this has been a long, slow recovery,\nthe recent decline in the unemployment rate has occurred more quickly than many\nexpected.\nThe fact that other labor market indicators have not been as favorable as the\nunemployment rate suggests that the rate may be falling for both reasons. Gauged by\nthese broader measures of labor market utilization, we remain far from conditions\nexperienced prior to the so-called “Great Recession.”\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCurrently, over 20 million Americans are either unemployed, are marginally\nattached to the labor force (including discouraged workers no longer looking for work\nbecause they believe no jobs are available for them), or are working part time when they\nwould prefer full-time work. For these Americans, it is all too painfully apparent that\nlabor markets remain far from their state prior to the recession.\nThe concern that the unemployment rate alone does not fully capture the state of\nlabor market conditions is reflected in the Federal Reserve’s current stance of monetary\npolicy. In the January FOMC statement,1 the Committee reaffirmed that it likely will be\nappropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the\ntime that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent (especially if inflation\nremains so subdued).\nGiven that the unemployment rate is now approaching this 6.5 percent threshold, I\nwant to highlight why, in my view, labor-market conditions remain far from where they\nwould need to be to justify raising short-term rates. Furthermore, I will argue that\neveryone following the economy should be placing weight on the broader measures of\nlabor market underutilization. A key point that I will expand on in a moment is that these\nmeasures remain far above where they were when the Federal Reserve began raising\nshort-term rates in the previous recovery.\nAs I have often noted, a patient approach to removing accommodation is further\njustified because the inflation rate remains far below the Fed’s 2 percent target.2 Very\nsubdued inflation gives policymakers latitude to accommodate a more rapid improvement\nin labor markets, by keeping short-term rates lower for longer than is typical for\nrecoveries.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nMeasures of Underutilization in Labor Markets\nSince we are gathered today on a college campus, I hope you will indulge me a\nbrief tutorial on labor market statistics. The topic may sound a bit dry, but the\ndistinctions in the measures have major implications for policies that affect millions of\nAmericans.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a broader set of\nunemployment rates in order to capture underutilization in labor markets3 – indeed, the\ncategories were redefined in 1994, so there is a consistent series going back that far.4\nFigure 1 charts these various BLS measures of underutilization in labor markets over\ntime. Let me walk you through the chart, beginning at the bottom.\n\n\n\nThe dark blue reflects those Americans who are unemployed. This is the\nmeasure most frequently cited from the labor report. The BLS calls this its\n“U-3” definition of unemployment, which includes people who do not have\njobs but have actively searched for work over the previous four weeks.5 (In a\nmoment you will be conversant in all the “U” measures of labor market slack,\nfrom U-3 to U-6.)\n\n\n\nThe light blue area reflects so called “discouraged workers” who, together\nwith the unemployed, make up the “U-4” measure of labor market utilization.\nDiscouraged workers are not included in the narrower definition of the\nunemployed because they have not searched for work over the previous four\nweeks. They have searched for work over the previous year, but do not think\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat jobs fitting their skills or background are currently available. As of\nDecember, the BLS measured 917,000 of these discouraged workers in the\nU.S., compared to only 363,000 at the beginning of the recession in December\nof 2007.6\n\n\n\nThe green area reflects other persons whom the BLS classifies as “marginally\nattached to the labor force,” but who are not classified as discouraged\nworkers. The BLS’s “U-5” measure adds these people to the discouraged and\nunemployed workers. The other marginally attached workers are available to\nwork and have searched for work in the previous year, but have not searched\nfor work in the past four weeks and are therefore outside of the labor force.\nThey do not state that their reason for being out of the labor force is an\nabsence of available jobs.7 Issues such as family responsibilities or\ntransportation challenges may be playing a role. The BLS estimates that there\nare currently about 1.5 million Americans in this category, compared to\n981,000 in December of 2007.\n\n\n\nThe dark red area on the chart reflects persons who are working part time for\nso-called “economic reasons.”8 They are available to work full time, but have\nhad their hours reduced – or could only secure part-time work. The BLS’s\n“U-6” measure adds these people working part time for economic reasons to\nthe people in the U-5 measure. There are currently 7.8 million workers who\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nare working only part time for economic reasons, up sharply from the 4.6\nmillion in December of 2007.\n\nIn sum, Figure 1 highlights why, for many Americans, the labor market remains\nvery difficult – and why using the narrow, widely reported unemployment rate alone to\nsummarize labor market conditions could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of\naffairs. While the traditional unemployment rate is an important measure, its decline\ndoes not capture the wider difficulties in the labor market that are being felt by so many\nAmericans. My sense is that evaluation of the labor market situation requires much more\nattention to these broader measures.\n\nUsing the Broader Measures of Labor Market Utilization\nFigure 2 provides the traditional unemployment rate along with a vertical line at\nJune 2004 – the first tightening of monetary policy during the previous recovery, on June\n30, 2004. The unemployment rate at that time was 5.6 percent, and the PCE inflation rate\nover the previous year was 2.8 percent. It is revealing to contrast those with current\nconditions. We have a much higher unemployment rate (6.7 percent as of December) and\na much lower inflation rate (1.1 percent as of December).\nAlso on Figure 2, I have a horizontal line showing the average unemployment rate\nfrom January 1994 to December 2007. We are currently more than one and a half\npercentage points or about 2.5 million people above that average of the most basic and\nnarrow measure of unemployment.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 3 provides a similar chart, but uses the next broader definition of labor\nmarket underutilization. The December U-4 unemployment rate, which includes\ndiscouraged workers, was 7.2 percent. This is almost two percentage points above the\naverage for 1994 to 2007, and well above the peak after the previous recession.\nSimilarly, in Figure 4 the U-5 measure of unemployment (adding in all other\npersons marginally attached to the labor force) shows an even wider gap, 2.1 percentage\npoints, from the pre-recession average (1994 through 2007).\nI find Figure 5, using the broadest measure (U-6) that adds in those employed\npart time for economic reasons, particularly striking. Even at this point in the recovery,\nthe measure is still nearly four and a quarter percentage points or 6.5 million people\nabove the pre-recession average – a gap that is much wider than those for the other\nmeasures of unemployment.9 The large number of individuals working part time for\neconomic reasons highlights, in my view, the need for much more improvement in labor\nmarkets.\nFigure 6 compares the current reading of all these measures to their level at the\ntime of the first monetary policy tightening during the previous recovery (in June 2004).\nIt highlights how much higher all the unemployment measures are now than they were in\nJune 2004, when the FOMC first tightened rates during the previous recovery. While all\nmeasures are well above the rates in June 2004, the broadest measure of unemployment is\nparticularly far from its level then.\nFigure 7 plots the measures of labor market underutilization on one chart. Two\nimportant features stand out to me. First, the gaps between the traditional, narrow U-3\nmeasure of unemployment and all the broader measures remain wider than they were\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprior to the recession. Second, while all the measures of labor market utilization have\nimproved from their peaks, you can see that the broader the measure, the further the\ncurrent reading is from its pre-recession level.\nUnfortunately, the BLS data series of broader measures of labor market\nutilization, as currently defined, go back only to 1994. And despite the clear story I think\nthey tell, there are some important questions that have yet to be answered.\nFor example, will the broader measures of labor utilization return to pre-recession\nlevels, or does this represent a more lasting change in labor force dynamics? If it is the\nformer, it will require much more economic growth to absorb this large pool of\nunderutilized workers.\nAlso, how large an impact do these pools of underutilized workers have on wages\nand prices? On the one hand, growth in wages and prices has been very low by\nhistorical standards; on the other hand, wage and price inflation did not fall as low as\nmany predicted, given the earlier upheaval in labor markets.\nFinally, inflation of late has remained stubbornly low, even as labor market\nconditions have improved, to the surprise of many forecasters. So we need to explore the\nlink between these labor market indicators and wage and price inflation, in part to\nunderstand the likely evolution of inflation, and in part to understand to what degree we\ncan expect these measures to return to their pre-recession norms. In other words, whether\nwe have seen more permanent “scarring” of the unemployed, which might imply longerlasting effects, broadly construed. I will expand on this theme in a moment.\nAs the economy continues to improve gradually, monetary policymakers need to\ncarefully evaluate labor market conditions. My own view is that for now we will need to\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nplace greater weight on these broader measures of labor market utilization – measures\nthat are not returning to “normal” as quickly as is the more narrow U-3 measure of\nunemployment.\n\nLabor Market Slack and Inflation\nMost forecasters have expected that as labor market slack diminished, inflation\nwould move back to levels closer to the Fed’s 2 percent target. However, the actual\ninflation experience has been more subdued than forecast over the past two years. At\nleast one potential reason for this forecasting “miss” is the presence of substantial labor\nmarket slack, as shown in the broader unemployment measures.\nFigure 8 provides the midpoint of the central tendency of the inflation forecasts\nfor 2013, provided by the Federal Reserve governors and presidents in our quarterly\nSummary of Economic Projections. Back in November of 2011, the midpoint of the\ncentral tendency of the forecasts showed that Fed policymakers expected both PCE and\ncore PCE inflation to be just under 1.8 percent. As the forecasts have been updated for\nsubsequent Committee meetings, the forecast for the year-over-year inflation rate for\n2013 has continued to decline (shown by the midpoint of the central tendency of the\nforecasts, plotted on the chart). In fact, the PCE inflation rate of 1.1 percent in December\nwas much lower than was expected, even at the beginning of 2013. A similar pattern\nemerges with core PCE inflation.\nFigure 9 shows that private sector forecasts of inflation have been no more\naccurate. The Survey of Professional Forecasters reported a median expectation that the\nPCE inflation rate would be 2 percent as of November 2012. Much like the SEP, as\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neconomic data have continued to come in weaker, the Survey’s inflation forecast was\nreduced further. Even in 2013, the forecast reductions have been sizable. The Blue Chip\nconsensus forecasts show a similar pattern.\nSome argue that so-called structural unemployment has risen, by which I mean\nthat the recession has caused changes in the labor market that imply a long-term increase\nin unemployment that will not recede as the economy recovers. Many who believe that\nmuch of our unemployment is structural argue that there is little that monetary policy can\ndo if weak labor markets reflect structural rather than cyclical forces. While we cannot\ncategorically rule out the presence of some structural unemployment, I would note that if\nstructural unemployment is now much higher, then it is difficult to explain why growth in\nprices has continued to be low, both in absolute terms and relative to expectations.\nIn short, one potential explanation for persistently low price (and wage) growth\nmay be that the weakness we have just seen in the broader measures of labor markets\nbetter reflects the state of the labor market than the traditional, narrow U-3 measure of\nunemployment.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would just reiterate that the broader measures of the\nlabor market show less improvement than the more narrowly constructed U-3 measure of\nunemployment, which is widely followed and has been used in the Federal Reserve’s\nforward guidance on policy. The broader measures of unemployment are much higher\nthan they were at their peaks following the previous recession, and remain unusually high\nrelative to the traditional U-3 measure of unemployment. If we take these measures as\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nproviding important complements to the U-3 measure of labor market slack, then we\nmust acknowledge and address an even larger amount of remaining labor market slack\nthan the narrower measure indicates.\nThis is, of course, a discussion of data points and measures, but we cannot lose\nsight of matters of human toll and potential, as well.\nThe implications for monetary policy seem clear – if one believes some of the\nsignals from the broader measures of labor market slack that I have walked you through\ntoday, then we remain very far from historical average levels of labor utilization. As a\nresult, I firmly believe that monetary policymakers should remain quite patient in\nremoving accommodation. This perspective, I would add, is consistent with the recent\nFOMC statement indicating that the Committee expects short-term interest rates to\nremain low well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below the 6.5 percent\nthreshold. This policy position is also bolstered by the fact that the inflation rate has been\nwell below what most forecasters expected and well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nIn short, in light of too much labor market slack and very low inflation rates,\nmonetary policy should continue to be highly accommodative.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140129a.htm\n\n2\n\nFor inflation measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index or PCE.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 5:45 PM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n3\n\nSee Table A-15 in the BLS’s monthly Employment Situation reports, which shows these broader\nmeasures of underutilization. BLS definitions include the following: “Persons marginally attached to the\nlabor force are those who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want\nand are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months. Discouraged\nworkers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently\nlooking for work. Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available\nfor full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.”\n4\n\nIn January 1994, the Current Population Survey was redesigned to obtain more accurate and\ncomprehensive information. Among the biggest changes were changes to the definitions of discouraged\nand part-time workers.\n5\n\nThe technical notes in the BLS’s monthly Employment Situation define unemployed as follows: “People\nare classified as unemployed if they meet all of the following criteria: they had no employment during the\nreference week; they were available for work at that time; and they made specific efforts to find\nemployment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference week.” The reference week is\n“generally the calendar week that contains the 12th day of the month.”\n6\n\nWhen available, the figures quoted are the seasonally-adjusted figures which appear in the Employment\nSituation published by the BLS. The BLS does not seasonally adjust the figures for discouraged workers\nand other marginally attached workers, so these quoted figures are not seasonally adjusted. However, for\nuse in Figure 1, the two series have been seasonally adjusted to appear with the seasonally-adjusted series\nfor unemployed and part-time workers which have strong seasonal components.\n7\n\nA BLS “Issues in Labor Statistics” publication from 2009 notes characteristics of the marginally attached:\nsee http://www.bls.gov/opub/ils/pdf/opbils74.pdf, especially Table 2.\n\n8\n\nThe BLS definition of Part-Time for Economic Reasons is as follows: “Refers to those who worked 1 to\n34 hours during the reference week for an economic reason such as slack work or unfavorable business\nconditions, inability to find full-time work, or seasonal declines in demand.”\n9\n\nThe current U-6 rate was 13.1 percent for December, in contrast to 8.8 percent in December of 2007.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the “Economic Summit & Outlook 2014”\nconference, hosted by the Connecticut Business &\nIndustry Association and the MetroHartford Alliance\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 7, 2014\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to once again participate in your economic summit\nand outlook event.\nI have had the opportunity to speak at your event during the depths of the\nrecession, during the extended tepid phase of the slow recovery, and now when we hope\nthe recovery is gaining traction – hopefully growing faster than its so-called “potential,”\nwhich would mean a more rapid return to full employment and to the Federal Reserve’s 2\npercent inflation target.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAll of us who follow the economy have been waiting for the drag from fiscal\nausterity to wane, for consumers to regain confidence and increase demand, and for the\nhousing market to solidify its nascent recovery. These represent the underlying drivers in\nmost forecasts that expect 3 percent growth beginning this year – a view I share. Three\npercent GDP growth is also consistent with stronger employment growth and declines in\nthe unemployment rate – which would continue a pattern of improvement that we have\nbeen seeing of late.\nToday I will briefly summarize current economic conditions, which have recently\nbeen improving and suggest positive news for the 2014 outlook. Then I will discuss my\nviewpoint that, despite this improvement, we remain far from where we need to be.\nInflation, both in the U.S. and in many developed countries, is lower than the targets set\nby central banks. The very low inflation rate is a concern in its own right, as I will\ndiscuss, but it should also give U.S. policymakers another reason to remain patient in\nremoving monetary accommodation – patience I counsel because the U.S. remains far\nfrom what I and most others consider a level of unemployment that represents “full\nemployment.”\nHigh unemployment has obvious human and economic costs. But prolonged\nunemployment – a long spell of joblessness – is damaging in additional ways. High\nunemployment implies personal hardship suffered by the many who are unemployed, and\ntheir families. Prolonged unemployment can cause longer-lasting damage to individuals\nif skills atrophy, and also “leave marks” on the labor market and economy more broadly,\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlong after the recovery is complete. These long-term labor markets scars, which result\nfrom a very slow recovery, lead me to believe that the Federal Reserve should remain\nhighly accommodative and wind down our extraordinary programs only very gradually,\nin order to minimize the costs and risks of not returning to full employment more quickly.\n\nI. Current Economic Conditions\n\nSince the fall of 2013, the “tone” of the incoming economic data has improved in\ntwo respects. First, data for the most recent months have generally come in stronger.\nSecond, we have seen a number of positive revisions to data released earlier.\nPayroll employment data are a good example of this dynamic. Figure 1 shows,\nfor example, that the August and September numbers were revised upward with each\nsubsequent release date; and three-month averages, having dipped with the August,\nSeptember, and October releases, have rebounded to levels around 200,000 per month.\nThus, the combination of new data and data revisions has given us more confidence in\npositive momentum in labor markets as we go into 2014.\nFigure 2 provides the national unemployment rate. We currently have a 7 percent\nU.S. unemployment rate, well down from the cyclical peak of 10 percent. While this\ncertainly represents significant improvement, we should keep in mind some other\nsobering facts about the labor market. First, some of the improvement in the\nunemployment rate reflects discouraged workers leaving the formal workforce. Second,\nit is worth remembering that the current unemployment rate still remains higher than the\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nunemployment rate peak of the previous cycle, and well above my estimate of the full\nemployment rate – which I consider to be about 5.25 percent unemployment.\nOf late, we have seen additional data that are consistent with faster GDP growth\nin 2014 than we have experienced so far in this recovery. One issue that contributes to\nthis more optimistic outlook is the likely decrease in fiscal drag in 2014. In part, this\nreflects confidence that the federal budget agreement will avoid a further fiscal disruption\n(although the debt ceiling still must be increased). Figure 3 shows that while\ngovernment spending (a component of GDP) has been a drag on GDP growth through\nmuch of this recovery, the growth of real government spending was slightly positive for\nthe third quarter. This represents a significant change from the previous three quarters,\nalthough much of the improvement was in state and local spending and we all know the\nfederal picture remains unsettled.\nAlong with less fiscal drag, most forecasters expect consumers to increase\nspending. There is already evidence of reasonably strong growth in consumption in the\nfourth quarter of 2013. As it has become more likely that disruptive fiscal problems will\nbe avoided, consumer confidence has rebounded from the declines that accompanied the\nshutdown of the federal government in 2013, as shown in Figure 4.\nFurthermore, key financial conditions that typically support consumer spending\nhave continued to improve. The stock market, represented by the Dow 30 Industrials\nshown in Figure 5, rose significantly in 2013. Together with higher home values and\nimprovements in employment, consumers should be better situated to spend in 2014 than\nin 2013.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nII. The Economy in Relation to Where We Need to Be\n\nDespite the improving situation shown in recent data, the economy remains far\nfrom where we would like it to be. Figure 6 shows that the current economic situation\nstill leaves wide employment and inflation gaps. With the unemployment rate at 7\npercent, we remain well above my estimate of full employment, 5.25 percent. The total\nPCE inflation rate is 0.9 percent, well below the 2 percent target that the FOMC has\nadopted. In short, the Federal Reserve continues to miss both elements of its dual\nmandate from Congress – inflation and employment – by fairly large margins. With\nunemployment too high and inflation too low, there is ample justification for maintaining\na highly accommodative stance for monetary policy that can help us more quickly return\nto an economy with full employment and the targeted 2 percent inflation rate.\n\nIII. Inflation\n\nFigure 7 shows various inflation measures. It is striking that over the past two\nyears, and well after the trough of the recession, we are continuing to experience a\ndeceleration in inflation across such a wide range of inflation indices. Most forecasters\nare expecting that with well-anchored expectations and reductions in what economists\ncall “resource slack,” inflation will indeed move toward the 2 percent target – but that\noutcome has yet to clearly appear in the data. The longer we remain below the 2 percent\ntarget, the greater the risk that this lower inflation rate will start to be reflected in lower\ninflation expectations. I will discuss why this is problematic in a moment.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 shows how prices would have evolved if inflation had continued at 2\npercent from the cyclical peak in 2007. In contrast, actual total PCE prices have grown\nless than 2 percent, and the core measure of PCE (which sets aside the volatile food and\nenergy sectors that the Fed cares about but cannot control) is even further below that\nhypothetical 2 percent inflation path – and the divergence from the 2 percent path appears\nto be widening. Some have pointed to temporary factors as the likely cause of low\ninflation in the U.S., but Figure 9 gives me pause in considering that interpretation. The\nfigure shows that low inflation rates have, of late, been characteristic not only of the U.S.\nbut of many advanced economies.\nPersistently low inflation rates can be a problem for several reasons. First, at very\nlow inflation rates, a sizable negative shock to the economy can result in negative\ninflation – deflation – which can become entrenched in expectations, leading to a\nprotracted period of deflation. This is what occurred in Japan in the 1990s, and Japan’s\ndeflationary situation has persisted ever since. To finally exit the deflationary\nenvironment, Japanese monetary policymakers have needed to take extraordinary\nmeasures this past year. Such extraordinary measures – during a period where most\ncentral banks have already been unusually inventive – highlight just how difficult it can\nbe to reach inflation targets once very low inflation expectations have become embedded.\nA second concern with low inflation is the implication that real short-term interest\nrates may remain too high. Figure 10 shows measures of real short-term interest rates.\nWith short-term nominal interest rates bound at zero, the inflation rate is what determines\nthe real short-term interest rate. With inflation low and nominal interest rates at zero,\nadditional declines in inflation – such as those that have occurred in the past year – raise\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nshort-term real interest rates further, likely restraining growth and making it more\ndifficult to attain the growth rate that is needed to more quickly normalize a struggling\neconomy.\nThus, inflation rates persistently below the stated target can be a cause for real\nconcern. Furthermore, persistently low inflation can theoretically undermine the\ncredibility of the central bank – if the central bank announces an inflation target but is\nunable to achieve that target in a reasonable time frame, some may call into question its\nability to do so in the medium- or long-term as well.\n\nIV. Unemployment\n\nIt can also be quite costly to have only slow improvement in labor markets.\nFigure 11 shows the so-called “quits rate,” which measures the fraction of workers who\nvoluntarily leave their job. The quits rate is more likely to rise when workers are\nconfident that they can improve their labor market position by switching jobs. When jobs\nare plentiful, workers are more likely to change jobs if they feel they are underpaid or can\nimprove their future prospects by changing jobs.\nHowever, the quits rate, while somewhat improved relative to that in the depths of\nthe recession, is still well below the levels that occurred before the financial crisis. With\nworkers concerned about job opportunities, there continues to be a reluctance to leave\ncurrent employers – despite the fact that real wages for many employees have shown\nlittle improvement during this recovery.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAnother indicator of the generally weak labor market is the low employment-topopulation ratio. While the overall employment-to-population ratio can change for\ndemographic reasons, Figure 12 focuses on the employment-to-population ratio for\nindividuals between the ages of 25 and 54. This age range captures the prime working\nage for most people, and includes the period when most people are finished with school\nand not yet planning to retire. Even within this fixed age cohort, employment has grown\nonly fast enough to keep up with population growth, suggesting little evidence of a robust\nrecovery in labor markets for this prime working-age group.\nMoreover, Figure 13 shows that long-term unemployment has been unusually\nprevalent during the most recent recession and the ensuing recovery. Despite the falling\nunemployment rate I mentioned earlier, the percentage of workers that have experienced\nlong-duration unemployment remains well above the experience in previous recessions\nand recoveries. This partly reflects that economic recoveries have tended to be more\nrobust than this one, so workers were able to more quickly regain employment.\nIn sum, while there has been improvement in some measures of the labor market,\nthese figures highlight that the labor market remains far from where it needs to be. A\nvery slow recovery risks a more permanent loss of workers from the formal labor force,\nas skills atrophy and workers stop assuming that jobs matching their skills are available.\nThus, policymakers need to consider the cost of a slow recovery relative to the risk of\ntaking actions that would more quickly return the economy to full employment.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 8:40 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nV. Concluding Observations\n\nIn December, the FOMC decided to pare back the central bank’s bond purchase\nprogram – from $85 billion a month to $75 billion a month. However, the FOMC\nstatement made clear that the process of reducing accommodation would be gradual, and\nthat short-term interest rates were likely to remain at the zero lower bound well past the\ntime the unemployment rate fell below the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold. I\ncertainly believe that a very gradual normalization is very appropriate given that the\nunemployment rate remains unusually high and the inflation rate remains unusually low.\nAs I have discussed today, there are significant costs to a slow recovery. It poses\ngreat strains on unemployed workers (and their families) who might be returning to work\nmore quickly if the economy grew faster. It can potentially have longer-lasting and\nstructural implications for labor markets and the economy. There may also be an impact\non the Federal Reserve’s ability to reach its inflation target in a reasonable time frame.\nAs the economy continues to improve, we should reduce and ultimately remove\nthe unusual support that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has provided. But this\nsupport should be removed only gradually. This recovery has already been too slow, and\nwe do not want premature tightening of monetary policy to delay the return to more\nnormal economic conditions.\nThank you, and best wishes for 2014.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJanuary 4, 2014\n\nIt is a pleasure to be at the American Economic Association’s annual meeting, and\nin particular to take part in this panel discussion along with colleagues who head up other\nReserve Banks and our distinguished moderator.*\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n*\n\nThe panel, moderated by Stanley Fischer of the Council on Foreign Relations, includes William Dudley\n(Federal Reserve Bank of New York), Narayana Kocherlakota (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis),\nCharles Plosser (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia), and Eric Rosengren.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe title of this session is “Economics at the Federal Reserve Banks.” One of the\ngreat advantages of having twelve distinct reserve banks in the Federal Reserve System is\nthat it allows for a diversity of views to flourish. While a range of views could, of\ncourse, develop under a more centralized system, it would depend on the willingness of\nFed leadership to foster dissenting opinions. While that has certainly been the case\nrecently, it arguably has not always been so during our 100 year history.\nIn many respects, the Federal Reserve System was designed to encourage the\nexpression of diverse views, given the federated structure consisting of independent\nregional reserve banks and a Presidentially nominated Board of Governors in\nWashington. Diversity of views is particularly useful during a period of changing\nparadigms, and when substantially new facts confront the economics profession. In\nrecent years, we experienced a so-called “Great Moderation” and a “Great Recession,” so\nthere has been no shortage of topics in need of further investigation – and, I would add, a\nneed for a healthy dose of humility about how well the profession’s models fit actual\nexperience.\nToday I will take up our moderator’s invitation to provide a few examples of\nways the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (the Boston Fed) has tried to provide a\ndistinctive perspective on economic issues. The Boston Fed has had a tradition of active\ninvolvement in a variety of policy areas over the years. For example, in the past the\nBoston Fed was proactive in looking at such issues as discrimination in mortgage\nlending1 and the role of credit crunches in transmitting financial shocks to the real\neconomy.2 Today, however, I will focus on some more recent work – work done over the\ncourse of the last six years or so.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI will first discuss how the Boston Fed focused on problems emerging in the real\nestate sector during the early stages of the financial crisis, which in turn led us to try out a\nnew role for a Reserve Bank – hosting large mortgage foreclosure events designed to\nbring borrowers and lenders together to address mortgage delinquency problems.\nNext, I will mention some of our work on financial stability, with a particular\nfocus on money market mutual funds. During the financial crisis, the Boston Fed was the\nonly Reserve Bank outside of New York to host a Federal Reserve System emergency\nliquidity facility – specifically the AMLF (the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money\nMarket Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility). That experience underscored for us the\nimportance of trying to prevent the need for such interventions in the future. Our\ncontinuing research on money market funds has resulted in published studies, op-ed\npieces, comment letters, and speeches seeking to encourage the reform of financial\nstructures that continue to pose systemic issues.\nFinally, I will discuss monetary policy. The Boston Fed has been, and remains,\nfocused on both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress – employment as\nwell as inflation. We have highlighted the high costs related to being below full\nemployment for a long period of time. And we have strongly argued that policymakers\nshould be as concerned about inflation being too low as being too high, given the toll and\npersistence of deflation were it to emerge. The analytical work done by the Boston Fed’s\nResearch department on these issues has also informed my choice to dissent twice as an\nFOMC member – first because of concern that financial shocks were going to have a\nmuch larger impact than many anticipated in December 2007; and again last month, to\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nadvocate for a patient approach to removing accommodation since the economy\ncontinues to have unemployment that is too high and inflation that is too low.\n\nMortgage Foreclosure Issues\nIn 2007, the Boston Fed’s Regional and Community Outreach staff documented\nhow foreclosures were disproportionately impacting low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods around New England. These concerns were also surfacing in discussions\nwith community development experts serving on our external advisory groups.\nAlso, staff in our research area began investigating the increase in foreclosure\nactivity.3 Much of that research highlighted that the behavior of home prices was critical\nto understanding the foreclosure crisis. As Figure 1 highlights, while home prices had\nfallen in some regions of the country in the early 1990s, for all sections of the country to\nexperience falling home prices simultaneously was unusual. Families experiencing a\n“life event” such as an unemployment spell, a divorce, or health issues in a rising\nhousing market can sell their house. However, those same problems occurring during a\nperiod of falling housing prices often resulted in foreclosure. Many underestimated or\nignored the potential for housing prices to fall nationally – something outside of recent\nhistorical experience. This proved problematic not only for individuals and families, of\ncourse, but also for a variety of financial instruments that were designed to perform well\nwhen housing prices were rising, but could generate large losses if housing prices fell.\nI highlighted the research being done at the Bank on these sorts of residential real\nestate problems in speeches I gave soon after becoming president of the Boston Fed.4 We\nalso decided to pursue large-scale mortgage foreclosure prevention workshops. We held\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe first of these at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, and thousands of\nresidential borrowers came to work with lenders in an attempt to prevent foreclosure (see\nFigure 2). The long lines of borrowers underscored for the Boston Fed and other\nReserve Banks that there was an opportunity to reach more distressed borrowers – and to\nfocus policy discussions on more comprehensive ways to address these problems.\n\nFinancial Stability\nAnother area of focus that has been important and somewhat distinguishing for\nthe Boston Fed is financial stability. The Boston Fed had always been attuned to less\ntraditional financial intermediaries, such as money market mutual funds, because of the\nprevalence of such entities in New England. However, that longstanding interest took on\ngreat urgency when problems at a money market mutual fund, the Reserve Primary Fund,\nin the wake of the Lehman failure led to a run on prime money market mutual funds,\nillustrated in Figure 3.\nWith the run picking up steam, we worked closely with colleagues from the Board\nof Governors on ways in which the Federal Reserve might provide an emergency\nliquidity facility to stabilize the money market mutual fund industry, to prevent further\ncollateral damage – including potential collateral damage to a wide range of companies\nthat depended on money market funds purchasing their short-term debt to fund their\noperations. The result was that by the end of the week a new emergency credit facility\nwas established, a call center to operate the facility was created within the Boston Fed,\nand the facility was up and running by the following Monday. The facility administered\nby the Boston Fed – the AMLF – provided loans on asset-backed commercial paper that\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbanks purchased from money market mutual funds. Within the first 10 days of operation,\nlending under the AMLF grew rapidly – reaching a peak of over $150 billion on October\n1, as shown in Figure 4. This program, along with the provision of insurance for money\nmarket funds by the federal government, helped stop runs that were seriously disrupting\nshort-term credit markets.5\nThe crisis experience spurred interest in identifying and putting in place\nregulations that could help avoid a repetition of the problems experienced and the need\nfor emergency measures. Boston Fed analysts studied publicly available reports and\ndisclosures, and found that fund sponsors provided substantial support for money market\nfunds to avoid numerous occasions of funds “breaking the buck.” This underlines the\nfact that the funds’ current structure poses significant financial stability concerns.6 The\nPresidents of all the Reserve Banks jointly signed two comment letters advocating\nregulatory reform of the money market fund industry.7 I also contributed two op-ed\npieces in The Wall Street Journal advocating for reducing the financial stability risk\nposed by the current structure of money market mutual funds.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe Boston Fed has long been data driven when it comes to monetary policy –\nand willing to proactively advocate policy, based on the data and our empirical analysis.\nIn our research and our public speeches, we have argued for a balanced approach to the\ndual mandate and have supported flexible inflation targeting. Research by our staff on\ninflation and employment dynamics has provided a strong empirical foundation for the\nmonetary policy positions of the Boston Fed.8\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWith regard to inflation targeting, our research, speeches and policy actions have\nhighlighted that monetary policymakers should be concerned about inflation being both\ntoo low as well as too high.9 As Figure 5 shows, over the past two years most measures\nof U.S. inflation have been trending down, and all are below the 2 percent target that the\nFederal Reserve reaffirmed at the beginning of last year. With the inflation rate below\ntarget and the unemployment rate significantly above target, we believe strongly that\nmonetary policymakers have the opportunity to be patient in removing accommodation,\nspeeding up the process of achieving both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate. This was\none of the motivations for my dissenting vote at the last FOMC meeting.\nEven if we were not significantly undershooting our inflation target, there would\nstill be a significant argument for monetary policy remaining highly accommodative.\nThe theme of our Bank’s April 2013 research conference was “Fulfilling the Full\nEmployment Mandate.” In sum, the conference highlighted how far the U.S. remains\nfrom full employment – and the costs of not returning to full employment more quickly.\nIndeed, as Figure 6 shows, the percent of those who are unemployed and have\nbeen so for more than six months has been unusually high during this recession and\nrecovery, and remains well above the peak of previous recessions. Long-term\nunemployment has significant negative effects for individuals of course, but also the\neconomy – for example through the atrophy of skills. So the failure of monetary and\nfiscal policy to generate a more rapid recovery risks creating a long-term structural\nunemployment problem out of a severe cyclical downturn. This concern also underlies\nmy dissent at the last FOMC – because, in my view, the risks from generating a more\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrapid recovery seem small relative to the risks from generating a more permanent\nincrease in structural unemployment.\n\nConcluding Observations\nI have discussed three examples of ways the Boston Fed has tried to make unique\npolicy contributions within the Federal Reserve System. Moreover, my footnotes contain\ncitations illustrating that we also make academic contributions by publishing our research\non these topics, as well as many other topics that I do not have time to highlight today, in\nthe top economics and finance journals.\nHowever, as I hope my remarks have illustrated, we have tried to advance not\nonly diversity of thought in the Federal Reserve System, but also diversity of actions.\nThe work that I have highlighted today illustrates our belief that data-driven research of\nthe type that can appear in major professional journals can also inform and guide policy\nactions – in monetary policy, supervisory policy, financial stability policy, and the\neconomy more broadly. Ultimately, our hope is to make a positive difference in these\nimportant areas.\nFinally, I would add that our work at the Boston Fed has benefitted significantly\nfrom our interactions with the rich academic community in New England. Most of the\narticles I have cited in my footnotes have multiple authors. We value collaboration with\nthe academic community, and there are certainly important topics that would benefit from\nfurther academic work and collaboration. Let me provide some quick examples from the\nthree areas I have discussed today:\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n\n\nIn the area of residential real estate, there remains much to be learned about\nwhat generates real estate bubbles, and why the rapid appreciation of real\nestate in countries around the world has generated collapses in some countries\nwhile other countries have seen little or no pull-back after rapid appreciation.\n\n\n\nIn the area of financial stability, statistical models can help us identify and\nunderstand unusual occurrences and patterns up to a point – but when\ncommon assumptions prove wrong and historical relationships break down,\nserious and damaging problems can emerge. We should ask ourselves how\nvarious parties could do a better job of considering potential outlier\nexperiences, and incorporate their risks into the ways financial institutions are\nled and managed (and supervised).\n\n\n\nAnd in the area of monetary policy, the dynamics of inflation both during and\nfollowing the recession have presented puzzles. For instance, why is inflation\nboth here and abroad remaining stubbornly low today, even as the economic\nrecoveries in the U.S. and the Euro area strengthen, in part boosted by highly\naccommodative monetary policy? In Boston, we have examined the extent to\nwhich a number of factors might explain recent behavior – time-variation in\nthe slope of the Phillips curve, a reduced impact of relative prices (especially\noil) on inflation, survey measures as proxies for short-run and long-run\ninflation expectations, and downward nominal wage rigidities. While these\nfactors appear to provide partial explanations, no effects singly or severally\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, January 4, 2014 at 10:15 AM Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprovide a complete accounting of recent inflation behavior. Given these\nuncertainties about inflation dynamics, we have reason to have less\nconfidence than usual in the inflation forecasts from our suite of models,\nmany of which would suggest a gradual rise toward the Fed's inflation target\nin coming quarters. This makes the current low level of inflation more\ntroubling from the perspective of risk management. So, in short, we need to\nbetter understand inflation dynamics.\n\nWe will continue to benefit from the work of many of you in the audience.\nHopefully the diversity of thought and actions that stems from the federated Federal\nReserve System will continue to make our policymaking process resilient – especially in\nlight of the uncertainties we continue to face.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the following:\n\n“Redlining in Boston: Do Mortgage Lenders Discriminate Against Neighborhoods?” Geoffrey\nM.B.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Financial Stability Institute of the\nBank for International Settlements:\nProgram for Financial Sector Supervisors\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\nNovember 18, 2013\n\nI would like to thank the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Arab Monetary Fund,\nand the Financial Stability Institute for inviting me to speak today. I would also like to commend\nJosef Tosovsky and the staff of the Financial Stability Institute for facilitating these global discussions\non very important bank-supervision and bank-regulation issues. Comparing implementation\nchallenges and sharing best practices in supervision and regulation are increasingly important in a\nglobal financial system, so gatherings like this are welcome. Indeed, we have been reminded in\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nrecent years that significant banking and financial problems in one country can have serious\nramifications that are far removed from the source of the original problem.\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my colleagues at the\nBoard of Governors or on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nToday I will focus my comments on bank capital requirements, an area where we have made\nsubstantial progress – but also an area that has become increasingly complex. A particular challenge\nwith this added complexity is the difficulty in providing a transparent picture of the banking\norganization’s financial health when many of the calculations involve very granular, firm-specific\ninformation.\nThis complexity poses difficulties not only for the management of banking organizations and\ntheir supervisory agencies, but also for investors and, importantly, the public. When the regulatory\nenvironment becomes more difficult for investors to understand, the efficacy of market discipline can\nerode. Market discipline requires at very least that investors and the public can clearly understand the\nfinancial condition of firms. As a result, too much complexity may be costly.\nTransparent financial disclosures that promote effective monitoring of financial condition are\nvital. In a supervisory context, market signals can be an important tool for bank supervisors. Indeed,\nduring the financial crisis, market signals provided timely and useful information about the condition\nof financial institutions. Like others, I carefully examined stock price movements, subordinated debt\nspreads, availability of wholesale funding, and credit default swap spreads to better understand how\nmarkets were assessing the financial condition of institutions – and whether the market assessment\nwas at variance with what could be observed in supervisory reports.\nThe complexity of capital regulation is readily apparent in the annual reports and financial\nstatements of the largest U.S. banking organizations. The regulatory and capital sections often extend\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nfor more than 20 pages, consisting of dense discussions of capital regulation and measurement. While\nsome of this necessarily reflects the complicated nature of the business of global banking, I think it\nwould be beneficial to look for ways to streamline discussions in order to focus investors and the\npublic on those factors most relevant to the financial solvency of the firm.\nAllow me to preview some of the main points I will discuss today:\n\n\nI will argue that the increased attention on sufficient high-quality capital for banking\norganizations is extremely important, and represents an important “lesson learned and\napplied” coming out of the financial crisis. In the United States, this increased attention\nhas resulted in a significant increase in the quantity and quality of capital that most U.S.\nbanking organizations have on hand to withstand possible future shocks.\n\n\n\nI will suggest that at least some of the complexity could, and probably should, be reduced\nif the so-called “Pillar 3” goals of increased transparency and market discipline are to be\nachieved.\n\n\n\nI will argue that, because of the variety of banking models and their associated risks, both\nrisk-based capital requirements and leverage-based capital requirements are likely to\ncontinue to be needed. Consider the fact that the capital ratios of the largest banking\norganizations are comparable to those of the wider group of bank holding companies with\nmore than $50 billion in assets when using risk-based capital – but are low relative to\nthose banking organizations when using the leverage ratio.\n\n\n\nI will note that a number of the largest global banking organizations have significant\nbroker-dealer operations and are highly dependent on wholesale funding. This funding\nstructure makes them inherently more susceptible to runs, suggesting that their relatively\nlow leverage-ratio capital may not be appropriate. I would note that Federal Reserve\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nGovernor Dan Tarullo has focused on the dependence on wholesale financing in several\nspeeches, and on the need for higher capital charges for institutions that are heavily reliant\non this less stable funding model.1\n\nThe Financial Crisis and Capital Regulation\nOne of the positive things to emerge from the financial crisis of 2008 was a renewed emphasis\non increasing the quantity and quality of the capital cushion in the banking system. Enhancements to\ncapital requirements played an important role in forcing firms to increase capital. New supervisory\ntools have been critically important as well. In particular, the stress tests that require banking\norganizations to consider whether they have sufficient capital under stress scenarios designed by bank\nsupervisors have, in many cases, provided significant impetus to improve capital positions.\nAs is shown in Figure 1, since the financial crisis the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio has\nincreased significantly for bank holding companies of all sizes.2 This improvement in a relatively\nnarrowly defined capital measure has led to the presence of significantly more loss-absorption\ncapabilities than U.S. banks had, prior to the crisis.\nWhile the increased attention to improving the size and quality of capital positions of banking\norganizations should reduce insolvency risks at many institutions and enhance the ability of the\neconomy to sustain negative shocks, this attention has also generated a much more complicated set of\ncapital regulations. An examination of the 2012 annual reports of the largest banking organizations\nhighlights just how complicated capital regulations have become. It is not unusual for the largest\nbanks to devote considerable space in their annual reports, or separate papers, to discuss at length the\nregulatory environment and their implementation of capital regulations. This complexity makes\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nevaluations of banks’ financial conditions challenging and makes it more difficult to make\ncomparisons across banking organizations.\nThe complexity stems from several factors. First, many firms report on their positions relative\nto Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III capital requirements. This reflects the fact that Basel I is the current\ncapital regulation in the United States, but some of the largest firms are discussing Basel II capital\nrequirements that they are running in parallel, and most large banking organizations are now also\nreporting what they expect their capital position will be under Basel III.\nThis is primarily a transition problem, but the transition to full implementation of Basel III is\nnot scheduled to be completed internationally for another five years. A possible simplification over\ntime might be that once large banking organizations are fully compliant with Basel III, they no longer\nalso report capital under earlier frameworks. That said, once Basel III has been fully adopted,\nsignificant complexity will still remain.3\nA second form of complexity results from the variety of measures of capital. Figure 2\nhighlights the variety of capital being used. Tier 1 common equity is generally the narrowest\ndefinition of capital reported, focusing on those elements of capital best able to absorb losses. Tier 1\ncapital is less narrow. Total risk-based capital has an even broader definition.4 The leverage ratio\nuses Tier 1 capital but is relative to a measure close to average total assets, rather than risk-weighted\nassets.\nU.S. Basel III implementation will include a supplementary leverage ratio – the ratio of Tier 1\ncapital to total leverage exposure – of at least 3 percent for large global banks. This ratio broadens the\ndenominator from average total assets to total leverage exposure. Also under consideration for the\nlargest global banks is an additional Tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio, for a total of 5 percent.5\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOne potential simplification would be to focus only on the narrower definition of capital, Tier\n1 common equity. During the financial crisis, investors and regulators focused on narrow definitions\nof capital, given the urgency around loss absorption capabilities. Potentially de-emphasizing the\nreporting of the broader measures of capital would simplify financial statements, and would create\nmore focus on the capital base with the best loss-absorption capability – where investors and\nregulators should likely concentrate.\nA third form of complexity emerges from the complications involved in risk-weighting assets\nfor risk-based capital calculations. Making capital ratios more risk sensitive has the benefit of\ndiscouraging shifts to riskier assets as a means to maximize near-term profitability at the expense of\nfuture viability. However, the need to rely on models and judgment gives rise to complexity and\nperpetuates the challenges of comparability across firms that may use very different risk models – and\nsome of those models may be in different stages of development. In fact, a recently published paper\nassociated with the Basel process has sparked discussion of whether greater simplification would be\ndesirable.6\nA fourth form of complexity stems from the use of both risk-based capital ratios and leverage\nratios. But the need for both capital ratios reflects in part the complexity of banking organizations’\nactivities. In other words if all banking organizations had similar business models, it might not be\nnecessary to use both ratios.\nFor a banking organization that primarily takes deposits and makes loans, its reliance on\nwholesale funding is low, the risk of runs is limited by deposit insurance, and much of the risk to the\ninstitution derives from the riskiness of its loan portfolio. However, many global banking\norganizations have concentrated their operations in less traditional banking activities. For example,\nmany global banking organizations have large broker-dealer operations. In this case they are heavily\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nreliant on wholesale funding, they have few deposits covered by deposit insurance, and their greatest\nrisk is that the wholesale financing they need in order to fund (i.e., to keep rolling over) their\nsecurities portfolio during a crisis will not be available, causing a severe liquidity problem.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the liabilities of bank holding companies with broker-dealer operations\ncan be quite different from those of bank holding companies without broker-dealer operations, given\nthe former’s dependence on wholesale funding rather than deposits. This makes the likelihood of\nliability runs dependent on a firm’s business model, with those firms reliant on wholesale funding\nmuch more likely to experience a liability run during a crisis. New liquidity measures will reduce\nsome of the mismatch, but given the importance of financing long-term securities with short-term\nfinancing as part of the business model, the new liquidity measures may not be sufficient. Larger\ncapital positions for firms with a business model reliant on wholesale funding will help to further\nreduce the likelihood of a liability run.\nI would now like to delve further into this difference for large banking organizations.\n\nLeverage and Risk-based Capital Requirements\nBroker-dealers tend to hold large securities portfolios, many of which carry low risk weights\nbecause the risk weighting is based on credit risk – that is, default risk. Less capital is required for\nassets with a lower risk weighting. Because of the low risk weighting on their primary assets, brokerdealers tend to have high risk-based capital ratios.\nHowever, for these organizations the riskiness of their assets is significantly compounded by\nthe riskiness of their funding model – that is, the risk that their short-term financing, accomplished\nthrough repurchase agreements and other wholesale funding arrangements, might dry up with a\nfinancial shock and not be available to finance their longer-term securities portfolio. Should investors\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nlose confidence in these firms, broker-dealers can be forced to sell securities at fire-sale prices,\ncausing solvency and liquidity concerns.\nThese concerns are far from theoretical, in that many difficulties in the fall of 2008 stemmed\nfrom runs on institutions that were reliant on wholesale funding – and many of those firms failed or\nwere acquired. I would add that some of the largest U.S. global banking organizations have\nsignificant broker-dealer operations, some of which were acquired during the financial crisis.\nFigure 4 shows the Tier 1 common equity capital position of U.S. bank holding companies by\nasset size. Bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion in assets appear relatively well\ncapitalized relative to smaller bank holding companies. Most of the large bank holding companies\nhave more than 10 percent Tier 1 common equity capital relative to risk-weighted assets. Figure 5\nshows that this is true for even the largest bank holding companies. Nine of the ten largest U.S. bank\nholding companies have Tier 1 common equity capital ratios over 10 percent.7\nFigure 6 shows the leverage ratio of U.S. bank holding companies, by asset size. The largest\nbank holding companies do not appear as well capitalized when using the leverage ratio, which does\nnot use risk-weighted assets as a denominator. More of the bank holding companies with greater than\n$50 billion in assets have less than 8 percent leverage ratio capital compared with smaller bank\nholding companies.\nFigure 7 shows that the 10 largest bank holding companies have among the lowest leverage\nratios of the largest bank holding companies. Six of the ten have leverage ratios below 8 percent.\nThis is not reflected in other large bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets; most\nof these banks have leverage ratios above 8 percent.\nFigures 8 and 9 illustrate one of the reasons for this difference. The 10 largest US\ndomestically owned bank holding companies are categorized by the relative importance of their\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nbroker-dealer operations. Those with very large broker-dealer operations tend to be high on the Tier 1\ncommon equity ratio, but low on the leverage ratio. Given the risks that broker-dealer funding models\npose, and the failure of many of the large broker-dealers during the crisis, it would seem appropriate\nthat these organizations should be holding more capital. Certainly one way to achieve this would be\nto impose capital charges for bank holding companies highly reliant on wholesale funding.\nThese differences in business lines highlight why a risk-based capital requirement alone is not\nsufficient. Many of the largest banking organizations are less reliant on deposits and more reliant on\nwholesale funding as a result of their large broker-dealer operations. For these organizations, the\nprimary risk issue is the riskiness of their funding model. As a result, using only credit-risk-based\nmeasures of capital may not capture the “true riskiness” of these organizations.\nGiven all this, I would argue that the leverage ratio is an important supplement to risk-based\ncapital requirements. While the leverage ratio is not designed to explicitly capture wholesale funding\nrisk, it in effect serves this purpose because of the higher weight it gives to low-risk assets – which are\nthe very assets that wholesale funding typically supports.\nIn sum, the business models of some bank holding companies span diverse activities,\nparticularly among the largest organizations. Broker-dealer operations carry high risk-weighted\ncapital ratios because they hold low-risk assets – but they are still highly leveraged.\n\nConcluding Observations\nBank holding companies have responded to more regulatory and supervisory scrutiny of\ncapital by raising their capital ratios. This should position banking organizations to have greater loss\nabsorption capacity, should it be necessary.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nHowever, along with the increased focus on capital regulation has come significantly more\ncomplexity. To the extent that this complexity makes it more difficult for investors and depositors to\ndistinguish the financial condition of bank holding companies, there is the potential that the\ncomplexity could weaken the third pillar of Basel III market discipline. Now that many of the\nregulations are being implemented, there should be thoughtful consideration as to whether\nstreamlining the rules could maintain the same level of capital adequacy assurance with lower cost to\nbanking organizations, regulators, and investors.\nSome of the complexity in bank capital regulation is unavoidable. Global banking\norganizations are in a variety of business activities, some of which take sophisticated modeling to\nassess the risk of the activity. However, potential ways to streamline capital regulation would be to\nplace greater emphasis on narrow capital definition, such as Tier 1 common equity – and to\naccelerated emphasis on Basel III.\nIn contrast, the complexity of business models may make it difficult to rely on only risk-based\ncapital requirements. The range of risks in business models – on both the asset side and the liability\nside of balance sheets – may make the funding model more risky than is captured by only using riskbased capital requirements. The leverage ratio is a particularly important supplemental tool for global\nbanking organizations that are heavily reliant on wholesale funding. For many of these firms, the\nbusiness model is less traditional than for smaller banks – and more at risk of experiencing funding\nproblems potentially requiring fire sales of assets.\nLarge broker-dealers in many large bank holding companies exemplify this risk. By funding\nsecurities portfolios with shorter term wholesale funding, their risks are not fully captured by relying\nonly on risk-based capital ratios. Large global banking organizations with large broker-dealers are\norganizations where leverage ratios and capital charges on wholesale funding are particularly\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 18, 2013 at 1:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 10:00 AM in Abu Dhabi – or Upon Delivery *\n\nappropriate. Currently, many of these very large organizations have lower leverage capital ratios than\nare observed at more traditional large bank lenders.\nLet me leave you with this view: global banks with significant investment banking and brokerdealer activities pose significant potential risk to the financial system and should be among the best\ncapitalized large banking organizations.\nThank you.\n\nNotes:\n1\n\nSee Tarullo, D. (2013, May), Evaluating Progress in Regulatory Reforms to Promote Financial Stability. Speech\npresented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C. See also Tarullo, D. (2013, September),\nMacroprudential Regulation. Speech presented at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial\nServices, New Haven, Connecticut. Both speeches can be found at http://www.federalreserve.gov.\n2\n\nThe analysis for this talk includes bank holding companies that are Y-9C filers.\n\n3\n\nThe Basel III rule augments both the general risk-based capital requirements (Basel 1) as well as the “advanced\napproaches” risk-based capital requirements (Basel 2), but both the general and advanced risk-based capital requirements\nremain in effect for advanced-approaches firms. As a result of the dual compliance requirement (i.e., the Collins\namendment), the more binding of the two regulatory capital requirements at any given point in time is the effective riskbased capital requirement.\n\n4\n\nTier 1 common equity is generally the most narrow definition of capital reported, and focuses on those elements of\ncapital best able to absorb losses. Tier 1 equity capital is less narrow and allows banks to include qualifying perpetual\npreferred stock, qualifying minority interests, and qualifying trust preferred securities. Total risk-based capital is an even\nbroader definition and includes qualifying subordinated debt, a portion of the loan loss allowance, and other Tier 2 capital\nelements.\n5\n\nThe final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in the U.S., approved on July 2, 2013, includes a\nminimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. For banking organizations using advanced approaches, there\nis an additional requirement, a supplementary leverage ratio – the ratio of tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure – of at\nleast 3%. On July 9, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency adopted the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Under this\nproposed rule, bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in assets or $10 trillion in assets under custody\n(covered BHCs) would also be required to maintain a tier 1 capital leverage buffer of at least 2 percent above the\nminimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3%, for a total of 5%. In addition, depository institutions of\ncovered BHCs would be required to meet a 6% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well capitalized.” See the\nJuly 2, 2013 Final Rule – BOG press release and The Federal Register, October 11, 2103, Vol. 78 ,No 198, p 62018, CFR\nParts 208, 217 and 225.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe University of Massachusetts Boston\nJohn W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy\nand Global Studies\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 4, 2013\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be here at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and to\nhave an opportunity to share my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. I\nwould like to thank Dean Ira Jackson and the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and\nGlobal Studies for hosting me today.\nIt has been quite a celebratory weekend in Boston, with both the World Series\nvictory parade on Saturday and the Patriots’ points-filled win on Sunday. Unfortunately,\nmy message today will be that while the economy has been gradually improving, it is not\nyet time to celebrate our economic performance.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\nSince the beginning of this year, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) totaling $85 billion per month. In\naddition, we have indicated our intention to keep short-term interest rates at their\nexceptionally low levels at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5\npercent and inflation and inflation expectations are well anchored. These two monetary\npolicy tools – asset purchases to push long-term rates lower, and guidance related to rates\nremaining low – have provided an accommodative monetary policy stance designed to\noffset some of the “headwinds” that have impeded a more rapid economic recovery.\nSince the beginning of this year the unemployment rate has declined from 7.9 to\n7.2 percent, interest-sensitive sectors such as housing and autos have continued to\nimprove, and inflation has stabilized at rates well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. This\nhas all occurred in the context of an economy wherein fiscal policy has been quite\nrestrictive, with higher income taxes as well as substantial reductions in real government\nspending. However you feel about the political economy of fiscal matters, government\nspending is a component of GDP, and tax policy obviously affects consumer spending.\nFrom a historical perspective, significant fiscal austerity such as we have seen recently is\nquite unusual at a time when the economy is trying to recover from a severe recession.\nWhile there have been some areas of improved economic performance,\nunfortunately the economy remains challenged. Unemployment is well above what\nanyone would consider a “full employment” rate, and inflation remains well below our 2\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npercent target. We should all be mindful that inflation can be too low – too close to\ndeflation. For example, deflation characterized troubled economies like Japan’s during\nits “Lost Decade.”\nOur hope is that the improvement in real GDP growth that many forecasters had\nexpected to be in progress by now will soon begin, and that the economy will grow fast\nenough to provide sustained improvement in labor markets along with inflation moving\ntowards the 2 percent inflation target.\nMonetary policy should, of course, respond to the actual state of the economy and\nincoming indicators, as well as the progress made to date – in other words, it should be\ndata dependent. But policy should also be forward-looking, taking into consideration\nhow long it is expected to take to return to full employment within a context of price\nstability.\nThat brings me to our current asset purchase program. As we see more\ncompelling evidence of a sustainable recovery making satisfactory progress toward full\nemployment, it may be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to gradually reduce the size of\nour large-scale asset purchase program. I would emphasize that when the Fed chooses to\ndo so, we will not be restraining the economy – in fact, we will still be adding stimulus to\nthe economy but in smaller increments than before.\nBy way of overview, today I will briefly review recent developments related to\nthe Federal Reserve’s monetary policies. I will highlight some areas of the economy\nwhere there has been progress, and other areas where we need to make more progress. I\nwill provide some sense of the likely time frame for returning to full employment, and\nprovide a few concluding observations.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Developments\nFigure 1 shows the Treasury yield curves (the market yields for an array of\nTreasury securities of various maturities) as of three dates this year. The first date is May\n1, before widespread discussion emerged about the Fed potentially reducing its purchases\nof long-term securities. As a benchmark, the 10-year rate at that time was 1.66 percent –\na quite low 10-year rate, by historical standards. Over the course of the summer, as the\nmarkets began to anticipate a higher probability of the Fed reducing the large-scale asset\npurchase program, the yield curve steepened significantly. Before the September FOMC\nmeeting, the 10-year rate was just below 3 percent – more than a 100 basis-point increase\nsince the beginning of May.\nThe steepness of the yield curve prior to the Fed’s September meeting was\nsomewhat surprising. Long-term rates rose quite appreciably – more than could be\nexplained by the heightened probability of a modest reduction in asset purchases, and\nmore than was desirable given the still-fragile economic recovery.\nAlso, since the Fed’s 6.5 percent unemployment “threshold” for maintaining very\nlow short-term rates had not changed, it was somewhat surprising how much the shorter\nterm rates moved in the marketplace. After all, reductions in the monthly rate of central\nbank purchases of long-term securities would not necessarily affect the length of time\nthat we would maintain very low short-term rates.\nThe third yield curve in Figure 1 is as of the end of October. The Fed had\nmaintained the pace of purchases at both the September and October FOMC meetings.\nAnd market participants had developed concerns over economic disruptions related to the\ndebt-ceiling debate and the partial shutdown of the federal government. The result, in\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsum, was some reduction of yields – with the 10-year rate now approximately 2.6\npercent.\nFigure 2 illustrates just how much market expectations changed around the\nSeptember FOMC meeting. Before the meeting, primary dealers participating in the\nsurvey placed an over 50 percent probability on the Fed reducing the scale of purchases\nof long-term Treasury and MBS securities at the September FOMC meeting, and a\ngreater than 90 percent probability on the first reduction in securities purchases occurring\nby the December FOMC meeting.\nWhen the survey was updated after the September FOMC meeting, but before the\ngovernment shut-down, there was a significant change. Now the probability of the first\nreduction in long-term securities purchases occurring at the December meeting was\nplaced at over 40 percent, with over a 40 percent probability placed on the first reduction\nnot occurring until next year.\nFinancial markets have been very focused on the timing of any reduction in asset\npurchases. Figure 3 shows the difference in the size of the central bank’s balance sheet\nunder two hypothetical approaches – reducing purchases beginning in December or\nbeginning in April. While the actual reduction decision (both the timing and speed of\nreductions) will need to consider the economic conditions prevailing at the time, and\nweigh the potential costs and benefits of different programs, the point of the figure is that\nstart dates differing by a quarter or two would generate only relatively small changes in\nthe overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. That is certainly one reason for being patient\n– waiting until evidence of a more sustainable recovery is more clear-cut – before\nbeginning any reduction in the size of the purchase program.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nFigure 4 shows the improvement in employment during this recovery relative to\nthe previous three. In the three earlier recoveries, employment returned to its previous\npeak within two years. While the two mildest recessions had relatively slower recoveries,\nthe deeper recession in 1981 had a steeper recovery. Unfortunately, the most recent\nrecession was deeper than the previous three, yet the recovery in employment has not\nbeen as rapid as in 1981. Despite the significant lapse of time since the trough of the\nrecession, we still have not reached the pre-recession peak in employment. The severity\nof the employment loss, and the significant headwinds facing the economy after the\nsevere financial crisis, are both important reasons why monetary policy has needed to\nremain quite accommodative.\nWhile there have been a variety of headwinds at play, one of the unusual features\nof this recovery has been the significant fiscal retrenchment. I am not here to comment\non fiscal policy, but to underline its effect on the economic situation that the Fed must\nrespond to. The CBO estimates that fiscal austerity measures have reduced 2013 GDP\ngrowth by 1.5 percentage points1 – a very significant headwind. Had the economy grown\nby 3.5 percent rather than 2 percent over the past year, job growth would almost surely\nhave been stronger, unemployment lower, and inflation closer to the two percent goal.\nAs a result, with the Federal Reserve focusing on achieving its mandates, absent some of\nthe fiscal headwinds there would be much less need for the current degree (and extended\nlength) of monetary policy accommodation.\nEven the direct effects of government employment reductions have been quite\nsubstantial. Figure 5 shows that, not including the employment peak resulting from the\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhiring of temporary census workers, government employment peaked at the end of the\nrecession and has been falling ever since – a cumulative loss of three-quarters of a\nmillion workers. This reflects very significant declines in employment by state and local\ngovernments, as well as in the federal government.\nFigure 6 shows that this is not the typical experience during an economic\nrecovery. All three of the previous recoveries were supported by additional government\nhiring, not by reductions in employees. In fact, the sharp recovery in total employment\nduring the 1982 recovery included a significant boost in government employment. As I\nmentioned earlier, there are obviously differing views on the politics of government\nspending and employment, but as a practical matter, fiscal austerity subtracts from\nemployment and from GDP. As the Federal Reserve pursues its Congressionallyassigned “dual mandate” for price stability and maximum sustainable employment, the\nsubstantial contractionary effects of fiscal retrenchment have to be taken into account –\njust as any other headwind has to be taken into account.\nIn particular, the tools of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases have\nbeen quite successful in keeping short- and long-term interest rates low, encouraging a\nrecovery in those sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates. For example,\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 show that residential investment and auto sales have been\nrecovering – and explain why, despite significant fiscal retrenchment, the economy has\nstill been able to average 2.2 percent growth since the start of the recovery in 2009.\nHowever, with short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound, monetary policy has not\nbeen able to fully offset the headwinds created by the financial crisis, fiscal retrenchment,\nand unusually weak economies among many trading partners.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 9 illustrates the combined effect of the weak and strong sectors on overall\nGDP during the recession and recovery. While the decline in real GDP was unusually\nlarge in this recession, real GDP has already exceeded its pre-recession peak (in contrast\nto the experience of employment).\nFigure 10 shows that this recovery has been slow, but slow growth appears to be\ncharacteristic of the last three recoveries as well. What has been more striking is that\nfiscal policy has become more restrictive, even though we have not seen the improvement\nthat one normally sees, over the past two years of the recovery.\n\nReturning to Full Employment\nFigure 11 illustrates the relationship between growth in the economy and how\nlong it is likely to take to return to full employment. My own estimate of the “full\nemployment level of unemployment” is a rate of 5.25 percent, although I would note that\nmy estimate is lower than some of my central bank colleagues, as illustrated by the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), which has a range for unemployment over the\nlonger run (in other words, unemployment levels consistent with optimal policy\noutcomes) of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.2\nThe relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate can be\nanalyzed using a modified Okun’s Law, which is an approximation of how much\nunemployment falls when the economy grows faster than its potential. While this\nrelationship is only an approximation of what might happen with a given GDP growth\nrate, it does provide some context for how long it would take to get to my estimate of full\nemployment, assuming different hypothetical rates of GDP growth.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe left-side bars provide the annual growth rate needed to reach my estimate of\nfull employment by the end of the indicated year. For example, if this relationship is\nabout right, to get to 5.25 percent unemployment by the end of 2016 would require an\naverage growth rate of 3.3 percent. With an assumed potential GDP growth rate of 2.1\npercent, we should recognize that a realized growth rate below 3 percent will result in a\nlong wait to reach my estimate of full employment. At a growth rate of 2.8 percent, we\ndo not attain 5.25 percent unemployment until the end of 2018. The right bars show that\ngrowth over the most recent recovery falls far short of the growth during the previous\nthree recoveries, and also well short of the growth needed to return to full employment\neven over the next five years.\nFigure 12 replaces the historical growth rates of real GDP during earlier\nrecoveries with the midpoint estimates of growth from the September Summary of\nEconomic Projections of the FOMC members. The SEP midpoint estimate of real GDP\ngrowth over the next three years is a little over 3 percent. Assuming the economy\nbehaves as estimated in the modified Okun’s Law, this would imply that we do not reach\nmy gauge of full employment until 2017.\nCertainly there are a number of important assumptions made in doing this\nanalysis, but it illustrates that unless the economy grows much faster than the 2.2 percent\nwe have experienced to date during the recovery, it will take quite some time to reach full\nemployment – and exact a heavy human toll.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nMonetary policy has been highly accommodative in order to mitigate the\nrestraining effects emanating from the financial crisis, fiscal restraint, and slow growth of\ntrading partners. Monetary policy has been able to partly but not fully offset these\nheadwinds, resulting in only a tepid recovery to date. Most private forecasts, and the SEP\nforecasts, expect growth to accelerate – but only modestly, to 3 percent as the effects of\nthese headwinds diminish. However, it is important to note that most of these forecasts\nsee us attaining these results only under the assumption of significant continued stimulus\nfrom monetary policy.\nLooking forward, on the plus side, firm and household balance sheets have\nimproved, recovery in stock and house prices have provided more capacity to resume\nconsumption patterns, the fiscal headwinds are expected to diminish somewhat, and some\nof our trading partners are showing signs of recovery. But a good portion of the gains in\nasset prices and in spending derive from the help that stimulative monetary policy has\nprovided. As a consequence, monetary policy is likely to need to remain accommodative\nfor some time so that we can achieve full employment within a reasonable forecast\nhorizon.\nEven when the Fed eventually removes some of its accommodation, such as\nlarge-scale asset purchases, we will in my view need to leave short-term interest rates at\ntheir very low levels until there is much more progress reaching full employment and the\n2 percent inflation target. Furthermore, the pace at which the Fed raises rates, when that\nbecomes appropriate, should be, in my view, quite gradual, unless the economy picks up\nmuch faster than is currently expected. Overall, monetary policy needs to continue to be\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 4, 2013 at 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndata driven and, of course, to be focused on meeting the Fed’s dual mandate – within an\nappropriate time frame.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you at UMass Boston.\n\n1\n\nSee Congressional Budget Office (2013), The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023\n(Washington: CBO, February), available at www.cbo.gov/publication/43907.

Peter McColough Series\non International Economics)\nNew York, New York\nOctober 11, 2013\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be invited to speak at the Council on Foreign\nRelations. Since my introductory remarks will focus on central bank communications, it\nis certainly appropriate that your format allows for plenty of time for questions and\ndiscussion. I would like to begin with a few opening comments, and summarize the two\nfigures you will find in your handout.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\nThe past several months have highlighted the communication challenges faced by\ncentral banks when short-term interest rates are close to zero – what we call the zero\nlower bound – and policy “tools” include communication about the sequence and nature\nof future actions. It is important to note that with any monetary policy action, the\nultimate impact is highly dependent on the reactions and expectations of a range of\neconomic actors – from financial market investors to firms making capital spending\ndecisions to households considering new purchases. Their decisions can either amplify\nor reduce the intended impact of policy. Given this dynamic, the ability to communicate\nclearly is crucial.\nUnfortunately, the communication challenges are not at all trivial. Combined\nwith the lack of historical precedent for many of the Fed’s recent monetary policy\nactions, these challenges make us realistic and humble about our ability to gauge the\nlikely impact of our communications at the zero lower bound.\nFigure 1 in your handout charts the movement of the 10-year Treasury bond since\nthe beginning of May, with the largest one-day movements shown in the table. The data\nover this roughly six-month period highlight that 10-year Treasury rates have been quite\nvolatile, and have tended to respond noticeably to monetary policy announcements and\nnew economic data – particularly data related to the monthly report on the employment\nsituation. That reflects, in part, prior communication about the Committee’s focus on the\nlabor market.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile long-term rates declined after the last FOMC announcement, they still\nremain about 100 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of May. Certainly\ncontributing to the rapid rise in long-term rates were announcements, speeches, and\ntestimony by Fed officials that indicated that if the economy were to improve as they\nexpected at that time, it might be appropriate to reduce the central bank’s monthly\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities sometime in the fall.\nThe reaction to the discussion of a possible reduction in Fed purchases appears to\nhave had an outsized impact on long-term rates. The recent market reactions provide a\nchallenge to the view, argued by some, that the purchase program has no impact – since\nasset prices seem so sensitive to announcements of even a potential, modest reduction in\npurchases sometime in the future.\nOf course, a monetary policy that affected only financial markets would have\nlittle chance of achieving the Fed’s Congressionally-mandated goals. In normal times,\nmonetary policy is transmitted largely through interest rates. Although we have used\nunusual policy tools, our efforts to lower interest rates are evident in consumer spending\nin the most interest-sensitive sectors, such as residential investment and auto sales.\nSo it would appear that recent monetary policy actions can have – and have had –\na meaningful impact on the economy. And the fact that the possibility of small future\nchanges in policy could elicit such large movements in market interest rates and asset\nprices emphasizes that while central bank communication can be a powerful tool, it has\nalso proven an imprecise and unpredictable instrument in terms of its impact on longterm rates.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHow should we think about using this powerful but hard-to-control tool? For me,\nthe primary objective of any communication should be to clarify how potential current\nand future actions are consistent with achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals\nof maximum employment and price stability within an acceptable period of time. In the\ncurrent situation, the national unemployment rate is at 7.3 percent (well above most\nestimates of full employment), and the personal consumption expenditures inflation rate\nis at 1.2 percent (well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent). As a result, forward-looking\npolicy needs to be focused on how we use the policy tools at our disposal to achieve the\ndual mandate in an acceptable time frame.\nThe economy is affected by a wide variety of events outside the control of\nmonetary authorities. The fiscal disruption over the past week or so is but one example\nof an event that was unlikely to have been fully incorporated in most forecasters’ baseline\noutlook – but nonetheless has the potential to affect how quickly we return to a path\nconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate.\nAs a result, the appropriate path for monetary policy needs to be flexible enough\nto respond to unexpected shocks, and alert to the evidence of their emergence in\nincoming data. Monetary policy should always be data-driven, and should respond if the\nlatest information suggests that the economy is likely to significantly diverge from the\nappropriate path.\nImportantly, though, no one data series is likely to fully capture the information\nthat policymakers need in order to make that determination. There are a large number of\nhigh-frequency macroeconomic data series on inflation, employment, and GDP, all of\nwhich provide nuanced signals about the direction of the economy. This means that\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\npolicymakers cannot focus solely on any one data series or data element, but instead need\nto base policy decisions on a fuller set of data.\nUnfortunately, this also generates a communication problem. Saying that we will\nrely on all available data series, and that we will respond to news in the data that suggests\nwe are off the desired path for the economy, probably provides less clarity and guidance\nthan much of our audience desires. The resulting, inevitable uncertainty in this datadriven, multi-pronged approach may increase variability in financial markets, as different\nmarket participants sift through and interpret both the data and the public\npronouncements by officials of the central bank.\nAt the other extreme would be a very transparent and clear communication stating\nthat we will change our policy on a particular calendar date. But a problem with dates is\nthat if the economy’s path diverges significantly from what is anticipated, a calendarbound policy may be inconsistent with achieving our goals in an appropriate timeframe.\nHaving very clear communication that “locks” policy into an inappropriate move would\nclearly be undesirable.\nAn intermediate case could tie communication about policy to an important\neconomic variable. As long as that variable is a good proxy for overall economic\nconditions, it has the benefit of being transparent and observable, and thus easily\ncommunicated. The potential downside emerges if the variable stops serving as an\naccurate proxy for overall economic conditions, in which case it could lead to a poor\npolicy decision in much the same way as a rigid calendar date.\nFor example, the unemployment rate is a widely-used summary measure of labor\nmarket conditions. But despite its popularity, the unemployment rate is not always the\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbest summary indicator. A decline in the unemployment rate resulting from firms hiring\nmore workers would certainly be welcome at this time. However, a decline in the\nunemployment rate resulting from discouraged workers leaving the labor force would be\nunwelcome and would provide a quite different signal about the state of the economy. So\ntying policy to a particular outcome for one economic variable may be observable and\ntransparent, and reduce the uncertainty around monetary policy action – but could also\nprovide the wrong signal and could lead to policies that actually move the economy in a\ndirection inconsistent with the choice a policymaker would make with more flexibility.\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that most investors seem to focus on\ncalendar dates, not economic outcomes. As a result, investors will naturally translate\nguidance tied to economic outcomes into calendar dates, and that means caveats about\nconditionality, data-driven policy, and responsiveness to incoming data are likely to\nreceive far less attention than the translated calendar dates.\nFigure 2 shows results from a survey of primary dealers conducted before the\nSeptember FOMC meeting.1 Many market participants thought that there was a\nreasonably high probability of a reduction in Fed asset purchases in September, but many\nalso saw a relatively high probability that the FOMC might wait until a later date to\nadjust policy. Whatever the decision, a significant number of participants in the survey\nwere positioned to be disappointed. This lack of unanimity was likely to generate\nconsternation among those caught in an unfavorable financial position once the decision\nwas announced.\nNo calendar date was specified, and it was clearly communicated that the\neconomy needed to progress as expected for policy to be modified – but again, those\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncaveats tended to get much less attention. We saw weaker economic data emerge\nbetween the June and September FOMC meetings, and a higher than anticipated jump in\nmarket interest rates, along with the risk in September of possible fiscal-policy\ndisruptions. Given those data and risks, in my view continuing the asset-purchase\nprogram was warranted, and fully consistent with seeking to return to full employment\nand 2 percent inflation within a reasonable timeframe.\nHowever, the experience of the past several months makes it clear that a datadriven policy that also considers the risks to our forecasts can be difficult to\ncommunicate, because the policy will necessarily change as we update our forecasts and\nrisk assessments in the face of new economic data. This was emphasized in the\nSeptember FOMC statement, which made clear that asset purchases are not on a preset\ncourse.\nWe have more learning to do on how best to communicate monetary policy\nduring uncertain and unprecedented times. However, the most important thing we at the\nFed can, and should, communicate is that the policies we are setting are consistent with\nour goals – our mandate – for maximum employment and price stability. Getting the\nappropriate balance between flexibly implementing those policies and trying to\ncommunicate clearly and transparently to the public and to financial markets is likely to\nremain a work in progress.\nThank you again for the opportunity to be here today and to offer these opening\nremarks. Now I would be happy to respond to questions.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, October 11, 2013 at 1:05 P.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n“The Economic Outlook and\nMonetary Policymaking”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce\nBurlington, Vermont\nOctober 2, 2013\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It is a pleasure to be back\nin Vermont, where every season is wonderful but fall can be spectacular. I hope that a\nstrong foliage season this year will provide further support to a Vermont economy that\nhas recovered more quickly than the rest of New England, and much faster than many\nother parts of the country.\nI would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Tom Torti, president of the\nLake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce, and Ernie Pomerleau, president of\nPomerleau Real Estate here in Burlington. Ernie serves on the Boston Fed’s New\nEngland Advisory Council. It is one of our advisory groups, and provides an important\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nlink to what is happening within businesses around New England. At council meetings,\nErnie draws on his strong connections in Vermont to provide very helpful insights on\ntrends in the state’s business activity and economy. Tom and the Boston Fed have\nworked together for a number of years, and he was instrumental in helping us recruit\nErnie to that Advisory Council. Ernie and Tom were kind enough to make sure this\nopportunity to speak with you today came to fruition, and for that too I am grateful.\nThe Federal Reserve’s policymaking has been much discussed of late, in\nparticular in the two weeks since the monetary policy committee (the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or FOMC) last met. There has been significant public discussion and\ndebate over the Fed decision to continue with the program of purchasing $85 billion a\nmonth in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. There has also been a good deal of\ncommentary on the messaging that occurred in the lead-up to the meeting.\nToday I would like to explain my perspective, as one committee member. In\nparticular, I would like to describe why I thought the incoming economic data did not\nshow the progress I had hoped and expected at the time of the June FOMC meeting,\nwhen the committee discussed a possible reduction in the rate of asset purchases\nsometime in the fall.\nAs always, I would point out that my remarks today convey my own views, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\nSeveral factors caused me to strongly and unequivocally support continuation of\nthe Fed’s asset purchase program at the last policy meeting:\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n\n\nfirst and foremost, the disappointing incoming economic data, which had\nreduced my own and most participants’ forecasts for gross domestic product\n(GDP) this year and next;\n\n\n\nthe possibility of disruptions in the nation’s fiscal policies that might provide a\nfurther potential slowdown in economic activity, going forward; and\n\n\n\nlong-term market rates that had already risen more than I thought was\nconsistent with interest-sensitive sectors providing needed support to the\neconomy’s continued recovery.\n\nAsset purchases, like all monetary policy actions of the central bank, should be\nrooted in and dependent on incoming data. Forecasts are of course imperfect – and have\ntended to be overly optimistic over the previous four years. As a result, I believe we need\nto see data that compellingly suggest that over the next three years we are indeed on a\npath to reach full employment and 2 percent inflation. Today, I would like to review with\nyou some of the data that, to my thinking, indicated that conditions were not yet strong\nenough to assume the economy is on that positive and appropriate path – the data that led\nme to believe it would have been premature to begin reducing the rate of Fed asset\npurchases.\nIt is also important to emphasize that a policy that is data dependent cannot\nalways be “signaled” clearly, in advance. The FOMC forecasts can be wrong – reality\ndoesn’t always live up to our forecasts. Had U.S. fiscal matters not been so problematic,\nand incoming data on real GDP and employment stronger, it may well have been\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nappropriate to take some action in September. Unfortunately, those were not the facts we\nfaced, before the meeting.\nI would add that interpreting the data is an important and nuanced matter. The\nFOMC is a committee, and different participants can and often do have different\nperspectives on the strength of the incoming data. Some of the indicators the committee\nmust weigh in preparation for policy meetings include data that provide only partial\ninformation on an aspect of the economy – so that their import only becomes clear once\nwe have the fuller context provided by other, related data. Also, importantly, assembling\na coherent picture of the overall economy is challenging even with complete data, and\ninvolves “art” as well as science.\nThat points to the value of the committee members gathering together to arrive at\npolicy decisions. I will say that listening to the way in which other members, with\ndifferent perspectives, interpret the same data helps me form a more robust sense of\nwhere the economy is going. All this means that our fundamental reliance on data in\npolicymaking may result at times in less signaling, before FOMC meetings, about small\nchanges in the purchase program.\nI would hope it goes without saying, but let me take a moment to stress the\nfollowing. As Chairman Bernanke suggested in his press conference,1 Fed actions are\nnot determined by Wall Street’s expectations of what we might or should do. Rather, our\npolicies need to be consistent with achieving key goals like supporting Main Street’s\nmore rapid return to full employment – and keeping away the extremely low inflation that\ncharacterized troubled economies like Japan’s in its “Lost Decade” and moving toward\nthe Fed’s two percent inflation objective.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nI do not mean to imply that the communications and signaling issues of the last\nfew months have not been difficult, for many. Without question, there are difficulties\ninherent in communicating a data-contingent policy – but a data-contingent policy is far\npreferable to the alternatives. The Federal Reserve will continue to refine its policyrelated communications, but I would just point out that predictive certainty will never be\nthe case when policy is rooted in actual incoming data, which may or may not follow\nforecasts.\n\nRecent Economic Data\nWith that as introduction, let me now turn to the recent economic data that helped\ninform decisions at the September FOMC meeting. Figure 1 shows the path of the\nunemployment rate over the past five years. From the beginning of 2008, when the\nunemployment rate was 5 percent, the rate kept climbing – past the end of the recession.\nIndeed, it peaked at 10 percent in October of 2009. One year ago, the August\nunemployment rate was 8.1 percent, and as of August of this year the rate had fallen to\n7.3 percent. Clearly the unemployment rate has been declining since its peak – albeit\nslowly – and there has been slow but steady progress in reducing the rate over the past\nyear.\nHowever, other employment indicators have not been so positive. Figure 2\nprovides the labor force participation rate – the percent of the population 16 years of age\nand over that is either working or actively searching for work – over the past five years.\nIt has declined gradually over this period, which may mean the unemployment rate in the\nprevious chart underestimates reality.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nLet me explain why. The decline in the labor force participation rate reflects two\nfactors. The first is longer-term trends in demographics, like baby-boomers reaching\nnormal retirement age and leaving the labor force. But most estimates suggest that\ndemographics alone cannot account for all the change we have observed in labor-force\nparticipation. Unfortunately, the second factor reflects current weakness in the demand\nfor workers, apart from demographic and other factors. Some workers who were looking\nfor work have become discouraged by the shortage of job offers – a shortage that has\nbeen persisting over an extended period of time.\nWere the economy to strengthen, some of these workers would likely return to the\nlabor force as demand for labor increased. If the demand for labor were strong enough\n— if the number of new job openings matched the number of workers returning to the\nlabor force — we could see increases in payroll employment with little change in the\nunemployment rate.\nUnfortunately, what sounds like a temporary decline in the labor force\nparticipation rate could turn into a permanent one. A significant concern is that the\nlonger we have such an elevated unemployment rate, the more likely it is that some of\nthose who have left the labor force due to the lack of jobs will simply never return. In\nthis way the decline in labor force participation could become permanent, implying an\nongoing loss of employment and income for those workers – a very serious matter for our\nfellow citizens and for our economy.\nFigure 3 shows payroll employment growth over the past five years. Over the\npast year, payroll employment has grown by an average of 184,000 jobs per month – and\nfor a few months we were averaging over 200,000 jobs a month. Unfortunately, that pace\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nof job growth has recently slowed down. Over the past three months, payroll\nemployment has averaged only 148,000 jobs per month, which coupled with only 2\npercent growth in real GDP suggests the economy is in a “holding pattern” – just treading\nwater rather than gearing up to make significant improvement in the still very elevated\nunemployment rate.\nReal GDP has grown by just over 2 percent on average since the beginning of the\nrecovery more than four years ago. Unfortunately, growth this year has shown no\nimprovement over that pace, with real GDP advancing a little less than 2 percent in the\nfirst half of this year. Most private forecasters are projecting that growth in real GDP in\nthe third quarter will be roughly 2 percent once again.\nThe bright spot in real GDP through much of the recovery has been the interestsensitive sectors. Figure 4 shows that residential investment has been strong – in fact it\nhas averaged just over 15 percent growth over the last four quarters. This strength\ncomes, in part, in response to the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program, which was\ndesigned to lower market rates and boost interest-sensitive economic activity. Similarly,\nauto sales have been quite strong – helped by unusually low auto-loan rates, which reflect\ncompetitive forces among auto lenders (including community banks) as well as the Fed’s\nasset-purchase program. In short, the most interest-sensitive sectors have been growing\nstrongly, in part because of highly accommodative monetary policy.\nDespite the resilience of the interest-sensitive sectors, the overall economy has\ngrown much more slowly than is the norm for economic recoveries. Obviously, it is very\nimportant to understand what accounts for this persistently slow growth. Figure 5 shows\nthat for the first half of this year some sectors, like exports, have grown faster than 2\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\npercent despite weakness among many foreign trading partners. This is partially due,\nagain, to low interest rates – low rates mean a lower value for the dollar in relation to\nother currencies, which makes U.S. exports relatively more affordable overseas.\nBut the figure highlights that the main drag on the economy has come from\ndeclines in government spending at the state and federal level, coupled with the tax\nincreases that depressed consumer spending earlier this year.2 However you feel about\nthe political economy of fiscal matters, government spending is a component of GDP,\nand tax policy obviously affects consumer spending. I would note that historically\nspeaking, significant fiscal austerity such as we have recently seen is quite unusual at a\ntime when the economy is trying to recover from a severe recession. Figure 6 shows the\ncontribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP – historically\npositive, on average, but usually negative in the current recovery.\nI would echo Chairman Bernanke and others who urge a return to long-run fiscal\nsustainability, while observing that excessive austerity in the near-term subdues an\nalready tepid recovery. I would note that fiscal headwinds can – and have – come in the\nform of lower spending as well as higher taxes. To underline the end result, Figure 7\nshows just how restrained employment growth has been in the current recovery versus\nprevious ones.\nMost private forecasts had assumed that in the second half of this year the less\ninterest-sensitive components of consumer spending would pick up, and the headwinds\ncreated by fiscal austerity would begin to ebb. However, Figure 8 shows that, to date,\nconsumer spending has not picked up as hoped. And while some of the effects of fiscal\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nausterity will eventually ebb, to date fiscal austerity is one reason we have yet to see\ngrowth much faster than 2 percent.\nUnfortunately, this remains an area of significant uncertainty, given debates in\nCongress on continuing resolutions and potentially allowing the country to default on its\ndebt. The uncertainties, not to mention the outcomes themselves, threaten to have a\ncollateral impact on the rest of the economy.\nFigure 9 shows the central tendency (which excludes the three highest and three\nlowest projections) for the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.3 Comparing the\nleft and right bars in each chart, the figure makes clear that FOMC participants reduced\ntheir estimates of growth in real GDP between the June and September FOMC meetings.\nWhile earlier the expectation was for real GDP to grow 2.3 to 2.6 percent in 2013, the\ncentral tendency is now 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013. Similarly, projections for 2014 are\nfor an improvement over 2013, but are now lower than was anticipated at the June\nmeeting.\nIn short, the data arriving since June have not ratified the earlier expectation that\nthe increase in real GDP would occur this year, and many of the FOMC participants are\nnow expecting that pick-up to occur instead in 2014, although by a more modest\nmagnitude. That pattern of expected strength eventually disappointed by tepid reality has\npersisted for several years now.\nAt the same time that the economy seems to have slowed, the inflation rate\nremains quite low, as shown in Figure 10. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures\n(PCE) inflation rate has been low for the entire recovery, and is currently at only 1.2\npercent over the past year. Similarly, total PCE inflation has been running consistently\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nbelow our 2 percent target – only breaching 2 percent temporarily, in response to higher\noil prices earlier in the recovery. Total PCE inflation over the past year has averaged\nonly 1.2 percent, and oil prices have recently been declining as the possibility of a\nmilitary strike on Syria subsided.\nReturning to the Committee’s forecasts, Figure 11 provides the midpoint of the\ncentral tendency of participants’ forecasts for PCE inflation and core PCE inflation.\nThese forecasts show only a very gradual increase in inflation for both the total and core\nmeasures. My own forecast is quite similar, with both total and core measures of\ninflation over the next several years falling below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nUnfortunately, most of the risks to the outlook remain on the downside. Concerns\nover untimely fiscal austerity here and abroad, and the possibility of problems once again\nemerging in parts of Europe, could cause the Federal Reserve to miss on both elements of\nits dual mandate – employment and inflation – through 2016.\nIn my view, the asset-purchase program should remain dependent on incoming\neconomic data, and we should seek to get the economy on a path to achieve both\nelements of the Fed’s dual mandate – employment and inflation – as soon as possible,\nhopefully by 2016. Should the economy speed up more rapidly than is sustainable, we\ncan remove accommodation more quickly. Should the economy unexpectedly slow\ndown, we can and should provide more accommodation than is currently anticipated. If\nthe economy evolves as expected, policy should in my view include only a very slow\nremoval of accommodation over the next several years – and that should only occur when\nthe data ratify our forecast for an improvement in real GDP and employment.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 2, 2013 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe last FOMC monetary policy statement made clear that we are not following a\npredetermined path for monetary policy. Unfortunately, the incoming data do not show\nthe economic improvement that we had hoped for in June, and still ultimately expect.\nIt is likely that for such improvement we will need to see the fiscal headwinds\nsubside, and also see consumers become more confident. This would be consistent with\nmost private-sector forecasts that still anticipate an improving economy.\nHowever, in my view if the economy is not improving as expected, we should not\nreduce the monetary policy accommodation. Doing so risks slowing the sectors of the\neconomy that have shown the greatest strength – the interest-sensitive sectors that have\nbeen most responsive to policy actions. That, in turn, will prolong this period of elevated\nunemployment and slow job growth, turning what has been a long – but we hope still\ntemporary – economic disruption into one with very long-lasting undesirable\nconsequences for U.S. households and businesses.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20130918.htm\n\n2\n\nObviously business investment is also a weak spot. While it is certainly interest-sensitive, it also may be\nimpacted by fiscal uncertainty, only modest GDP growth, and subdued growth in consumer spending\n(consumption).\n3\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20130918.pdf\n\n11\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConference on Stable Funding\nsponsored by\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nand the\nOffice of Financial Research\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 27, 2013\n\nI would like to thank the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the Office of\nFinancial Research for organizing this conference, and for inviting me to speak today. As\nyou all know, we recently passed the five-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman\nBrothers. This conference is particularly appropriate because many of the issues\nsurrounding stable funding, so relevant in the crisis, sadly remain with us today.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIndeed, one of the hallmarks of the 2008 financial crisis was the severity of runs\non financial intermediaries that were not traditional depository institutions. During these\nruns, the inability to obtain short-term funding meant that broker-dealers could not\nfinance their securities portfolios. Similarly, Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and\nother structured financial entities could not obtain rollover financing. And as you well\nknow, in the wake of the Lehman failure, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to\nmaintain a fixed net asset value (NAV). Investors who were concerned that other funds\nwith exposure to Lehman might not be able to maintain their NAVs ran from prime\nmoney market mutual funds (MMMFs).\nMany of the structural weaknesses that lie beneath these run episodes have yet to\nbe fully addressed by market participants and policymakers. It is good that they will be\ndiscussed in various sessions at today’s conference.\nGiven that our time is limited, I will focus my remarks on MMMFs and, given the\nconference themes, the critical role that MMMFs play in short-term credit markets,\nproviding funding to financial intermediaries. I will first describe how prime MMMFs\ncontributed critically to the financial instability experienced in the fall of 2008 –\ninstability that necessitated substantial government intervention, including providing\ninsurance for MMMFs, tailoring an emergency lending facility to provide liquidity for\nMMMFs, and providing a variety of other emergency liquidity facilities – in part as a\nresult of the “collateral damage” throughout the financial infrastructure stemming from\nthe run on MMMFs. I would stress that these actions were taken not to prop up the\nfinancial infrastructure per se, but rather to ensure funding flows that are crucial to real\neconomic activity.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSecond, I will describe some of the challenges posed by the structure of MMMFs,\nwhich necessitated the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) 2010 reforms to\nRule 2-a7 as well as the Commission’s current proposal on money market mutual fund\nreform. In this, I will draw heavily from the joint letter sent by all 12 of the Federal\nReserve Bank presidents in response to the SEC’s request for comment. I would like,\nhowever, to stress that while many of my comments will draw from that comment letter,\nmy remarks today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues\nat the Board of Governors, or the other Reserve Bank presidents who signed the letter.1\nThird, I will discuss what I see as some needed enhancements to the SEC\nproposal. I will conclude that the floating NAV proposal, properly implemented, would\nenhance financial stability; but the proposal to allow discretionary liquidity fees and\nredemption gates would not enhance financial stability – and would likely be worse than\nthe status quo.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Funds during the Crisis\nFigure 1 shows total MMMF assets under management, which currently total\napproximately $2.6 trillion. These assets are distributed across funds that buy short-term,\ntax-free municipal securities (approximately $265 billion in assets), funds that buy shortterm government and agency securities2 (approximately $890 billion in assets), and funds\nthat purchase short-term corporate and financial debt instruments as well as government\nand agency securities. The latter, the so-called “prime” money market mutual funds,\nrepresent about 56 percent of total MMMF assets (about $1.5 trillion).3\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAll three types of MMMFs hold short-term securities, as required by rule 2a-7\nunder the Investment Company Act. Specifically, the Act constrains MMMFs to hold\nsecurities with no more than 397 days to maturity and to maintain a weighted average\nmaturity of 60 days or less.4 The MMMFs, regulated by the SEC, are to have very\nlimited interest rate risk, a high degree of liquidity, and – ideally – relatively limited\ncredit risk.\nFigure 2 shows the assets under management for all MMMFs, and separately for\njust the prime money market funds. As you can see, MMMFs grew rapidly during the\nperiod leading up to the financial crisis, but experienced a significant outflow when the\nfailure of Lehman Brothers led the Reserve Primary Fund to “break the buck” (becoming\nunable to maintain a fixed $1 per share net asset value).\nAs it became apparent that some prime funds were exposed to non-trivial amounts\nof credit risk, and with investors in the Reserve Primary Fund unable to access their\nmoney and facing uncertain losses, investors in other prime MMMFs began to quickly\nredeem their funds. In the week after the Reserve Primary Fund announcement, more\nthan $300 billion dollars “ran” from prime funds. At least some of the funds redeemed\nfrom prime MMMFs were reinvested into government MMMFs, as investors sought\nfunds that did not take credit risk. Of course, others transferred deposits to insured\ndepository institutions.\nThe run on prime MMMFs would likely have been much more severe and\ndisruptive had the Treasury not announced a temporary guarantee program, which\nprovided insurance to money fund investors, and had the Federal Reserve not set up an\nemergency lending facility that provided needed liquidity to MMMFs experiencing (or\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nconcerned that they might soon experience) significant withdrawals.5 These\nunprecedented government actions were designed to provide confidence to investors to\nstem the outflows from prime funds. But they were also intended to stabilize the shortterm funding markets, because the dramatic reduction in money fund assets meant that\nmoney market funds withdrew from their role as significant purchasers of short-term debt\ninstruments – an activity critical to the functioning of short-term credit markets and the\nprovision of stable funding within the financial system.\nFigure 3, which shows the current composition of prime money market mutual\nfunds, highlights why these entities are so critical to the provision of stable funding.\nMMMFs continue to provide important liquidity for short-term debt instruments, such as\ncommercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and short-term debt obligations. As I\nhave suggested, one reason that short-term credit froze up in the wake of Lehman’s\nfailure was that money market funds were not able to continue purchasing such debt,\nwhich slowed the flow of critical stable funding within the “financial ecosystem.”\nThe result was that the Federal Reserve needed to provide liquidity not only to\nMMMFs directly, but also to markets where MMMFs were usually an important source\nof financing.6 By the way, it is worth noting that both the temporary guarantees provided\nby the Treasury and the type of liquidity facility run by the Federal Reserve are now\nessentially ruled out (by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and by Dodd-Frank\nprovisions). Thus, if MMMFs were to again experience a significant run, short-term\ncredit markets could not rely on the same degree of government support, and might find\nthe shock to stable funding to be even more disruptive.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSo where are we now? Currently we have new limitations on public-sector safety\nnets for MMMFs. We have the still-remaining risk of a significant disruption to shortterm credit markets, were MMMFs to again experience runs. As a result, there are\nreasons to remain concerned about credit risk some MMMFs may be taking.\nOne possible source of risk is highlighted in Figure 4, which shows the European\nexposure of MMMFs. Roughly one-third of the assets held by prime MMMFs are related\nto European firms. Of course, there are many European firms with low credit risk, but if\nsome MMMFs get more comfortable with riskier European exposures, the financial\nsystem becomes more susceptible to a financial shock emanating from Europe.\nFigure 5 shows the reduction in MMMFs’ exposure to commercial paper and\nasset-backed commercial paper since the financial crisis. The decline, in part, reflects the\nlow-interest-rate environment, which has led many firms to issue longer-term debt. It\nalso reflects the fact that many markets that relied on asset-backed financing still have not\nrecovered. However, money markets remain an important source of financing for these\ninstruments.\nIn summary, I would say that prime MMMFs remain a very important source of\nfinancing for short-term debt instruments – and thus any disruption in the MMMF sector\ncould again impede the provision of stable funding to financial intermediaries. Many of\nthe tools used to offset the 2008 run by MMMF investors have been ruled out by\nlegislation. And once again, some MMMFs are beginning to take riskier positions. Thus,\nthe financial stability concerns surrounding MMMFs remain real, five years after the\nfinancial crisis.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Reform\nReform remains critical because MMMFs implicitly promise to return a fixed net\nasset value, even as they take credit risks against which they hold no capital. A failure to\nkeep this implicit promise during a future period of financial turmoil could risk once\nagain freezing short-term credit markets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council\n(FSOC) has proposed three potential reforms,7 with the one requiring MMMFs to hold\ncapital quite similar to proposals currently being considered in Europe.8 However, at this\ntime the SEC has advanced only two proposals, only one of which was included in the\nFSOC proposals.\nThe first SEC proposal, which was suggested by the FSOC, would treat\ninstitutional prime MMMFs like other mutual funds and allow the value of a share of the\nfund to float with the value of its underlying assets. But unlike the FSOC’s proposal, the\nSEC’s proposal limits this reform option to institutional prime MMMFs (funds serving\ninstitutional investors).\nThe incentive to run on a MMMF stems from the concern that a fund could suffer\ncredit or other losses and would be unable to redeem shares at its “fixed” net asset value.\nIn that case, the first investors to ask for their funds back will get them, while later\ninvestors may not.\nThe floating NAV, which removes the implicit promise to redeem shares at a\nfixed net asset value, short-circuits this dynamic. Investors recognize that the market\nvalue of the fund’s assets can fluctuate modestly, even though they are of high quality\nand short maturity. As a consequence, the value of their shares in the fund will fluctuate\n– as they do with most other mutual funds – and what they receive upon redemption will\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\ndepend on the market prices of the fund’s assets at the time of redemption. Thus, with a\nfloating NAV, if the assets properly reflect market values, the incentive to run that stems\nfrom the possibility of “breaking the buck” under the current rules should be significantly\nreduced.\nThe second SEC proposal, which was not suggested by the FSOC, would require\nthe fund’s directors to impose a fee of not more than 2 percent on all redemptions in the\nevent that the fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below a specified threshold. The proposal,\nhowever, gives the fund’s directors discretion to impose a lower fee or no fee if they\ndetermine that such action is not in the best interest of the fund.9 This liquidity fee is\nintended to discourage investors from redeeming funds at a time when the MMMF is\nexperiencing significant withdrawals. Additionally, under the proposal the fund’s\ndirectors could, at their discretion, impose temporary “gates” to prevent redemptions for a\ntime. These temporary redemption gates would, the proposal envisions, prevent investors\nfrom redeeming funds – thus ending an investor run.\nAllow me to address the two proposals in reverse order. The reason for my strong\nopposition to the second proposal is that liquidity fees and gates fundamentally change\nthe investor’s decision-making process during a financial crisis in a way that increases\nthe potential for financial instability, and could be worse than no reform at all. The\nliquidity fee imposes a haircut on investors who are redeeming funds – a haircut that may\nnot be associated with the underlying value of the assets. Since MMMFs are often used\nas transaction accounts, this haircut would impose significant fees on investors that had\nviewed the account as a means of paying for transactions (and most MMMFs are\ncurrently paying less than 5 basis points a year to investors).\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn addition, the temporary redemption gates would restrict investors’ access to\ntheir funds. During a crisis, investors may find that they temporarily have no access to\ntheir funds – and financial crises are exactly the time that many investors most need\naccess to their liquid funds. And when some entities do not have access (or fear that their\ncounterparty will not have access), it can have domino effects throughout the financial\nsystem.\nIn short, liquidity fees and redemption gates fundamentally change the MMMF\nproduct during a crisis. As discussed above, these alterations would likely increase the\nincentive to run from a MMMF. But in addition, they increase the risk of “contagious”\nruns. Assume, for example, that a fund has no credit risk problems, but another fund in\nthe midst of a crisis announces that it is imposing fees and gates. Now the investor must\nconsider how other co-investors in the same fund will behave: If other investors run, the\ninvestor could be faced with gates and fees even though the underlying assets have\nexperienced no change in value.\nThe probability of a run is increased due to the high degree of concentration at\nmany prime funds. Of the five largest institutional prime MMMFs as of the end of June\n2013, three had at least two shareholders each with a 5 percent or greater stake in the\nfund. If redemptions by one or more of these large shareholders caused a fund to breach\nthe weekly liquid assets threshold, other investors in the fund might run for fear that a fee\nor gate may be forthcoming.\nUnder this proposal, prime MMMFs would still take credit risk, promise a fixed\nnet asset value, and hold no capital. What would change is that the MMMF itself could\nfundamentally change during a crisis, by possibly imposing redemption gates and\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nliquidity fees. So this proposed alternative might actually increase run risk, and pose\ngreater financial stability concerns than the status quo.10\nThe other SEC proposal treats prime institutional MMMFs like all other mutual\nfunds. As with other funds, investors redeem funds at the net value of the underlying\nassets at the time of redemption. With this reform, MMMFs would be very similar to\nshort-term bond mutual funds, but have more restrictions on liquidity and credit risk than\nthe typical short-term bond mutual fund.\nSome might worry about continuing to use MMMFs for their current purposes\n(institutional transactions accounts, short-term savings) with a floating NAV. But the\nactual movement in the values of the underlying assets during most periods is likely to be\nquite modest.\nI would note that a potential problem with this proposal is that the fund must\ndetermine appropriate values for money market instruments that often see little\nsecondary market trading. In practice, funds would continue to employ a variety of\nmodels and “matrix pricing” techniques to value their assets, and could also hold certain\nsecurities at amortized cost so long as the result reflects the securities’ fair value. Any\nmodel problems – or any inappropriate application of amortized cost accounting – would\ndegrade the effectiveness of this proposal. My preferred response would be for the SEC\nto continue its efforts to increase the transparency of fixed income markets, to further\nenhance price discovery, and to periodically examine MMMF assets – especially those\nexperiencing significant credit risk deterioration – to confirm that funds’ valuation\nprocesses are appropriate.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn short, in my view moving to a floating NAV and treating MMMFs like all\nother mutual funds – if valuation is appropriately addressed – would reduce the financial\nstability concerns around MMMFs.\n\nAdditional Considerations\nThe SEC proposal on a floating NAV only applies to institutional prime funds.\nThis raises two concerns. First, Figure 6 shows the support that MMMFs received during\nthe 2007 to 2010 period, by fund type. More than 30 of the retail prime money market\nfunds needed support during the crisis, only somewhat less than the number of non-retail\nprime funds that needed support.11\nAlso, more than 40 retail funds took advantage of the emergency liquidity facility\nadministered for the Federal Reserve System by the Boston Reserve Bank to support\nliquidity for MMMFs. So, while institutional prime funds experienced significant\ninvestor runs, in the absence of extensive support and a liquidity facility provided by the\nFederal Reserve, retail funds may have experienced more significant investor runs as\nwell.\nA second concern is that the retail exemption applies to funds with a daily\nshareholder redemption limit of $1 million or less. An institutional investor may choose\nto spread funds across retail MMMFs so as to get the fixed NAV while still maintaining\nthe ability to quickly redeem. This would not only thwart the intent of the exemption, but\nalso result in retail funds being much more susceptible to runs in the next crisis.\nWhile the severe runs occurred at institutional prime funds during the last\nfinancial crisis, there is no assurance that the next crisis will avoid retail funds. With no\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\ngovernment support and with some institutional investors in retail funds, retail funds may\nbe much more prone to runs than the SEC proposal presumes.\nAnother concern is that government funds are exempt from the floating NAV\nrequirement as long as at least 80 percent of their total assets are in cash or governmentrelated securities. As Figure 7 shows, the largest government funds hold nearly 100\npercent of their asset in cash or government-related securities.12 Government funds\nshould be government funds. Using an 80 percent threshold allows funds to create a\nprime/government fund hybrid that would receive fixed NAV treatment. In my view, it\nshould be clear that investors are investing in government funds, and I would recommend\nsetting a much higher threshold – consistent with current practices at many of the largest\nfunds.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would stress that MMMF reform is overdue.\nHowever, it is important that the reforms actually reduce the financial stability issues that\nremain under the current structure. Promising a fixed NAV with no capital while taking\ncredit risk is not sustainable – especially in potential future crises where the response of\nthe public sector will be substantially limited, compared to 2008. MMMF runs should\nnot be allowed to once again impede the flow of stable funding within our financial\nsystem.\nThe SEC proposal to allow funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates\nshould be dropped. This particular proposal is, in my view, worse than the status quo. It\nwould only increase the risk of financial instability.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nHowever, I strongly support requiring a floating NAV for all prime funds, both\ninstitutional and retail, which would treat these funds like other mutual funds. Investors\nwho want a fixed NAV can keep their funds in government-only funds – and those\nshould have the vast majority of their portfolios invested in cash and government\nsecurities.\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you on this key topic.\n\n1\n\nThe letter from all 12 Reserve Bank Presidents was sent on September 12 and can be found on the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston web site (http://www.bostonfed.org/news/press/2013/pr091213.htm) or on the\nSEC web site.\n2\n\nIncluding repurchase agreements collateralized by such instruments.\n\n3\n\nThese are iMoneyNet figures – weekly, as of September 3, 2013.\n\n4\n\nThis reflects the 2010 amendment to Rule 2a-7 that tightened the weighted average maturity limits and\nenacted liquidity requirements. See “Money Market Reform Final Rules”, Investment Company Act\nRelease No. IC-29132, May 2010.\n5\n\nThe Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) was\ndesigned to provide a market for asset-backed commercial paper to be sold by MMMFs. This facility was\nadministered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. For a full description and analysis of the program see\nBurcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick Parkinson, Eric Rosengren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul Willen, 2013,\n\"How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the AssetBacked Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\" in the Journal of Finance, vol.\n68(2), pages 715-737. The Temporary Guarantee Program (TGP) directly benefitted MMMFs by\nextending insurance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury. For details, see U.S. Department of\nTreasury, “Treasury Announces Temporary Guarantees Program for Money Market Funds,” September\n2008.\n6\n\nFor example, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was needed because of the inability of firms\nto roll over their commercial paper. The desire of MMMFs to shrink their assets was one reason why this\nprogram was needed.\n\n7\n\nThe FSOC proposed three reform alternatives: a floating NAV proposal, a risk-based capital buffer of 3\npercent, and a 1 percent minimum balance-at-risk proposal. See FSOC, “Proposed Recommendations\nRegarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform,” November 2012.\n8\n\nOn September 4, 2013, the European Commission released a proposed rule that would impose a 3 percent\nbuffer on money market funds that are fixed NAV funds.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, September 27, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n9\n\nTwo percent is referred to as the “default option.” However, the proposal notes that fund directors might\nchoose a lower fee if it is in the interest of the fund.\n\n10\n\nOthers have expressed concerns with fees and gates. For examples, see SEC comment letters from\nGoldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price, and Thrivent Financial.\n\n11\n\nSteffanie Brady, Ken Anadu, and Nathaniel Cooper provide a working paper that documents how\nextensive sponsor support for prime funds was during the crisis. See “The Stability of Prime Money\nMarket Mutual Funds Sponsor Support from 2007 to 2011,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, August\n2012.\n\n12\n\nUnder the SEC’s Investment Company Names rule, an MMMF may classify itself as a “government”\nfund if no less than 80 percent of its assets are in cash or government-related securities, including\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by such securities.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Economic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMay 29, 2013\n\nI would like to thank the Club for your invitation, and in particular Mark Olson, a\nformer member of the Fed’s Board of Governors.\nIt is a great pleasure to be back in Minneapolis. When I was in graduate school at\nthe University of Wisconsin at Madison, my brother was in graduate school at the\nUniversity of Minnesota – so I have fond memories of visiting the Guthrie Theater,\nenjoying the lakes, and seeing the passionate way a warm day is welcomed in this city.\nI am also grateful that you were looking for a speaker in May, and not January.\nMy comments today will focus on the progress the economy has made since the\nFederal Reserve adopted an open-ended large-scale asset purchase program last\nSeptember. I should mention as I always do that my comments reflect my views, not\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Fed’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nAt last September’s meeting of the FOMC, we took into account the August\nunemployment rate of 8.1 percent, and weighed concerns that without more policy\naccommodation the economy would make little progress in returning to full employment\nin the near term.\nSince adopting an asset purchase program focused on mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) last September, 1 and additional longer-term Treasury securities in December, 2\nthere has been some evidence of strengthening labor markets. The unemployment rate is\ncurrently 7.5 percent, and payroll employment growth has averaged more than 200,000\njobs per month over the past several months.\n\nI expect that the unemployment rate will\n\nbe down to 7.25 percent or a bit lower by the end of the year. This has been my forecast\nsince the beginning of the year, but the recent incoming data have bolstered my\nconfidence in that degree of improvement being achieved. In fact, I see it as a quite\npositive sign of underlying economic strength that labor markets are improving despite\nsignificant fiscal “headwinds” in the form of the payroll tax increase and the federal\nbudget sequester.\nWhat are the implications of these incremental changes in the economy for the\nFederal Reserve’s asset-purchase program? The program was designed to continue until\nthere was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, as long as the\nbenefits of the purchases outweighed the costs. My personal view is that the benefits of\nthis accommodative monetary policy program still significantly outweigh the costs.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile some improvement in labor markets has been achieved, it does not yet constitute\nprogress sufficient to merit halting the asset purchase program.\nAs for the costs, the Fed is and should be very attuned to unintended\nconsequences – and is intently monitoring an array of asset prices, including stock prices,\nhousing prices, and other widely held assets. At this point it seems that fundamentals are\nprevailing, and potential costs are well contained.\nI also believe that the Federal Reserve should make adjustments to the program\nbased on economic outcomes – that if the economy and the outlook improve, the rate of\npurchases could be gradually reduced, rather than suddenly stopped once we have\nachieved substantial improvement in labor markets. By the way, a reduction is one\npossibility, but of course adjustments could be down or up – because if the incoming\neconomic data do not reflect improvements consistent with both elements of our dual\nmandate, I believe the Fed should be willing to increase asset purchases.\n\nProgress in the Economic Outlook\nFigure 1 shows how the Blue-Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end\nof 2013, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters 3 projection for the same, have\nevolved since last September. As the actual, current unemployment rate has slowly\nreceded, there has been a gradual improvement in the forecast for the unemployment rate\nat the end of this year. Both forecasts are now projecting the unemployment rate will be\nlower at the end of the year than they had projected last September, although they are still\nnot quite as optimistic as my own forecast.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTurning to inflation measures, Figure 2 shows the evolution since last September\nof the Blue Chip forecast for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) at the end of 2013, and the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters projection for the Personal Consumption Expenditures\n(PCE) inflation rate at the end of 2013. Both show declining forecasts of inflation for\n2013, as incoming data consistently come in below forecasts – raising the possibility that\ninflation will fall further below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 4 We have\nbeen purchasing $85 billion in securities per month. Were we to decide to lower the\npurchase amount somewhat, our assets would continue to rise but at a more modest rate.\nThus we would be increasing monetary accommodation, but at a slower pace.\nOf course, many asset prices are calibrated to the anticipation of our cumulative\npurchases. Thus the effect of our purchases ultimately depends on whether they result in\na larger or smaller balance sheet for the central bank, which in turn depends on when the\npurchase program ends, given the pace of purchases. If asset purchases at a lower rate\nwere to continue for longer than they would otherwise, the Fed’s balance sheet could\nactually grow larger than it would with more sizable purchases over a shorter period. So,\nin short, altering the flow of purchases may or may not result in a smaller central bank\nbalance sheet, depending on how long the reduced inflow of assets continued.\nFigure 4 provides a scatter diagram that attempts to depict the economy’s\nexperience with inflation and unemployment, the two facets of the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate from Congress. Of course a variety of factors play a role in these outcomes, not\njust monetary policy – but it is instructive to look at the actual recent experience.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOn the horizontal or x axis I have plotted the PCE inflation rate minus 2 percent –\nso when the inflation rate is at our target, 2 percent, the dot should lie on the vertical or y\naxis. If inflation is above 2 percent it will be to the right of the vertical axis and if\ninflation rate is undershooting our target it will be to the left of the vertical axis. By the\nway, while the FOMC has only had an explicit 2 percent inflation target for the past 16\nmonths, there is strong empirical evidence suggesting that the central bank had an\nimplicit 2 percent inflation target over the past two decades. 5\nThe chart’s vertical or y axis focuses on the employment side of our mandate. It\nplots the deviation of the unemployment rate from the Congressional Budget Office’s\n(CBO’s) estimate of full employment. When the unemployment rate is above the full\nemployment level, the observations are above the horizontal or x-axis, and when the\nunemployment rate is below the full employment level the observations are below the\nhorizontal axis.\nIn short, a hypothetical “bull’s eye” outcome reflecting the dual mandate\nframework could show up as an inflation rate of 2 percent and an unemployment rate at\nthe CBO’s estimate of full employment – and such an observation would lie at the\nintersection of the two axes. Points that are near the intersection of the axes could be\nconsidered close to achieving both elements of the mandate.\nThe three red diamonds represent the most recent three quarters. They appear in\nthe upper left quadrant, where unemployment is well above the full employment level\nand inflation is below target. The red diamonds are well above the cluster of\nobservations representing quarters where performance was closer to mandate (closer to\nthe origin where the axes cross) – but at the same time are much closer to the origin than\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nat earlier stages of the recovery, when we experienced much higher unemployment rates\nthan we see currently.\nFigure 5 provides the same information as Figure 4, but uses the core PCE\nmeasure of inflation rather than the total PCE. With the core measure, the more volatile\nfood and energy prices that the Federal Reserve cares about but cannot control are\nexcluded. Clearly this measure of the inflation rate does not show as wide a range of\nobservations, in particular because it does not encompass the significant swings in oil\nprices that we have seen over the past two decades.\nThe chart clearly shows a dense set of observations near the origin and a\nsomewhat less dense set of observations above the three red diamonds. The chart implies\nthat we are transitioning from being well away from full employment, and have been\nmoving closer to the horizontal axis as the economy has recovered.\nFigure 6 shows total PCE inflation over a longer time period, the past three\ndecades. The solid horizontal line reflects the most recent observation of total PCE\ninflation. While there are three periods when total PCE inflation has been lower over the\npast 30 years, the current PCE inflation rate is much lower than it has been over most of\nthat period.\nFigure 7 shows the core PCE inflation over the past three decades, again with the\nmost recent observation reflected in a dark horizontal line. This shows even more starkly\njust how low the inflation rate is currently. The current core PCE inflation rate is close to\nthe low point for the past 30 years.\nSwitching from inflation to unemployment, Figure 8 shows the unemployment\nrate over the past three decades with a dark horizontal line at 7.5 percent unemployment,\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe current unemployment rate. While the unemployment rate has fallen significantly\nfrom its peak during this business cycle, it is still quite high. At an unemployment rate of\n7.5 percent, the rate is above the peak level in the last prior recession (2001) and near the\npeak level associated with the 1990 recession.\nThe charts highlight that while we have seen some improvement in labor markets,\nthe unemployment rate remains well above what can be considered full employment, and\nthe inflation rate remains well below target. In fact, core inflation remains at the very\nlow end of recent experience, and the unemployment rate is close to the cyclical peaks of\nthe past two recessions. And as I mentioned before, potential unintended costs of the\naccommodative policy are not currently evident. Taken together, these facts provide the\nrationale for my own view that, while we have seen some improvement in labor market\nconditions, significant accommodation remains appropriate at this time.\n\nDisaggregated Labor Market Data\nFigure 9 shows the pattern of unemployment by state – with dark green\nrepresenting states that have had a decline in the unemployment rate of 1.0 percent or\nmore since last September, light green representing states that have had a decline between\n0.5 and 1.0 percent, yellow representing states that have had a decline ranging from 0.0 to\n0.5 percent, and red representing states that have had an increase in the unemployment\nrate.\nThe overall improvement in unemployment rates has been widespread. Only five\nstates had higher unemployment rates in April 2013 than in September 2012, and one of\nthem is North Dakota – a state that has a very low unemployment rate of 3.3 percent.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSome of the states with the biggest declines in the unemployment rate have been among\nthose with very high rates, such as Nevada, Rhode Island, California, and Florida. Also\nnotable is the fact that states that were particularly troubled by falling real estate values\nand elevated foreclosure – such as California, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the\nstates with the largest declines in the unemployment rate.\nIt is also instructive to examine not just unemployment rates but the state patterns\nin payroll employment growth – since in some states the unemployment rate fell in part\nbecause of declines in the labor force, which could be the result of discouraged workers\ngiving up the search for a formal job. Figure 10 shows payroll employment growth by\nstate. Dark green states have had positive payroll employment growth that expanded\nfaster than the labor force. Light green states have had increases in payroll employment\nbut no increase in the labor force. Yellow states have had positive payroll employment\ngrowth, but the expansion has been slower than growth in the labor force. And the red\nstates have had declines in payroll employment.\nIt is encouraging that only three states have experienced declines in payroll\nemployment. Also, those states that were hit hardest by declines in real estate values –\nCalifornia, Florida, and Nevada – are all among the states that have experienced growth\nin payroll employment that exceeds growth in the labor force.\nTaken together, Figures 9 and 10 indicate that improvements in labor markets\nhave been relatively widespread, and that regions that were particularly impacted by real\nestate problems are among the states that have recovered the most since last September.\nOverall, this indicates that the economic recovery is beginning to positively impact most\nregions of the country.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, since last September there has been continued slow\nimprovement in labor markets. Most regions of the country now have better labor market\nconditions than they did last September. Despite the slowly improving labor market\noutlook, the unemployment rate remains at levels close to the peaks of the past two\nrecessions, indicating that the economy remains far from the full employment level.\nIn terms of monetary policy, it would in my view be premature to stop the Fed’s\nlarge-scale asset purchase program at this time. I believe the Fed should continue the\npurchase program until we see more sustained improvement in labor markets and have\ngreater confidence that the economic recovery is sufficiently self-sustaining to yield\ncontinued progress in reducing the still very high unemployment rate.\nHowever, I would also say that it may be undesirable to abruptly stop purchases,\nso it may make sense to consider a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases if we\nsee a few months more of gradual improvement in labor markets and improvement in the\noverall growth rate in the economy – consistent, by the way, with my forecast, which is\nsomewhat more optimistic than that of many private forecasters.\nI would reiterate that with an open-ended asset purchase program, changing the\nflow of purchases does not necessarily yield, in the end, a smaller central bank balance\nsheet. That would depend on having a fixed point for cessation of purchases, combined\nwith a lower flow of purchases. So, even if we were to adjust the rate of monthly\npurchases, the ultimate size of the Fed’s balance sheet would depend on the point of\ncessation. If economic growth proves sufficient and the purchase program was not\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNT IL 12:25 PM U.S. Central T ime (1:25 PM U.S. Eastern T ime)\non Wednesday, May 29, 2013, OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nextended over a longer time period, the size of the balance sheet could be smaller than\notherwise.\nThe bottom line is that we really need to see the economy grow, as I hope and\nexpect, more quickly than at the 2.1 percent growth rate it has averaged over the\nrecovery. Faster growth is essential to attaining inflation and employment outcomes\nconsistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – and more broadly\nfor the economic wellbeing of the many Americans who have struggled through a long\nand slow recovery.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee the September 13, 2012 FOMC statement available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\n\n2\n\nAfter our program to extend the average maturity of our holdings of Treasury securities was completed at\nthe end of 2012.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Global Interdependence Center\nCentral Banking Conference\nMilan, Italy\nMay 16, 2013\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to participate in the Global Interdependence Center’s\nconference on central banking. This continues to be a period requiring unusual policy actions – even\nexperimentation – at central banks around the world. So it is important to understand the forces\naffecting policymaking as well as the impact of the policies, both domestically and internationally.\nI always begin my talks by noting that these remarks reflect my views, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(the FOMC). That is always the case, but I want to emphasize it today given my topic – the\nimplications of fiscal austerity for monetary policy. This is a matter of great debate in most\ndeveloped economies, as governments contend with relatively high debt burdens – at least by recent\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nhistorical standards – as well as the after-effects of a deep recession, and a painfully slow recovery.\nCertainly fiscal matters are the subject of intense debate in the United States.\nOf course, much of the discussion – and many of the headlines – about fiscal austerity\nemanate from Europe. But, when we total up the cuts in state and local government spending and\nemployment, the cuts in federal government spending and employment, and recent tax policy, we\nactually see that U.S. fiscal policy has been quite contractionary for several years now – beginning\nwell before the recent payroll tax increase and the reductions in fiscal spending mandated by the\nfederal sequester.\nUnlike some of its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank has a dual mandate,\ncovering both inflation and employment. So it is important when pursuing our mandate and shaping\nour policy to consider all the factors that affect the economy. Fiscal policy is one such factor. For\ninstance, contractionary fiscal policy will in the near term place downward pressure on inflation and\nupward pressure on unemployment.\nCurrently the personal consumption expenditures or PCE inflation rate, which the Federal\nReserve chose as the measure for its inflation goal a year ago, is about 1.0 percent. This is well below\nour 2 percent target. And the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent, which while lower than many other\ncountries remains well above most estimates of U.S. “full employment.”\nIt is critically important that the United States achieve a balanced and sustainable framework\nfor government spending, but the timing is important. For example, making cuts too quickly to\nrestore balance to the federal budget deficit will have a dampening effect on near-term growth and the\nrecovery, and as such will push the economy further from a state that achieves both elements of the\nFed’s dual mandate.1\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, fiscal policy is just one of the many factors that the Federal\nReserve considers in policymaking, but one can see how the central bank – pursuing its dual mandate\n– would be likely to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance if government spending\nwere contracting in the midst of an economic recovery. Again, timing is key – long-term budget\nsustainability is vital, but decisions to front-load or back-load cuts in spending, or increases in taxes,\nhave implications for the current stance of monetary policy.\nOf course, some observers and indeed policymakers have criticized the degree of monetary\naccommodation in the United States as excessive. However, when we look at the data on outcomes in\nthe economy to date, I see it differently. The outcomes could lead one to argue that policy has not\nbeen sufficiently accommodative. Inflation is below target and unemployment is above target, and\nbased on the summary of economic projections (or “SEP”) – which is published by the Federal\nReserve and summarizes the economic forecasts of FOMC members – this condition is likely to\npersist for several more years.\nAt least part of this “miss” on inflation and employment outcomes can be attributed to the\nemergence of more fiscal restraint than might have been expected. You may recall that the federal\nsequester was originally designed to pose such an unpalatable outcome that all involved would prefer\nto reach an agreement on a more balanced fiscal approach. Unfortunately, that has not been the result.\nBy definition, the increased fiscal austerity in the U.S. has weakened the outlook for near-term GDP\ngrowth, since government spending is a component of GDP.\nTo be sure, the progress of the economic recovery to date has been frustrating. And, despite\nthe presence of significant headwinds – fiscal, financial, and otherwise – some have suggested that the\nslow recovery proves that recent monetary policy actions have been ineffective. However, contrary to\nwhat these observers claim, I would argue that the “miss” on outcomes is not evidence of monetary\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\npolicy ineffectiveness. In fact, in the sectors of the economy that are likely to be most responsive to\nlower interest rates, like housing and consumer durables, recent growth has been quite rapid.\nContrary to the notion that policy has not succeeded, I would actually say that monetary policy has\nbeen quite effective in offsetting the contractionary effects of recent fiscal policies.\n\nFiscal Policy and the Recovery\nAs everyone here probably knows, the overall growth rate of real U.S. GDP during this\nrecovery has been quite slow – averaging roughly 2 percent at an annual rate. Growth has also been\nslow relative to the growth that occurred during the most recent economic recoveries in the U.S.\nHowever, looking at overall GDP growth is only part of the story. Looking more closely at the\ncomponents of real GDP reveals differences, and provides more perspective on the U.S. economy’s\ntepid recovery.\nFigure 1 shows growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers. Essentially this is\njust the consumption and investment components of GDP (household and firm spending), net of\ninventory accumulation. It tries to capture the growth in domestic spending not attributed to\ngovernment spending or to the foreign sector.\nOver the past three years, real final sales to private domestic purchasers have been quite\nstrong, reflecting particular strength in consumer durables and residential investment2 – the most\ninterest-sensitive sectors. With household and firm spending relatively strong, other sectors of the\neconomy must account for the slow growth in overall GDP.\nFigure 2 adds real final sales to all domestic purchasers to Figure 1, so the difference between\nthe two lines is attributable to government spending. This measure has only been growing at a rate a\nlittle below 2 percent over the past three years. In short, while household and firm spending has been\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nrelatively robust, it has been offset by a fiscal headwind – reduced government spending – netting out\nto only tepid overall growth.\nFigure 3 shows the growth in government spending. Clearly, over the past three years the\ngrowth rate has been mostly negative, so real government spending has brought down the GDP total.\nThis is in contrast to the earlier period, during the recession, when government spending was actually\nan offset to the weakness in the private sector. During that period there was federal stimulus money,\nand federal funding for state and local governments designed to help them better “weather the storm.”\nFigure 4 shows another way to measure the impact of government spending on economic\ngrowth – the percent contribution of government spending to the percent change in real GDP.\nRecently, the increase in real GDP includes a sizable negative contribution from reductions in\ngovernment spending.\nFigure 5 splits government spending into the federal component, and the state and local\ncomponent. State and local spending has been weak over the entire recovery, although as the\neconomy has recovered and state and local governments have seen more tax revenue, it has become\nmuch less of a headwind than earlier in the recovery. On the other hand, federal spending has\nrecently fallen sharply and is likely to continue to be a source of weakness in the GDP accounts, given\nthe federal sequester.\nHistorically speaking, this pattern is unusual during economic recoveries. Figure 6 indexes\ngovernment spending at the trough of the recession to 100 for the current and previous three\nrecoveries. This recovery has been unusual in that government spending is not normally a significant\nsource of headwind as the economy recovers – in fact usually the opposite is true.\nConsider the 1982 recovery – the last time we had a recession where the unemployment rate\nreached 10 percent. Government spending by this stage of the recovery had increased by 20 percent,\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\none reason that particular recovery was strong. By contrast, during this recovery real government\nspending has declined by more than 5 percent over the 15 quarters of the recovery.\nFigure 7 shows total payroll employment and private payroll employment. The difference\nbetween the two reflects changes in government employment. During the recession, total payroll\nemployment was less negative than private payroll employment, indicating the government sector was\nnot shedding jobs at a time when the private sector was significantly downsizing. However, during\nthe recovery period, private sector payroll employment has grown more rapidly than the total,\nreflecting the loss of government jobs that has persisted over the recovery.\nIn sum, fiscal restraint during the recovery has been notable and naturally has factored into the\nrecovery’s pace. While the sectors that are sensitive to monetary policy have responded to the Fed’s\naccommodative policy actions, the results have not fully offset the headwinds, fiscal and otherwise,\nthat we have seen. The overall result has been economic growth around 2 percent, and only a very\ngradual improvement in labor markets.\n\nFiscal Restraint and Inflation\nThe unemployment rate is about 7.5 percent – at least 2 percentage points above my estimate\nof the U.S. “full employment” rate. Add to this the recent U.S. inflation experience and the other\nfactors I have been discussing, and it seems to me that highly accommodative monetary policy is\ncurrently appropriate.\nDespite concerns expressed by some that increases in the Federal Reserve balance sheet may\nbe inflationary in the near term, the inflation rate remains well below target nearly five years after our\nbalance sheet expanded significantly. Make no mistake, in many situations such balance sheet\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nactivity would be inflationary, but the fact that it has not been underlines how challenging the recent\nfinancial crisis, recession, and slow recovery have been.\nFigure 8 provides total and core PCE inflation. Core PCE inflation has remained below 2\npercent since December 2008 and currently is only 1.1 percent, close to the low for the last five years.\nTotal PCE inflation is slightly below 1 percent, at 0.97 percent.\nIndeed, the level to which the inflation rate has fallen would actually be of some concern in\nthe event that the economy was hit by a negative shock. Such a situation might echo the historical\nexperience of Japan, where low rates of inflation were not addressed and a significant negative shock\ncaused Japan to experience deflation, which has been quite difficult to reverse. In the U.S. there is no\nevidence that inflation expectations have fallen, despite the actual experience of persistently\nundershooting the Fed’s 2 percent target. However, remaining at such a low rate of inflation rate does\nincrease the risk that a negative shock could alter the stable inflation expectations that we have\nexperienced.\nFigure 9 shows one reason why this is a concern. It plots the real interest rate as the difference\nbetween the 3-month Treasury rate and the year-over-year core PCE inflation rate. In effect, this\nassumes that inflation expectations equal the past year’s core PCE inflation rate. Since the 3-month\nTreasury rate has remained very close to zero for more than four years, the movements in the real rate\nmust primarily reflect changes in the other part of the equation – the inflation rate. Importantly, as the\ninflation rate falls, the real interest rate rises. Higher real interest rates make it more expensive to\nborrow, after controlling for changes in inflation. Japan has been an extreme example of this\ndynamic, given that deflation has caused the real interest rate to remain positive despite a weak\neconomy and falling prices.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nIn sum, the longer we in the U.S. remain so far below our 2 percent target, the greater the risk\nthat inflation expectations could fall and real interest rates rise. In part to offset this risk, the Fed has\nconducted large-scale asset purchases that increase its balance sheet.\n\nBalance Sheet Implications\nFigure 10 shows central bank assets in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Euro area.\nEach central bank has expanded its balance sheet, with the U.K. and the U.S. being particularly active.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has seen a renewed increase in the size of its balance sheet, starting\nin the fall of last year, reflecting the new program of open-ended asset purchases. This latest program\nhas helped keep prevailing interest rates low, so that housing and consumer durables can continue to\nsupport the expansion and so we make further progress on both elements of the Fed’s dual mandate\n(inflation and employment).\nWe have seen a gradual improvement in labor markets, in part as a result of these actions. The\nunemployment rate was 7.8 percent in September when we began the program, and is currently 7.5\npercent. Employment growth averaged about 150,000 jobs per month in the three months ending in\nSeptember; then for the most recent three months (February through April) employment growth\naveraged over 200,000 jobs per month. But despite modest increases in employment in recent\nmonths, the employment-to-population ratio remains low.\nThis last observation carries the more ominous implication that, while there has been\nimprovement in labor markets, much of the improvement in the unemployment rate is just a result of\nworkers leaving the labor force. More significant improvement in the employment picture will\nrequire growth in real GDP that is faster than the 2 percent we have been averaging.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nAs I noted earlier, restrictive fiscal policy has had an impact on near-term economic growth\nduring the recovery. As Figure 11 shows, cuts in real government spending in the United States over\nthe past three years have been quite large. In fact, the cuts in government spending in the United\nStates have been much larger in percentage terms than in the U.K. or the Euro area, where fiscal\nausterity has received more attention. Fiscal restraint is one of the headwinds that we factored into\nmonetary policymaking, framed of course by our mandates from Congress.\nWhile Figure 11 considers only government spending, Figure 12 presents a broader measure\nof fiscal austerity, by including the revenue side and adjusting for the business cycle. The chart\nshows the impact of changes in taxes as well as government spending, after controlling for economic\ngrowth (removing the impact of the business cycle). Looking at the change in the general\ngovernment structural budget balance3 relative to potential GDP over the period 2010 to 2013, the\ndegree of fiscal austerity is fairly similar across the U.S., U.K., and Euro area.\nGiven the additional restraint imposed by the federal sequester, the United States is likely to\nonce again be a leader in cutting government spending. The Federal Reserve should, and will,\ncontinue to consider the likely state of fiscal policy, like many other economic factors, in making\nmonetary policy.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve. Labor markets have also slowly\nimproved. The progress has been in part the result of the accommodative monetary policy. While\nhousehold and firm spending has grown relatively rapidly, it has been partially offset by headwinds\nincluding cuts in government spending – resulting in only modest overall economic growth.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, May 16, 2013 at 7:45 AM U.S. Eastern Time and 1:45 PM in Milan, Italy – or Upon Delivery\n\nLet me close by reiterating that a long-term sustainable solution for fiscal balance is absolutely\nin the country’s interest. But timing is an issue. We have suffered a severe financial crisis, a deep\nrecession, and a painfully slow recovery. Fiscal policy is obviously the jurisdiction of the legislative\nand executive branches of government, but given the economic realities I would urge policymakers to\nconsider scenarios where some elements of fiscal rebalancing take effect only after the economy has\nmore fully improved, and the possibility of a less restrictive fiscal stance until that time.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSome would observe that much of the current federal budget deficit is cyclical, not structural – that simply moving to full\nemployment would eliminate a significant share of the budget deficit.\n2\n\nResidential investment has grown strongly over the last six quarters; prior to that its performance was more mixed.\n\n3\n\nThe structural budget balance refers to the general government cyclically adjusted balance adjusted for nonstructural\nelements beyond the economic cycle. These include temporary financial sector and asset price movements as well as oneoff, or temporary, revenue or expenditure items. The cyclically adjusted balance is the fiscal balance adjusted for the\neffects of the economic cycle; see, for example, A. Fedelino. A. Ivanova and M. Horton “Computing Cyclically Adjusted\nBalances and Automatic Stabilizers” IMF Technical Guidance Note No. 5,\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/tnm/2009/tnm0905.pdf.\n\n11\n\n\f",

Minsky Conference\non the State of the U.S. and World Economies\nThe Levy Economics Institute of Bard College\nand the Ford Foundation\nNew York, New York\nApril 17, 2013\n\nI am grateful to the Levy Institute for the invitation to take part in a conference\nthat focuses on such a vital goal – building a financial infrastructure that supports a more\nstable and equitable economy.\nBefore I begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that I join you from a\ncommunity in Boston that on Monday endured a terrible and profoundly cruel tragedy, at\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe Marathon. My thoughts are with the many people who were wounded, with those –\nincluding Boston Fed staff – who were uninjured but at the scene, and most of all with\nthe families and friends of those whose lives were lost.\nSo with heavy hearts we turn to the matter at hand, perhaps finding a small bit of\nencouragement in doing work that intends to make things better for all participants in our\neconomy.\nToday I would like to discuss the risk of financial runs – and the implications for\nthe stability of the financial system, which underlies a well-functioning economy. Of\ncourse, I would like to note that the policy views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (the FOMC).\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath have significantly increased the\nattention policymakers devote to financial stability issues. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) and a variety of new bank\nregulatory initiatives, including the Basel III capital accord, are intended to reduce the\nrisk of similar problems in the future. For commercial banks, the policy changes\nstemming from the crisis have been increases in bank capital, stress tests to ensure capital\nis sufficient to weather serious problems, increased attention to liquidity, and new\nmeasures intended to improve the resolution of large systemically important commercial\nbanks.\nWhile these measures are clear steps toward improved financial stability, I believe\nthe actions taken around other, less traditional financial institutions have not moved\nnearly as markedly or at the same pace as the corrective actions taken for commercial\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbanks. This is despite the fact that less traditional financial institutions were at the\nepicenter of the crisis. My comments today will focus on one area that has received less\nattention in the United States than elsewhere – the need to ensure that large brokerdealers will not need to rely on a government safety net in the future.\nThe financial runs that beset highly leveraged institutions, structures, and products\nwere significant and unfortunate features of the financial crisis. While deposit insurance\nreduces the risk that depositors will flee en masse from commercial banks, the financial\ncrisis highlighted that other types of financial institutions and structures were also highly\nsusceptible to runs. For example, money market mutual funds, which are not required to\nhold capital, experienced credit losses and significant investor flight (i.e., runs) during the\ncrisis. Policymakers put in place temporary backstops – insurance funded by the U.S.\nTreasury and a liquidity facility facilitated by the Federal Reserve – to avoid further\ncollateral damage. Since then, there has been much public discussion of regulatory\nactions that could significantly reduce the financial stability concerns around money\nmarket mutual funds – which are regulated by the SEC – but industry opposition has been\nvocal, and no significant actions have as yet been taken.1 Former SEC Chair Schapiro\nwas right to pursue money market fund reform, and now that her successor is confirmed I\nam hopeful that the SEC will revisit this issue.\nStructured investment vehicles (SIVs), which financed long-term, risky financial\nassets with short-term commercial paper, also encountered trouble during the crisis.\nInvestors who were concerned about the valuation of the SIVs’ long-term assets “ran”\nfrom the short-term commercial paper the SIVs issued to finance their assets, causing\nmany SIVs to fail or be wound down.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAdditionally, broker-dealer firms – which were assumed by most observers to\npresent less risk of a run because their borrowing is often fully collateralized – proved\nvulnerable and also played a prominent role during the crisis. However, widespread\nquestions about the appropriate valuation of collateral during the crisis made it apparent\nthat collateral in and of itself was not sufficient to avoid runs.\nBrokers act as agents for others and are defined by the Securities and Exchange\nAct to include those that “engage in the business of effecting transactions in securities for\nthe account of others.”2 Dealers are “engaged in the business of buying and selling\nsecurities for their own account.” Both are regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) and are subject to a variety of regulations including net capital\nrequirements, restrictions on the use of customer accounts, and various accounting and\nreporting requirements.\nBroker-dealers are a critical component of our financial infrastructure. They act\nas “market-makers” in securities, ensuring that markets remain highly liquid and that\nfinancial transactions can be conducted efficiently and effectively. Still, notwithstanding\ntheir market making strengths and capabilities, these organizations were not immune\nfrom the widespread seizing up of markets – and indeed found themselves at the center of\nevents in the financial crisis.\nTwo prominent broker dealers failed at critical junctures during the crisis. The\nfirst major broker-dealer failure involved Bear Stearns. Arguably the most disruptive\nfailure was Lehman Brothers. Emergency loans were provided to Bear Stearns, and in\nthe wake of its assisted merger a variety of emergency credit facilities to backstop the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nindustry were set up. Additional actions were taken, to forestall more widespread runs\nafter the failure of Lehman Brothers.\nDespite the central role that broker-dealers played in exacerbating the crisis, too\nlittle has changed to avoid a repeat of the problem, I am sorry to say. In short, I firmly\nbelieve that a reexamination of the solvency risks of large broker-dealers is warranted.3\nHence, my remarks today will highlight the need for more regulatory focus on\nbroker-dealers. I will begin by discussing the role of broker-dealers and their experience\nduring the financial crisis. I would then like to detail some of the policy actions taken\nduring the crisis – actions that backstopped broker-dealers and prevented further\ncollateral damage. Then I will examine why being housed within a bank holding\ncompany should not obviate the need for the broker-dealer subsidiary to hold more\ncapital. Then I will provide some concluding observations.\n\nBroker-Dealers and the Financial Crisis\nSome of the largest broker-dealers serve as a counterparty to the Federal Reserve\nwhen the Fed buys and sells securities – performs so-called “open market operations” –\nin the conduct of monetary policy. Traditionally, most of the Fed’s open market\noperations involve the buying and selling of Treasury securities, so broker-dealers that\nare the largest players in this critical market play a significant role in maintaining\nliquidity and market functioning. Most of these firms are also very active in making\nmarkets in a variety of other financial instruments, and as such they help to facilitate\nwell-functioning credit markets more generally.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 1 describes 10 large broker-dealers in 2006, with the fourth column noting\ntheir crisis-era changes. Rather striking changes have occurred among the largest brokerdealers as a result of the financial crisis. Two of the largest became bank holding\ncompanies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns –\nformerly ranking among the ten largest – both failed. Merrill Lynch, which fell just short\nof the top 10 in 2006, was acquired while it was experiencing financial difficulties. And\none of the largest foreign broker-dealers in 2006 (UBS) needed to be supported by its\nhome government. These outcomes occurred despite two substantial emergency lending\nprograms that provided backstop support to the large broker-dealers during the crisis.\nDramatic changes in organization and ownership occurred among these critical\nentities. That, and the extent of their problems during the financial crisis, make it clear\nthat they did not hold sufficient capital to weather the magnitude of problems they would\nface during the crisis.\n\nLiquidity Facilities during the Crisis\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n(PDCF) to help stem the financial crisis by providing overnight loans to primary dealers.\nThe assets that were put up as collateral for the loans were subject to significant\n“haircuts” – that is, the dealers could only borrow against a fraction of assessed market\nvalue – to protect the Fed and minimize the risk that could stem from a borrower’s\ndefault. As with the Fed’s so-called Discount Window lending to commercial banks,\nlending was at the Fed’s primary credit rate and the dealer was fully responsible for the\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrepayment of the loan, beyond the collateral pledged (in other words, the loans were\nmade with recourse).\nThe program began in March 2008, in the wake of the Bear Stearns failure, and\nended in February 2010.4 The PDCF was, in effect, tantamount to the Fed providing a\n“Discount Window” type lending facility to primary dealers – in order to ensure adequate\nfunctioning in securities markets that are a key part of the tri-party repo market.5 These\nmarkets are widely-used in short-term financing, and importantly are used by the central\nbank to conduct the trades in short-term government securities that allow it to maintain\nthe federal funds rate at the level dictated by the FOMC. It is important to point out that\nwhen all was said and done, all the loans made through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility\nwere paid off in full; and the sizable returns to the Fed generated by the program were\nremitted to the U.S. Treasury.\nAs Figure 2 highlights, primary dealers used the program extensively during the\ncrisis. Lending peaked at $156 billion.6 And, while foreign-owned primary dealers did\nparticipate in the program, it was much more extensively utilized by domestic primary\ndealers.\nThe Fed established a second emergency program, the Term Securities Lending\nFacility (TSLF), which allowed primary dealers to lend less-liquid securities to the\nFederal Reserve for one month, for a fee, in exchange for highly liquid Treasury\nsecurities. This program provided needed liquidity to the market at a time when trading\nin a wide variety of securities had become impaired. The TSLF was also announced in\nMarch 2008 and ended in February 2010. As with the PDCF, there were no losses on the\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprogram, and the revenue the Federal Reserve generated in operating the facility was\nreturned to the Treasury.\nFigure 2 also shows that the peak balance of the term securities lending program\nwas $246 billion.7 This program had roughly equal participation by domestic and foreign\nprimary dealers.\nFigure 3 shows the loans outstanding over time with the PDCF. The outstanding\nloans peaked in the fall of 2008 as primary dealers found it particularly difficult to fund\ntheir positions.\nFigure 4 provides the outstanding securities lent through the TSLF. Again the\npeak occurs in the fall of 2008, when liquidity for securities trading became particularly\nproblematic.\nIn sum, broker-dealers experienced dramatic difficulties during the 2008 crisis,\nand the Federal Reserve needed to temporarily backstop broker-dealers with substantial\nlending. Given that recent history, the assumption that collateralized lenders like brokerdealers are not susceptible to runs has been proven wrong.\nAt the same time, broker-dealer capital regulation by the SEC remains largely\nunchanged, despite the lessons of the financial crisis. Consequently, broker-dealers\nremain vulnerable to losing the confidence of funders and counterparties should the world\neconomy again experience a significant financial crisis.\nAs I have mentioned in other speeches,8 during stress periods, bank holding\ncompanies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price\nresponse to the stress periods than institutions with greater concentration in broker-dealer\nactivities. We have also examined the data on credit default swap spreads – a market\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngauge of the cost to insure against a party’s default – and the data show materially higher\nspreads during times of financial turmoil for major banks with higher concentrations of\nbroker-dealer activity.\nMoreover, the current broker-dealer situation vis-à-vis capital poses the potential\nfor significant moral hazard. Were a crisis to once again cause serious problems in\nliquidity and in securities-market functioning, it is quite possible that programs such as\nthe PDCF and TSLF would need to be considered again (notwithstanding likely public\nopposition to what could be perceived as “bailouts”). If broker-dealers assume that they\nwill once again have access to such government support should markets be disrupted,\nthey will have little incentive to take the steps necessary to shield themselves from\nfinancing problems during a crisis and thus minimize their need for a government\nbackstop.\n\nBroker-Dealers and Bank Holding Companies\nOne of the fallouts of the financial crisis is that many of the large broker-dealer\noperations are now part of bank holding company structures. Goldman Sachs and\nMorgan Stanley became bank holding companies during the crisis. Bear Stearns was\nacquired by J.P. Morgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.\nWhile these large broker-dealer operations are in bank holding companies, there are\nsignificant regulatory requirements and restrictions that apply, including capital\nthresholds and limitations on transactions between the FDIC-insured depository\nsubsidiaries and the affiliated broker-dealer subsidiaries. Despite these restrictions,\nhowever, broker-dealers can still pose a risk to the broader organization by leaning on the\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nparent bank holding company for support and, accordingly, reducing the availability of\nfunds at the parent company to support any FDIC-insured depositary.\nBank holding company capital requirements are applied to the consolidated\nholding company. Arguably, the appropriate level of consolidated capital should depend\non the risks inherent in the holding company’s liability structure, as well as in its assets.\nFor example, to avoid solvency risk for a firm dependent on wholesale funding may\nrequire significantly more capital than a firm with all insured deposits, because of the\npossibility for runs and “fire sale” disposal of assets. Those bank holding companies that\nare primarily funded by insured deposits are unlikely (or less likely) to suffer a\nsubstantial run. However, a bank holding company may find that liabilities of the broker\ndealer may be more susceptible to runs. In addition, current regulations restrict bank\nsubsidiaries from supporting non-depository subsidiaries with funds from the insured\ndepository. This suggests to me that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer\naffiliates should hold more capital to reflect the reduced stability of their liabilities during\ntimes of stress.\nFigure 5 shows the Tier 1 common equity capital ratio over time, and Figure 6\nshows the leverage ratio over time. While bank holding companies with large brokerdealer operations generally have more Tier 1 common equity than bank holding\ncompanies with little or no broker-dealer activity, this result primarily reflects that\nbroker-dealers hold securities, which have low risk-weights compared to loans. In\ncontrast, bank holding companies with large broker-dealer operations tend to have much\nlower leverage ratios than bank holding companies with limited broker-dealer activity.\nHowever, given the very different risks of runs posed by broker-dealers and their less\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nstable liability structure, an argument can be made for higher capital requirements for\nbroker-dealers as well as organizations, such as bank holding companies, with significant\nbroker-dealer operations.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would just reiterate that broker-dealers did not\nperform well during the financial crisis. Many of the largest broker-dealers failed or\nwere converted to or subsumed into bank holding companies. Despite these structural\nchanges, significant government intervention was required to maintain market\nfunctioning and liquidity, in markets key to the stability of the U.S. financial system and\nthe economy that relies on it.\nUnfortunately, despite this history of failure and substantial government support,\nlittle has changed in the solvency requirements of broker-dealers. The status quo\nrepresents an ongoing and significant financial stability risk. In my view, then,\nconsideration should be given to whether broker-dealers should be required to hold\nsignificantly more capital than depository institutions, which have deposit insurance and\npre-ordained access to the central bank’s Discount Window.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nRecently the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted a joint comment letter responding to\nthe Financial Stability Oversight Council's proposal on money market mutual fund (MMF) reform,\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/news/press/2013/pr021213-letter.pdf. “Money market mutual funds\nhave no explicit capacity to absorb losses in the event of a decrease in the value of assets held within the\nfund’s portfolio,” said the Reserve Bank presidents in their joint letter. “This structure gives rise to a risk\nof destabilizing money market mutual fund runs by creating a first mover advantage.”\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday April 17, 2013 at 1:00 P.M.

The Act generally defines a \"broker\" broadly as any person engaged in the\nbusiness of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others. Unlike a broker, who acts as agent,\na dealer acts as principal. The Act generally defines a \"dealer\" as any person engaged in the business of\nbuying and selling securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise. [Source: the SEC’s guide\nto broker-dealer registration, http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/bdguide.htm#II]\n3\n\nI would note that Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and New York Fed President William Dudley\nhave raised concerns about broker-dealers and wholesale funding markets. See\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm and\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130201.html. In the former Governor Tarullo\ndiscusses “three proposals currently being debated in policy circles: (1) breaking up large financial\ninstitutions by reinstating Glass-Seagull restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of\ncommercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placing a cap on the non-deposit liabilities of financial\ninstitutions; and (3) requiring financial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of\nlong-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled\nfirm.”\n4\n\nThe final auctions for the PDCF and TSLF were in May and July of 2009, respectively. My graphs end in\nMay and Aug 2009, not Feb 2010, because while the program still existed in those latter months, there were\nno loans outstanding.\n5\n\nMy colleague William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, discussed access to the discount window\nin a speech entitled “Fixing Wholesale Funding to Build a More Stable Financial System,” available at\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130201.html. In it he said “The other path\nwould be to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central\nbank’s lender of last resort function. […] We have banking activity — maturity transformation — taking\nplace today outside commercial banks. If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation\nservices to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the\nsame logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to\nbackstop the banking activity taking place in the markets in a similar way. However, any expansion of\naccess to a lender of last resort would require legislation and it would be essential to have the right quid pro\nquo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight. […] Extension of discount\nwindow-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with\nprudential regulation of these institutions. Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.”\n6\n\nOur PDCF peak ($156 billion) is calculated using daily data and differs from the peak that is calculated\nand often reported using weekly data ($146.6 billion). Similarly our TSLF data is weekly, as of Fridays,\nwhereas it is often published as of Wednesdays.\n7\n\nFigures for the Term Securities Lending Facility reflect expected maturities and may not reflect early\nreturns of loans outstanding.\n8\n\nSee http://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/062912/index.htm, particularly the\ndiscussion of broker-dealer financing beginning on page 11, and especially Figure 11.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 57th Economic\nConference:\n“Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate – Monetary Policy & The\nLabor Market”\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 12, 2013\nThe data in this speech have been updated to reflect revisions to the data series that occurred\nafter it was delivered. These updates were made because the speech was being prepared for\npublication in an issue of the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking.\n\nIt is a pleasure to welcome everyone attending the Boston Fed’s 57th economic\nconference. The topic of this year’s conference – fulfilling the full employment mandate – is\nparticularly relevant today, when most developed countries have unemployment rates\nsubstantially above their estimates of full employment.\nI see a number of important questions about the full employment mandate that should be\nexplored at this conference and beyond. For example, how should central banks react to high\nunemployment rates in a period of well-anchored inflation expectations? Does the\nunconventional nature of many of the monetary policy tools currently being employed alter how\n\n1\n\n\fcentral banks should think about their mandate? And even more fundamentally, what should be\nthe mandate of central banks – should there be a single inflation goal, as occurs in many\ncountries around the world, or should there be a dual mandate as has evolved in the United\nStates?\nMy answer to this last question is an emphatic yes, by the way – the Fed should have a\ndual mandate. But I expect that conference participants and those reading the papers and\npresentations from afar will gain fresh perspectives on these and other important questions.\nBefore I begin my remarks I would like to note that the views I express today are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nIn the United States, we currently have an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent and an\ninflation rate of 1.5 percent using the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index.\nFalling short on both elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress – inflation\nand employment – provides a strong rationale for continuing our highly accommodative\nmonetary policy. With inflation at 1.5 percent, and with my own forecast that inflation will\nremain well below our 2 percent target over the next two years, one could argue that consistently\nmissing our inflation target alone would justify a highly accommodative policy. However,\ncoupled with persistently high unemployment, the justification for continuing highly\naccommodative policy by large-scale asset purchases is clear. This is a time when the dual\nmandate is important and, I would add, particularly useful for communicating policy to the\ngeneral public.\nThe dual mandate is being utilized in recent Federal Reserve policy statements to clearly\ndescribe to the public how monetary policy will be conducted, going forward. In particular,\n\n2\n\n\frecent FOMC policy statements have made explicit reference to the role of employment in\nconsidering changes to our monetary policy stance. With regard to the Fed’s large-scale asset\npurchase program, the March statement said the FOMC will continue purchases “until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”\nThe FOMC statement highlights that maintaining interest rates at exceptionally low\nlevels will be appropriate “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage\npoint above the Committee’s 2 percent long-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations\ncontinue to be well anchored.” Data for both inflation and unemployment measures are readily\navailable, and with the publication four times a year of the Committee’s projections for these\nvariables via the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) 1 the public can observe the FOMC’s\noutlook for these measures as well.\nBoth inflation and unemployment are viewed by the public as important gauges of\neconomic well-being, so tying the trajectory of policy to data and published forecasts for these\neconomic outcomes clarifies things for the public. In fact, this type of central bank\ncommunication has been quite effective. With a clearer understanding of the policy objective,\nyield curves have flattened and forward rates have fallen to reflect policy announcements.\nSuch announcements would likely not be as straightforward in countries with a single\nmandate related only to inflation. In such countries, a modest shortfall in inflation relative to\ntarget would not by itself justify a significant monetary policy response. In circumstances such\nas today’s, invoking a non-mandated “escape clause” to attend to real activity while inflation is\nwell-contained would not do justice to the size of the problems in the real economy. To be sure,\nmany countries have found ways around these difficulties in recent times, but the Federal\n\n3\n\n\fReserve’s dual mandate is especially well suited for times like these, when it is clear that the\nprimary rationale for our aggressive policies derives from the first-order problems in labor\nmarkets, not from a second-order escape clause that “permits” (but does not mandate) monetary\npolicymakers to consider labor markets.\nGiven the communication challenges that are present with a single inflation mandate at a\ntime of a significant slack in resources (high unemployment), it is natural to ask if there are\nsignificant differences in how central banks with a single inflation mandate behave relative to\ncentral banks with a dual mandate. The conclusion I will reach – by looking at the data – is that\nwith a dual mandate in the United States, our inflation outcomes have been at least as good as\nthose in countries with a single mandate, and we have the added benefit of a much clearer and\nmore direct way to communicate with the public.\nI would note that several nations have been considering revisiting their central bank\nmandate. The evidence I will share with you today suggests that there should be a broader\nconsideration of moving to a dual mandate, such as we have in the United States.\nTo give you an overview of my presentation today, I will first explore whether countries\nwith a single mandate, focused solely on inflation, generate different outcomes. Then I will\nexplore the issue of central bank actions when inflation exceeds the target. I will follow with a\ndiscussion of current policy in the United States and the role played by the dual mandate, before\noffering some concluding observations.\n\nDo Countries with a Single Inflation Mandate Generate Better Outcomes?\nThe first matter I would like to explore is the inflation experience of single mandate\nversus dual mandate countries. The data show that many countries over the past 20 years have\n\n4\n\n\fbeen very close to a 2 percent average inflation rate over that period; a result that is surprisingly\nconsistent with price level targeting, where large increases or decreases in inflation are offset in\nfuture periods to maintain the same average inflation rate. Interestingly, by this measure the\nUnited States performs a bit better than countries that use only an inflation mandate.\nFigure 1 shows the inflation experience of the U.S., the Euro area, 2 and Japan over the\npast 20 years. The price level for each is indexed to 100 in January of 1993. The Federal\nReserve now has a 2 percent inflation target tied to the PCE inflation index, and the red line\nindicates the path the price level would take if inflation were exactly 2 percent for the entire 20\nyear period (which would be consistent with either error-less inflation targeting or perfect price\nlevel targeting).\nWhile the 2 percent inflation target was only officially adopted by the FOMC in January\n2012, the figure suggests that the Federal Reserve observed an implicit inflation target of 2\npercent over this 20-year period. The actual path followed by the PCE level is represented by the\ndarker blue line. The fact that the PCE price index always returns to the 2 percent line over the\n20-year period implies, naturally, that the average inflation rate over that period was 2 percent.\nAlso, the proximity of the PCE price index to the 2 percent line indicates that inflation deviated\nvery little from 2 percent during that period. The only period of significant divergence occurred\nwhen oil prices rose significantly in 2008, and that divergence clearly proved temporary.\nOne might think that the unexpectedly severe “Great Recession” forced the inflation rate\nback to the 2 percent path. However, it is interesting to note that even before the Great\nRecession, the average was very close to 2 percent. With inflation generally falling at the\nbeginning of this period, the pattern is consistent with a U.S. monetary policy that may not have\n“forgiven” the period of above-target inflation as “water over the dam,” as a 2 percent inflation\n\n5\n\n\ftargeting central bank would, but instead engineered below-2 percent inflation in the ensuing\nperiod, to achieve a 2 percent average inflation rate – much like a price-level targeting central\nbank would.\nThis in turn implies a central bank that was more restrictive following the period of\nabove-2 percent inflation than a pure inflation-targeter would be, potentially leading to a higher\nunemployment rate than would otherwise have been the case. Of course, it is possible that these\ninflation outcomes simply arose from a pattern of exogenous shocks (such as oil shocks) to\ninflation that produced an average inflation rate of 2 percent, in spite of the central bank’s\nactions. But whether this pattern arose by chance or design, the chart is striking. The chart also\nhighlights that during the most recent period of highly elevated unemployment – when we have\nremained persistently below 2 percent inflation – we could have justified even more\naccommodative policy than was generally enacted.\nThe Euro area’s harmonized price level index is shown on the chart in lighter blue.\nWhile also quite close to the 2 percent line, the inflation rate in Europe has tended to be higher\nthan that of the United States, and at the end of the 20-year period is above the 2 percent line,\nand above the inflation index for the United States. Of course, the ECB took control of monetary\npolicy in January 1999, at the inception of the euro, but the statement is still true if one begins\nthis exercise at that time.\nThe other line provides the index for Japan. While recently the Bank of Japan has\ndiscussed a 2 percent inflation target, that does not appear to have been the target over the last 20\nyears. Reflecting the inflation outcome, it would appear that the Bank of Japan has been\nfollowing essentially a zero percent price level target and that the recently announced intent to\n\n6\n\n\fhit a 2 percent target, if implemented, will be a significant change from the past 20 years in\nJapan.\nGiven the very different inflation target and outcome for Japan during much of the last\ntwo decades, I will today focus on countries that have been following a 2 percent inflation target.\nFigure 2 shows the price level path for the U.S., the U.K., and Sweden. Both the U.K. and\nSweden have 2 percent inflation targets, and both remain fairly close to the 2 percent line.\nHowever, at the end of the 20-year period, the U.K. is above the 2 percent line and above the\ninflation experience of the U.S. while Sweden is below. Clearly the United States has yielded no\nworse outcomes on inflation than other countries with a single mandate. 3\nIn terms of inflation outcomes, all countries have been relatively close to the 2 percent\ninflation line (with the exception of Japan), consistent with a move toward well-anchored\nexpectations in all of these countries. However, it is notable that even with a dual mandate the\nUnited States is the country closest to the 2 percent line at the end of the 20-year period.\nIt is, of course, possible that over two decades inflation could average 2 percent, but that\na country with a dual mandate might allow inflationary pressures to build up more than a country\nwhose sole mandate was inflation, leading to more pronounced swings of inflation (and the price\nlevel) around its target. One way to explore this possibility is to examine the cumulative squared\ndeviation of inflation from the 2 percent target – a measure that places greater weight on large\nmisses from the target. Figure 3 provides the cumulative squared deviations of the annual (year\nover year) inflation rate from a 2 percent inflation target. The analysis 4 is symmetric, meaning it\nplaces an equal weight on large misses above 2 percent and similarly on large deviations below 2\npercent.\n\n7\n\n\fThe most rapid increase in the cumulative squared deviation from the inflation target for\nthe United States was in 2008, when rising oil prices caused a sharp increase in energy prices\nthat persisted for several quarters. However, in the period after 2009 the U.S. line really flattens.\nThe unemployment rate remained quite elevated, and the inflation rate stayed quite close to the 2\npercent target and, in fact, is much flatter than in Sweden and the U.K., which have only an\ninflation mandate. In addition, the misses – the cumulative squared deviations from the inflation\ntarget – over the entire period are smaller for the U.S. than for the U.K. or Sweden, but\nsomewhat higher than for the Euro area.\nHowever, since much of the miss in the United States is the result of the temporary spike\nin oil prices in 2008, it is worth examining whether underlying inflation measured by core\ninflation provides the same picture. Core inflation measures exclude the volatile food and\nenergy segments that are obviously very important but are not controllable by central banks.\nFigure 4 provides the cumulative squared deviations of core inflation from a 2 percent target.\nFor the United States we see that the increases in the cumulative squared deviations from the\ninflation target are quite gradual over the entire period. Perhaps even more notable, using core\ninflation the cumulative squared deviations for the U.S. are lower than those of the U.K.,\nSweden, or the Euro area. Furthermore, when the unemployment rate is the highest in the United\nStates, the increases in the cumulative squared deviations are less than in the other three areas.\nNow I’d like to show a figure, first with the countries not labeled and then with them\nlabeled. This figure, Figure 5, provides a scatter chart depicting core inflation and\nunemployment outcomes over the past 16 years. The key question, I would suggest, is whether\ninflation and unemployment outcomes for the United States, with a dual mandate, look\nsignificantly different than for other countries.\n\n8\n\n\fIn terms of quarterly inflation outcomes, both Sweden and the U.K. have more highinflation observations than the United States. Sweden, the U.K., and the Euro area all have a\nhigher range of quarterly inflation outcomes than the United States. In terms of unemployment,\nthe United States has more density in unemployment rates between 4 and 6 percent relative to the\nother three, but the range of unemployment rates is wider than that of the U.K. and Sweden.\nThat the U.S. has a tighter inflation range and a broader unemployment range than many\nother countries with a single inflation mandate is striking, as is the very high unemployment rate\nin Europe. The results suggest that criticism that a dual mandate country might suffer from more\nfrequent and enduring spells of high inflation is overdone – and if anything the evidence might\nraise the question of whether, with a dual mandate, there should have been more aggressive\nmonetary accommodation during periods of elevated unemployment, particularly in the past five\nyears.\nAnother interesting aspect of the analysis shown in Figure 5 is whether the dual mandate\nresults in the United States having a larger concentration of high-inflation outcomes during\nperiods of high unemployment. But the opposite is true, as most of the high-inflation\nobservations occur during periods of low unemployment. Interestingly, for Sweden and the U.K.\nmore of the high-inflation observations are during periods of high unemployment, which might\npartly be attributable to open economies that may be more exposed to exchange rate and energy\nshocks.\nTo summarize, I would note that the dual mandate in the United States has been criticized\nby some for providing an inflationary bias. However, the data show little such evidence.\nInflation outcomes in the United States over the past 15-20 years appear to compare quite\nfavorably to those of single mandate countries.\n\n9\n\n\fCentral Banks’ Actions When Inflation Exceeds the Target\nOne way of capturing differences that might exist between single and dual mandate\ncountries is to examine whether single-mandate central banks were much more reticent to ease\npolicy if unemployment were high and they were currently somewhat above their inflation target.\nSuch an approach can certainly be justified when bound to a single mandate for inflation, but the\njustification for easing policy in such a circumstance would be that the inflation forecast suggests\nthat inflation will return to 2 percent. Contrast this with a dual mandate country, where rather\nthan relying on an inflation forecast that is expected to fall – possibly because of slack resources\n– the central bank can directly appeal to the elevated unemployment rate as balancing the\nconcerns over a somewhat elevated inflation.\nOver the past five years, short-term interest rates in many countries have been close to, or\nat, the zero lower bound. So it may be instructive to explore just how willing countries have\nbeen to expand their central bank’s balance sheet during periods of above-target inflation.\nFigure 6 shows the core rate of inflation in the U.S. and the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet in recent years. The only observations of core inflation above 2 percent were in 2008.\nHowever, this was the period of the most rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\nWith a dual mandate, a period of fast-rising unemployment rates makes it straightforward to\ncommunicate the need to rapidly expand the balance sheet.\nFigure 7 provides similar information for the Bank of England. Unlike the United States,\nthe core inflation rate in the U.K. has been above 2 percent for much of this period.\nInterestingly, the most rapid expansion of the balance sheet occurred in late 2008 when core\ninflation was above 2 percent, and the balance sheet began to grow further in 2011 when\ninflation was well above the 2 percent target. So, despite the single mandate, the Bank of\n\n10\n\n\fEngland has been willing to expand its balance sheet even with core inflation rates persistently\nhigher than target.\nFigure 8 contains similar information for the Euro area and the European Central Bank.\nThe most rapid increase – but not the largest – in the balance sheet was in 2008 when the core\ninflation rate was above 2 percent. While core inflation remained below 2 percent for the rest of\nthe period, the expansion of the balance sheet resumed in 2011 when the core inflation rate was\nat a local maximum very close to 2 percent.\nFigure 9 provides the same information for Sweden. Sweden, like other countries,\nincreased its balance sheet when core inflation was above 2 percent. What is distinctive about\nSweden is the reduction in the central bank’s balance sheet, and how low their balance sheet has\nremained despite being well below 2 percent core inflation.\nThe good news is that periods of higher inflation do not seem to constrain any of these\ncountries from easing monetary policy when the real economy is in serious distress, even if they\nare above a 2 percent inflation target. But again, I would observe that with a dual mandate, the\ncommunication around these periods and policy actions is likely to be much more\nstraightforward. Perhaps a lesson to draw from these episodes is that, regardless of the formal\nstructure of the central bank, all of us are dual mandate banks “at heart.”\n\nCurrent Policy in the United States and the Dual Mandate\nFigure 10 looks at an estimate of the period-by-period loss function for the U.S. central\nbank, proxied by the squared deviations of inflation from an inflation target (not cumulative) in\nthe top panel, and the squared deviations of unemployment from an estimate of full employment\nutilizing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessment of the natural rate for each year\n\n11\n\n\f(not cumulative) in the bottom panel. There is no stated inflation target for the United States\nduring much of the sample period, so that during the earlier periods a filter is utilized that\nprovides a smoothed inflation target that ranges from 2 to 5 percent. 5\nFigure 11 stacks the deviations from the previous two charts. The misses from inflation\nare shown in dark blue and the misses from unemployment are in light blue. In effect this\nreflects a loss function that places an equal weight on inflation misses and unemployment\nmisses. Parenthetically, I would point out that an interesting question to consider is whether the\npossibility of long-term effects of unemployment, as will be discussed during this conference,\nshould alter the relative weights of inflation and unemployment in the loss function.\nMost of the large misses in the 1970s and early 1980s were the result of very high\ninflation rates. After the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced inflation rates under the\nleadership of Chairman Volker, inflation has remained well anchored and has not resulted in\nlarge inflation misses. What is more striking is that now the misses have been associated with\nperiods of high unemployment. The Great Recession resulted in such a large miss in\nunemployment that the squared deviations were higher than in any period in the past 30 years.\nEven now, the squared deviations remain at a high point for the past 20 years. This may indicate\nthat during the period of the 1970s and early 1980s too little weight may have been placed on\ninflation misses but in the more recent past we may have placed too little weight on\nunemployment misses – and if anything, we should have acted more aggressively to reduce the\nunemployment rate.\nWith the unemployment rate at 7.5 percent and both core and total PCE inflation at 1.5\npercent, the communication of accommodative monetary policy is quite straightforward. We are\n\n12\n\n\fwell above our unemployment target and well below our inflation target, so highly\naccommodative policy is both appropriate and necessary.\nFurthermore, the dual mandate, coupled with the FOMC’s January “framework”\nstatement, has made it easier to provide forward guidance. The threshold language has clearly\nstated that unemployment is an important objective of monetary policy and an important\ndeterminant of when we will begin to raise short-term interest rates. Similarly, the FOMC\nstatement makes clear that we are looking for substantial improvement in outlook for the labor\nmarket, in a context of price stability, before stopping large-scale asset purchases. Given how far\nwe are below the 2 percent inflation target, these actions could be motivated by large misses on\ninflation – but the dual mandate provides a much clearer, more transparent, and direct way to\ncommunicate with the public.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe dual mandate in the United States has provided a clear and transparent way to\ncommunicate the need for aggressive monetary policy. Our inflation outcomes have been as\ngood as, if not better than, many countries with a single inflation mandate. Furthermore, many\ncentral banks with only a single inflation mandate have chosen to expand monetary policy\naccommodation despite being at or above a 2 percent inflation target.\nThe general similarity of actions across central banks, despite differing mandates, is\nilluminating. Again I would suggest that the dual mandate may have made the communication\naround our actions easier than in single mandate countries. But the historical record shows that\neven this dual mandate central bank may have been a bit slow to place sufficient emphasis on\nunemployment deviations. If that is the case, then as countries consider or reconsider their\n\n13\n\n\fcentral banks’ mandate, moving to a dual mandate may provide dual benefits: on the\ncommunications front, it will make it easier to provide forward guidance that conditions on both\ninflation and employment outcomes. On the policy action front, a dual mandate may help to\nensure that employment gets an appropriate weighting in the central bank’s assessment of\nappropriate policy, particularly during times when employment ranks first in terms of economic\nwoes.

The U.S. is the classic large\nsemi-open economy, while Sweden is close to a classic small open economy; the U.K. and the larger pre-Euro E.U.\ncountries fall somewhere in between. One would expect monetary expansion in a small open economy to cause a\ntemporary increase in measured inflation due to exchange rate depreciation (as the prices of tradables increase) even\nwhen unemployment is above the natural rate (although the inflation increase would be small if there is limited\nexchange rate pass-through).\n4\n\nA quadratic loss function.\n\n5\n\nThe target inflation series is constructed by running a Hodrick-Prescott filter with smoothing parameter 1,600,000\nover the core PCE inflation rate from 1959 to the present.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nEarly Childhood Summit 2013: Innovation and\nOpportunity\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston,\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 5, 2013\n\nI am pleased to be participating in this early childhood summit. And I would\nparticularly like to thank the Boston Children’s Museum for continuing its tradition of\ninnovative work on behalf of children by co-sponsoring this and other events during this\ntheir centennial year. The Boston Children’s Museum is a close neighbor of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, and my children and I personally benefitted from this proximity\nas we often took advantage of its many exhibits and programs. It was the only museum\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthat my children did not respond with, “not another museum” when I told them where we\nwere going that day.\nI became aware of some of the important economic work being done on early\nchildhood programs in a series of discussions I had over the years with fellow Fed\neconomist, Art Rolnick. Art was then the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Minneapolis and made two important observations. First, if you help someone early in\nlife, they reap a lifetime of benefits. And a second close corollary is that programs that\nhelp kids learn have a high return for them as individuals and for society as a whole.\nThese observations have been validated by good empirical research and have served as a\nfoundation for the funding of important programs that apply these observations. Others\non the agenda today are going to discuss such programs in more detail.\nWhile many of the economic studies on the value of good early childhood\nprograms have focused on the average return from these investments, I am going to\ndiscuss how educational attainment can impact the variability of a person’s economic\noutcomes. In particular, during economic downturns, those with poor educational\nattainment are disproportionately likely to become unemployed and that unemployment\ncan have a far-reaching impact on other aspects of life, including expected future\nearnings, wealth and home ownership.\nThe second point I will emphasize today is the importance of helping those\ncommunities that have the fewest resources available to address both economic and social\nproblems. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been doing significant work in midsized cities in New England, and we will be announcing a new mid-sized cities initiative\nin Massachusetts next month in conjunction with a number of partners including the\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, Living Cities, and the Massachusetts Competitive\nPartnership. Today I want to highlight that if you are living in a mid-sized city in\nMassachusetts with a high poverty rate, your chances of educational attainment look\nquite different from what they would be if you lived in a mid-sized city with a low\npoverty rate. While there has been progress in more widespread adoption of early\nchildhood education – especially in reaching communities that have difficulty affording\nsuch programs – it is exactly these communities that potentially generate the highest\nreturns on such investment. This is particularly important because these investments not\nonly influence educational attainment as a youth, but can be an important element in\nemployment opportunities and job retention as an adult, even during difficult economic\ntimes, such as those we continue to experience.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Variability of Economic Outcomes\nFigure 1 displays the unemployment rate by educational attainment. First, notice\nthat the unemployment rate for less educated workers is always significantly higher than\nthe rate for more highly educated workers. Second, while the unemployment rate\napproximately doubled during the Great Recession across all education categories, the\nunemployment rates of people with low educational attainment rose to staggering levels.\nFor those with less than a high school education, the unemployment rate was a bit below\n8 percent prior to the recession and reached a peak of almost 16 percent as a result of the\nrecession. Thus, nearly one in six people with less than a high school education were\nunemployed at one point during the recession. Thankfully, the unemployment rate for\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthose with low educational attainment has come down, despite the only modest overall\nrecovery we have had to date.\nWhile it is well established that spells of unemployment have a significant\nnegative impact on labor income for years, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff recently\nexamined the impact that a long duration of unemployment has on future labor income.1\nTheir research found that 10 years after a spell of unemployment, an individual makes 16\npercent less on average than an individual who did not experience that spell of\nunemployment. The impact is even larger with longer-duration unemployment. After 20\nyears, the earnings of a short-duration unemployed worker are roughly the same as those\nwithout a spell of unemployment, but the individual with a long-duration spell of\nunemployment is still somewhat worse off. Furthermore, there is no “catch up” for the\nyears of lost income. It is important to note that our staff found that longer-duration\nunemployment is negatively correlated with education.\nNot surprisingly, those lost opportunities result in unfavorable collateral effects.\nFor example, spells of unemployment have a significantly negative impact on future\nhomeownership rates, and those who experience a period of long-duration unemployment\nhave a significant permanent loss in wealth.2 Spells of unemployment also entail huge\nnon-pecuniary costs to the individual and the family.\nSuch observations are important in a variety of contexts, but let me mention two.\nIn terms of monetary policy, it implies that spells of unemployment can have a lasting\nimpact long after the economy recovers. If spells of unemployment have a persistent\nimpact on income, wealth and home ownership, then a more aggressive response to\npersistently high unemployment rates is warranted. More rapid economic growth is\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlikely to not only reduce the unemployment rate, but also reduce some of the collateral\ndamage the economy may otherwise face from the spells of long-duration unemployment.\nContinued accommodative policy, such as continuing our asset purchase program\nthrough this year, is an appropriate response to labor market scarring.\nParticularly relevant for today’s discussion is that the failure to help children\nreach their highest potential educational attainment level can have a significant impact on\ntheir likelihood of experiencing significant economic shocks when the economy\nexperiences a downturn. This much greater risk of unemployment as an adult for the\nchild who does not receive a sufficient education impacts a variety of other economic\noutcomes, such as whether an individual can buy a home or accumulate wealth to afford a\nreasonable retirement or educate their children.\nA critical factor in obtaining sufficient education in many disadvantaged areas is\nthe availability of programs that help maximize a child’s potential. Government cuts that\ndo not consider the long-run return on investment from such programs are likely to be\nboth economically inefficient and could potentially cause longer-run harm to the\neconomy.\n\nA Comparison of Massachusetts Cities\nI would like to highlight differences in educational attainment by examining\nMassachusetts mid-sized cities with the highest poverty rates versus those with the lowest\npoverty rates.3 These charts demonstrate that patterns in failure to obtain a high school\neducation actually are fairly persistently present in the data by educational outcome at\nmuch earlier ages.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 2 shows the differences in the share of children under age five living below\nthe poverty level, comparing those cities with the lowest overall poverty rates to those\nwith the highest poverty rates as well as to the statewide average for all cities and towns.\nIn four of the five high poverty mid-sized cities, more than 40 percent of the children\nunder age five are living below the poverty level. In all five cities, the share of children\nunder age five living below the poverty level is more than double the average for\nMassachusetts. Among the cities with the lowest poverty rates, four of the five cities\nhave child poverty rates less than half the Massachusetts average of 16.8 percent.\nFigure 3 shows that differences for children occur as early as three or four years\nof age. In the low poverty mid-sized cities, 67.7% of children age three and four are\nenrolled in a preschool or pre-kindergarten program. In contrast, less than half – 42.6% –\nof children age three and four are enrolled in school in the high poverty mid-sized cities.\nLawrence has the lowest share at 26.8%.\nFigure 4 shows that the patterns of enrollment visible in Figure 3 are quite similar\nto the patterns in third grade Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)\ntest scores. Cities with high poverty rates report much lower scores on both the reading\nand math MCAS tests, sometimes having less than half the proficiency rate of cities with\nlow poverty rates. Though there are many population differences between high and low\npoverty mid-sized cities that can affect test scores, it appears that early school enrollment\nis a critical factor that clearly has an effect on student achievement.4\nFigure 5 shows that these patterns persist with high school graduation rates. In all\nfive low poverty cities, 80 percent or more of students graduate from high school in four\nyears. In all five high poverty cities, less than 70 percent of students graduate from high\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nschool in four years. In four of the five high poverty cities, the high school graduation\nrate is 61 percent or lower. This has implications for future earning power, as those who\ndo not graduate from high school earn much less on average than those with higher\neducational attainment. As I highlighted in the beginning of my talk, this also has\nsignificant implications for the likelihood of experiencing a spell of unemployment with\nthe associated collateral impact. Thus, not only the stream of earnings but also the\nvolatility of earnings may be impacted.\nChildren in high poverty cities face considerable challenges on many levels.\nHowever, access to educational opportunities can have a significant impact on their\neconomic outcomes throughout their lives. Given the discrepancies between childhood\noutcomes related to education, both public and private resources need to be focused on\nproviding more educational and developmental opportunities for children living in cities\nwith fewer resources, resources that have been particularly strained over the past five\nyears.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe work of this conference is important. There is more to be done to make sure\nthat all children have the opportunity to succeed and flourish. Educational opportunity is\nan important element in the likelihood of that happening.\nI do want to end on a positive note. Figure 6 shows that there has been a\nsignificant increase in the number of children with access to full day kindergarten.\nResearch and policy advocacy regarding early childhood education has had an impact,\nand resources from private and public sources are increasingly providing more\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, April 5, 2013 at 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neducational opportunities for children. However, as my charts indicate, more work needs\nto be done, and I hope all of us in this room will do our part to make that happen.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThis research was included in a March 13, 2013 memo by Daniel Cooper, Senior Economist at\n\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, titled “Effects of Employment Duration on Earnings and Other\nOutcomes.”\n2\n\nIt is important to emphasize that one cannot perfectly distinguish between extended\n\nunemployment spells that result from “sorting” in the labor market, such that less-productive workers are\nthe first unemployed and the last to find new jobs, versus bad luck on the part of a productive employee\nwhose firm failed. But one only needs to assume that a modest portion of these long-duration\nunemployment spells reflect the bad luck case to arrive at sizable long-run impacts of extended\nunemployment.\n3\n\nTo select the mid-sized cities in Massachusetts with the highest and lowest poverty rates, cities\n\nwith population of 35,000 – 200,000 were sorted by population poverty rate (the share of all people whose\nincome was below the poverty level), using the three-year estimates for 2009 – 2011 from the American\nCommunity Survey (ACS).\n4\n\nIn addition, reading at grade level in third grade has been correlated with a reduction in later\n\ndropout rates.\n\n8\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Business and Industry Association of\nNew Hampshire and the New Hampshire\nBankers Association\nSaint Anselm College, Manchester, NH\nMarch 27, 2013\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back in New Hampshire to discuss the economic outlook\nwith you. While economic growth was modest in the latter part of 2012, recent data\nsuggest some improvement in the first part of this year. On balance economic growth has\nbeen a bit better than expected, considering the notable headwinds of fiscal restraint and\nissues in Europe that reflect the still-fragile global recovery. The current expectation of\nmany private-sector forecasters is that the economy will expand slightly more rapidly\nthan its potential rate of growth in the near term.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nStill, the economy remains far from where we want it to be, especially given the\nFed’s dual mandate for maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The\nnational unemployment rate is 7.7 percent, far higher than the 5.25 percent\nunemployment rate to which I think the economy will eventually return. Similarly, the\ninflation rate (measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index or PCE)\nover the twelve months ending in January 2013 averaged only 1.2 percent, far below the\nFederal Reserve’s PCE inflation target of 2 percent.\nToday, I will discuss both the economic outlook and the role that monetary policy\nhas played in the improving economy. Certainly the “no free lunch” doctrine applies\nhere, so along with the benefits there are some potential costs. I will discuss some of the\npotential costs of our current policies, particularly those dealing with financial stability.\nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\nTo preview my conclusions, I will argue that the Federal Reserve’s policy of\nopen-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities –\ncurrently proceeding at a pace of $85 billion a month – has contributed importantly to the\ngradual improvement in labor markets that we have seen, despite the fiscal headwinds. I\nwill also argue that the costs of these policies are outweighed by their benefits, and by the\ncosts likely to result if we did not pursue them.\nIt is clear to me that monetary policy actions have been benefiting the economy.\nSome observers argue that the beneficial effects are offset by the cost of reduced financial\nstability. Certainly, this is an area we need to watch closely. Financial stability is\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nexceptionally important to me personally, as my research and talks underscore. I have\nbeen vocal about significant policy actions that, in my view, should be taken to avoid\nfinancial stability problems in the future. However, I see little evidence that our\nmonetary policies are generating significant financial stability problems at this time.\nPut simply, the benefits of our asset purchases have exceed any reasonable\nestimate of the costs. The asset-purchase program is having the desired impact, and the\nfaster economic growth that is in part the result of monetary policy actions will bring us\nmore quickly to a situation where this degree of additional accommodation is no longer\nnecessary.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nI expect the economy to grow at a rate a bit above 2 percent in the first half of this\nyear, despite the headwinds resulting from more fiscal austerity than many expected. As\nFigure 1 shows, government spending, a GDP component, has declined for the past two\nyears – even before the federal sequester. This is true for federal spending as well as\nstate and local government spending. Fiscal austerity has been offset in part by\nimprovements in housing and also auto sales (part of consumer durables). Housing and\nautos are the most interest-sensitive components of GDP, and their strength partly reflects\nthe positive impact of Federal Reserve policies to push long-term interest rates down with\nour large-scale asset purchase program.\nFigure 2 provides the longer-run economic forecasts of the 19 Reserve Bank\npresidents and Federal Reserve Board governors who participate on the FOMC, taken\nfrom the periodic report known as the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP.1 Once\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\na quarter, each FOMC participant is asked to provide an economic forecast for a variety\nof variables, including the unemployment rate and the PCE inflation rate.\nIn the left panel, the range and midpoint of forecasts for unemployment at the end\nof 2013 and 2014 are provided for the most recent FOMC meeting, in March, and for the\nFOMC meeting last September when we began the open-ended purchases of mortgagebacked securities. Last September the FOMC participants expected the unemployment\nrate at the end of 2013 would range from 7 to 8 percent, with a midpoint of 7.5. At the\nMarch FOMC meeting the range from the SEP was narrower and lower – the range was\nnow from 6.9 to 7.6 percent, and the midpoint had dropped by 25 basis points.\nMy own forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is just above the\nmidpoint of the range. Similarly, the forecast range for unemployment at the end of 2014\nis now lower, and the midpoint fell by 30 basis points to 6.6 percent. For 2014, my\nforecast is again just a bit above the midpoint. In sum, FOMC participants see\nimprovement in the unemployment forecast since last September – for both 2013 and\n2014. And, comparing the midpoints of the unemployment rate forecast for the two years\nshows that the overall level has declined, but the size of the decline expected over 2014 is\nthe same – six tenths.\nTurning to the right-side panel, the midpoint of the PCE inflation forecast for\nFOMC participants fell from 1.8 to 1.65 for 2013 between the September FOMC and the\nMarch FOMC meetings. Furthermore, the midpoint forecast for 2014 fell from 1.9 to\n1.75. My own forecast is below the midpoint of the range for both 2013 and 2014.\nIn sum, the March SEP was quite positive, with declines in the midpoint of the\nforecast ranges for both unemployment and PCE inflation, in 2013 and 2014. However,\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\neven at the end of 2014, unemployment is expected to be almost 1.5 percentage points\nabove most estimates of full employment. Given that the midpoint for the inflation\nforecast for both years is below our 2 percent target, I believe we have the flexibility to\npursue a policy that encourages faster economic growth and a more rapid improvement in\nthe unemployment rate. To me, that implies that we should continue our large-scale asset\npurchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities through this year – although the\namount may need to be adjusted up or down, depending on how the economic situation\nevolves.\n\nBenefits and Costs of Large-Scale Asset Purchases\nThe Fed’s purchases of long-term securities are intended to lower longer-term\ninterest rates, like rates on home mortgages and auto loans, in order to promote faster\neconomic growth. These purchases also encourage households and businesses to shift\nsomewhat from riskless low-yielding short-term government securities to investments\nthat bear a sensible degree of risk and have a stronger economic effect, like corporate\nbonds and stocks.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston staff use two different models to estimate the\nimpact of asset purchases on the economy. One explicitly articulates household and\nbusiness behaviors2 and the other is a purely statistical model.3 Reassuringly, both\nmodels give similar results. Our best estimate implies roughly a one-quarter-point\ndecrease in the unemployment rate for a $500 billion asset-purchase program.\nBy this estimate, the benefits of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program\ninclude almost 400,000 additional workers employed for every $500 billion in purchased\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nassets (which earn a return while on the Fed’s books), returning to our inflation target\nsomewhat more quickly, and a somewhat better debt-to-GDP ratio as a result of the lower\ninterest rates and improved GDP and revenue growth. While these estimates are model\ndependent, and are clearly subject to estimation error, they are broadly consistent with\nother studies – and with the growth in asset prices and the expansion of the interestsensitive components of GDP seen since last September.\nOne of the potential costs of LSAPs would be that they could be viewed as\ninflationary. Most of the original critics of LSAPs voiced concerns over the potential\nimpact on inflation and inflation expectations. However, the expansion of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet began in 2008 and five years later we currently have a PCE\ninflation rate of 1.2 percent, well below our 2 percent target. As the years have passed\nand inflation has remained stable, this criticism has become more muted.\nFOMC participants seem to agree with the assessment: looking at the range of\nFOMC participant forecasts from the SEP for March, most FOMC participants expect us\nto undershoot our 2 percent target this year. And in 2014, while the range extends to 2.1,\nmost indicate that inflation would be between 1.5 and 2.0 percent, undershooting or\nachieving the target (an observation based on the published central tendency of 1.5 to 2.0\npercent).\nA second concern expressed about LSAPs is that they might undermine financial\nstability. For example, if one expects the Fed to hold short-term rates at zero for a long\ntime, one could choose to earn higher yields by taking on substantially more credit risk or\ninterest rate risk.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIt is true that the Fed’s low interest rate policies are intended in part to encourage\nadditional, responsible risk-taking of the sort that advances real economic activity and\ngrowth – for example, spurring banks to lend more rather than hold cash or government\nsecurities, and non-financial firms to seek higher-return investment opportunities rather\nthan hold cash or government securities. However, it is possible that the expectation of\nvery low interest rates could encourage too much risk-taking – in the form of excessive\nleverage, or taking credit risks that could not withstand another economic slowdown.\nWhile some households or firms may choose to take excessive risks, even with more\nnormalized interest rates, it is the widespread taking of excessive risk – particularly by\nleveraged institutions – that is likely to generate macroeconomic financial stability\nproblems.\nSome observers have noted that stock prices have risen quite substantially, as\nshown in Figure 3. Of course our policy doesn’t specifically target a particular asset\nmarket, but encouraging investors and firms to take more of the responsible risks that\ncontribute to economic activity and growth would normally mean a shift into assets such\nas stocks and investments with higher expected returns.\nMake no mistake, this would pose a financial stability problem if stock prices had\nsignificantly outstripped likely earnings – particularly if those investing in stocks had\nbecome highly leveraged and were particularly susceptible to a reversal in share prices.\nFigure 4 shows the S&P stock index relative to composite operating earnings over the\npast 20 years. While share prices have risen, so have operating earnings. And while\nthere has been some increase in the ratio, it remains well below the 20-year average.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOther observers have noted that residential real estate prices have risen\nsignificantly in some markets, and that this could pose a financial stability problem.\nSince homes are normally purchased with significant debt, a rapid increase in prices\ncould risk a repeat of the problems of the past decade. Figure 5 looks at the Case-Shiller\nhome price index in a variety of metro areas. While housing prices have risen in many\nmarkets recently, they remain well below their peak prices.4 Furthermore, if one\ncompares an index of house prices to a rent index (shown in Figure 6), assessing whether\nthe values of homes are approximately in line with the services that housing provides, as\nreflected in rental rates, house prices have now fallen enough that this ratio is back to\nwhere it was in 1993, well before the run-up in house prices.\nAnother area of potential concern has been the increase in high-yield bond\nissuance. As Figure 7 shows, high-yield bond rates are now quite low by historical\nstandards. Firms with high-yield bonds are refinancing those bonds, much like many\nhomeowners have refinanced their houses. This refinancing improves the cash flow of\ncompanies and makes them more able to weather shocks. However, if these yields are\nlow because investors are bidding aggressively for such bonds, reaching or over-reaching\nfor higher yields in a low interest rate environment, then one would expect to see highyield bond rates fall more than relatively safe rates, reflecting the strong desire to take on\nmore of this debt at lower yields, despite its higher risk.\nBut Figure 8 shows that while the rates have fallen, the decline has largely been\ndue to the decline in all longer-term interest rates, including safe Treasury rates. The\nspread between high-yield bonds and 10-year Treasury securities is currently a little\nbelow the average spread over nearly two decades.5 That means that high-yield rates\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhave fallen approximately in line with the rates on safe assets, implying stable rather than\nsignificantly diminished compensation for risk. As Figure 9 shows, high-yield bond rates\nhave been declining in a manner quite similar to other rates, such as rates on home\nmortgages and auto loans.\nAnother way of looking at this data is that it highlights that the Fed’s program of\npurchasing long-term securities has affected a wide range of financial markets – from\nsafe Treasuries to mortgages to auto loans, well beyond the specific market where the\npurchases are occurring. Thus, the decline in high-yield bond rates looks broadly in line\nwith other market rates, and the widespread rate declines are contributing to a faster\nrecovery than we would otherwise have seen.\nAnother potential area of concern is banking. Asset price declines have much\ngreater economic impact if the assets are held by highly leveraged financial institutions\nthat may respond to losses by reducing credit availability.\nBut here the news is somewhat encouraging as well. Figure 10 shows the capital\nratios for the largest banks. Since the financial crisis in 2008, banks have restored their\ncapital ratios and have raised capital levels much higher than they were prior to the crisis\nand recession.6 This reflects both the banks’ tightening of their own capital levels, and\nthe impact of our stress tests which reveal whether banks are holding sufficient capital to\nweather an adverse economic, interest rate, or market shocks. The increased scrutiny of\ncapital and liquidity at banks has made banks much better positioned to withstand\npotential future economic shocks.\nEven with more capital and liquidity, however, banks can experience difficulties\nif they have very large positions in asset classes that could experience sharp declines in\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprices. Some observers have noted that farmland prices have experienced significant\nincreases in prices over the past several years. Figure 11 provides the banking industry’s\nexposure to agricultural loans by bank size. The largest banks have relatively small\nexposures to agricultural loans, less than 1 percent for the largest two categories (banks\nexceeding $1 trillion in assets and banks from $100 billion to $1 trillion in assets).\nFurthermore, in some parts of the country, like New England, and in urban based areas,\nbanks’ exposure to agricultural loans is quite modest.\nHowever, in agricultural areas of the country, some smaller banks have a\nsignificant exposure to agricultural loans. Such exposures are unlikely to pose financial\nstability concerns that affect the nation. In such circumstances, raising interest rates on\nall household and business borrowers, as some have suggested might be appropriate in\nresponse to a boom even in such a narrowly-held sector, seems to me a very blunt tool to\naddress this exposure. Instead, this seems a particularly good area for continued,\nenhanced supervisory focus with individual banks – with large agricultural exposures\nbeing challenged by bank supervisors to ensure the banks have sufficient capital to\nsustain a theoretical reversal in farmland prices.\nIn sum, broad-based financial stability concerns do not seem particularly acute at\nthis time. Interest rates in most markets have fallen, and asset prices are rising. This is\nthe expected and intentional result of the Fed’s efforts to promote a more rapid return to\nmore normalized conditions. As the economy continues to improve, and labor markets\nand inflation return to more normalized levels, the recent levels of monetary\naccommodation can be reduced.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThis is not to say we should not be vigilant about potential financial stability\nconcerns. We should remain humble about our ability to detect such imbalances, given\nour failure to do so in the recent crisis. Thus we should closely monitor whether the high\ndegree of monetary accommodation is having unintended consequences. I would now\nlike to briefly discuss some particular financial stability concerns that I believe should be\nwatched carefully.\n\nFinancial Stability Monitoring and the Need for Additional Regulatory Focus\nWhile the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy has been an\nimportant driver of the current economic recovery, and the financial stability costs appear\nrelatively modest at this time, we cannot be Pollyannas. There are areas that we should\nclosely monitor. Some areas that bear watching, in my view, are specific markets where\nunderwriting standards are slipping – or where rapid growth in financial products could\nbecome a more significant concern.\nIn terms of underwriting standards, the covenant quality on new high-yield bond\nissuance should be closely monitored. Bond covenants are intended to protect investors,\nand the issuance of bonds that reduce or eliminate common covenants in their contracts\ncould become an area of concern. In fact, there is some evidence that some new bond\nissuance reduces covenants that protect investors.7\nAlso, financial structures that involve the use of short-term borrowing to finance\nlonger-term assets should be monitored carefully. For example, agency real estate\ninvestment trusts (agency REITS) have grown rapidly, involve leverage, and are\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nsusceptible to sharp interest rate movements. Such financing structures need to be\nmonitored to ensure they do not pose broader financial stability concerns.\nFinally, many non-depository financial institutions that were susceptible to runs\nduring the financial crisis still have not resolved that run risk. For example, money\nmarket mutual funds experienced a severe run requiring substantial government\nintervention during the crisis, yet the regulatory reform effort is moving only slowly.\nSimilarly, Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo8 and New York Fed President\nWilliam Dudley9 have raised concerns about broker-dealers and wholesale funding\nmarkets. These concerns have substantial merit and deserve attention.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion and in sum, the economy continues to improve, but at a painfully\nslow pace. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve to speed up the pace of the economic\nrecovery seem to be having the desired impact. Interest-sensitive sectors are growing\nmore rapidly, asset markets are returning to pre-crisis levels, and economic forecasters\nare expecting continued improvements over the next several years.\nWhile the benefits of our actions continue to outweigh the costs, we need to\nclosely monitor financial instruments, financial institutions, and financial markets for\npotentially emerging financial stability concerns. There are areas that I have highlighted\ntoday that require close monitoring – including, unfortunately, some problems in\nfinancial market that were significant contributors to the financial crisis but have not yet\nbeen fully remedied.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 27, 2013 at 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile the economy is improving, global financial conditions remain fragile, as\nevents in Europe are highlighting. And the economy still has a long way to go before we\nhave full employment and PCE inflation at about 2 percent. Still, I believe the Federal\nReserve will continue to do its part in this process, with a clear focus on improving\neconomic conditions for all Americans.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe complete Summary of Economic Projections is released with the minutes of the FOMC meeting three\nweeks after the date of the policy decision.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBank for International Settlements Forum on Key Regulatory and\nSupervisory Issues in a Basel III World\nKeynote Address\nSeoul, Korea\nFebruary 25, 2013\n\nThe impact of the recent financial crisis has significantly changed the supervision and\nregulation of financial organizations.* Countries such as the U.K., Switzerland, and Sweden\nare not only planning on implementing the tougher Basel III capital standards, but are also\nconsidering whether they should require institutions to hold capital significantly above Basel\nIII capital levels.\n\n*\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nIn the United States, the financial crisis has caused reexamination of how we think\nabout bank regulation, bank supervision, and financial stability. Bank regulation before the\nfinancial crisis had become focused on using risk weighting to determine appropriate\nregulatory levels of bank capital. However, the risk weights on certain assets did not perform\nas expected when mortgages with low risk weights became the epicenter of problems, when\nmany securities that had high ratings and low capital charges fell dramatically in price, and\nwhen the originate-to-distribute (versus originate and hold) model1 of lending was exposed as\nnot distributing risk as widely as assumed.\nAssets with high ratings received little supervisory attention, as risk-focused\nsupervision focused on lower-quality assets. And off-balance-sheet exposures received\ninsufficient supervisory scrutiny. Supervisors gained a false sense of comfort from models\nthat aimed to look far out into the so-called tail of banks’ potential loss distributions. But,\nthese models failed to explicitly consider what would occur during times of severe\nmacroeconomic stress.\nIndeed it seems in hindsight that the very concept of financial stability was poorly\nunderstood before the financial crisis. Too little attention was devoted to the consequences\nof large institution failures, as the impact of such failures had not been fully considered in a\nway that adequately reflected a broader understanding of interconnected relationships. While\nliquidity had been receiving more attention at commercial banks, insufficient attention was\ngiven to the potential for runs on other financial institutions (for example broker-dealers) or\nproducts (such as money market mutual funds). Run risk was also badly underestimated in\nstructured investment vehicles and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, which\nbecame difficult to finance during the crisis.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nAs a result of these important crisis lessons, dramatic changes have been made. The\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the DFA), in\nconjunction with Basel III capital standards, significantly increased the quantity and quality of\ncapital expected to be held by banks. The introduction of stress tests, mandated by the DFA,\nincreased attention on whether capital will be sufficient during stressful situations. While\nrules have not yet been finalized in the U.S., there will be additional capital charges for\nsystemically important financial institutions. In addition, as required by the DFA, the largest\nbanks have already submitted plans describing how they may be resolved should that be\nnecessary.\nGiven the rapid changes occurring in supervision and regulation, some commenters\nhave argued that the regulatory pendulum has already overcompensated, and that capital\nrequirements are increasing too much and too fast. In particular, given the fragile state of the\nrecovery that has occurred in most advanced economies, some argue that new capital\nrequirements are overly conservative relative to historical experience and their imposition\ncould stall the economic recovery.\nToday, I will briefly examine the evidence for these arguments in the United States. I\nwill first examine whether regulatory capital thresholds are too high, based on evidence from\nthe financial crisis which will be more fully described in a forthcoming Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston working paper. The results of that work will highlight that capital depletion during\nthe financial crisis was extensive, and occurred relatively quickly, for many of the largest\nfinancial institutions in the United States – which is why it is critically important to examine\nwhether large financial institutions are holding sufficient capital.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nI will argue that the improvements in capital ratios that have occurred since the crisis\nare quite striking and have placed the U.S. economy in a better position to finance the\nrecovery going forward. If, however, enhanced capital were the only regulatory response to\nthe crisis, then our analysis would suggest that the size of the “SIFI surcharge” could be\ninsufficient. But in conjunction with the SIFI surcharges, regulators have undertaken several\nother significant reforms – including liquidity standards, stress tests and resolution plans. Our\nresults highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach.\nAnd contrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that\neven under the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge\ndoes not appear excessive. Throughout I will argue that as we better understand systemically\nimportant financial institutions, we may want to better integrate lessons from stress testing\nand resolution procedures into capital requirements for the largest banks.\n\nI. Capital Depletion at Systemically Important Institutions During the Financial Crisis\nA paper that will soon be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston uses\na panel of large, systemically important banks to examine the magnitude of capital erosion\nthat occurred during the financial crisis. The panel includes banks that failed, banks that were\nmerged into other institutions, and banks that survived the crisis intact. The analysis uses a\nvariety of adjustments to make the accounting measures of capital consistent across\ninstitutions – including removing sources of direct government capital support, adjusting for\nstructural changes to the firm, and making accounting adjustments for firms that were not\nbank holding companies throughout the period.2\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nThe paper examines how much Tier 1 common equity ratios deteriorated (the “capital\nerosion”) during each institution’s crisis period – defined as the period during the financial\ncrisis when the institution suffered its largest capital erosion.3\nThe results are shown in Figure 1. Not surprisingly, those institutions with the largest\ncapital erosion tended to be institutions that merged or failed during the crisis. These\ninstitutions tended to have a heavy exposure to residential real estate, like Washington Mutual\nand Countrywide, or tended to have a business model particularly susceptible to runs because\nof dependence on wholesale funding – such as the investment banks Lehman Brothers and\nMerrill Lynch. The loss of capital during this period is striking, and underscores how much\ncapital can be depleted during an unusually severe financial crisis.\nFigure 2 shows the erosion of Tier 1 common equity relative to buffers being used in\nthe Basel III framework. During the stress test exercises associated with the Federal\nReserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Adequacy Review (CCAR) program we have\nrequired that bank capital exceed 5 percent Tier 1 common equity over the forecast horizon,\nbased on the premise that such a buffer would be required for financial firms to fully operate\nand maintain investor and counterparty confidence during stressful periods. Basel III sets the\nminimum Tier 1 common equity plus the conservation buffer at 7 percent. Furthermore,\nunder Basel III, systemically important financial institutions are expected to maintain\nadditional buffers of 1 to 2.5 percentage points. This heightened standard provides capital\nbuffers of 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and 450 basis points above the Tier 1 common\nequity benchmark used during the stress tests.\nFor the 26 large banks examined in the Boston Reserve Bank’s study, half had losses\nbelow the 200 basis point buffer. That is, given the losses experienced during the financial\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\ncrisis, which was quite severe, half of the largest banks – if they held at least 7 percent Tier 1\ncommon equity – would have remained above the 5 percent Tier 1 common ratio during their\nperiod of most severe capital erosion during the crisis. On the other hand, this also highlights\nthat for some banks, such a buffer would not have been sufficient.\nTurning to those financial institutions with the largest capital erosion, eight of the 26\nbanks would have had losses that exceeded 450 basis points. Such losses would have\nexceeded the buffers provided by the currently proposed maximum \"SIFI surcharge\" (for\nsystemically important financial institutions)4 and conservation buffer, and would have caused\ncapital to fall below the 5 percent tier 1 common equity floor that has been used in the CCAR\nstress tests unless banks were holding capital above the regulatory required minimum. This\nhighlights that while the capital buffers should provide significantly greater capital than was\nheld prior to the crisis, the capital buffers do not seem excessive given the losses experienced\nduring the financial crisis at some of our largest institutions.\nWhile such results arguably substantiate the need for relatively large SIFI surcharges,\nhigh capital levels alone are not enough. Our results highlight the need for a multi-pronged\napproach that employs newly-developed supervisory tools – including stress tests, liquidity\nstandards, and resolution plans – in conjunction with capital charges.\n\nII. Improvements in the quality and quantity of capital\nFigure 3 shows how dramatic the improvement in capital ratios has been at large U.S.\nfinancial institutions. For example, the Tier 1 common capital ratio aggregated across 15\nlarge U.S. banking organizations fell to close to 5 percent in late 2008. 5 However, during the\neconomic recovery these institutions have significantly improved their Tier 1 common capital\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nratio, to above 10 percent. The broader definitions of capital show similar strong\nimprovement relative to pre-crisis norms.\nIn addition, Figure 4 highlights that the quality of capital has also significantly\nimproved. Tier 1 common capital accounts for a larger share of total risk-based capital, as\nshown in the top chart. Tangible common equity, a narrow definition of capital shown in the\nbottom chart, has improved significantly since the fourth quarter of 2008. While total capital\nhas improved, the particularly large increase in narrowly defined tangible capital highlights a\nsignificant improvement in loss absorption capacity.\nRelative to the 7 percent minimum for Tier 1 common equity plus the capital\nconservation buffer, banks that are reporting pro forma Basel III capital ratios for the end of\n2012 have already reached this minimum standard, as seen in Figure 5.6 Furthermore, many\nof these large banks are now holding more than 8 percent Tier 1 common equity on a pro\nforma basis.\nFigure 6 compares the pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common equity standard relative to\nthe Tier 1 common equity under Basel I. It shows that the Basel III standard results in a much\nlower – and thus more stringent – capital ratio than the Basel I standard, although the\ndifference can vary greatly depending on the business activities of the financial institution and\nthe quality of assets held. Overall, for those banks disclosing pro forma Basel III capital\nratios, the difference between the Basel III pro forma Tier 1 common equity ratio and the\nBasel I Tier 1 common equity ratio averages more than 2 percent. It is encouraging that many\nlarge U.S. financial institutions have already reached the minimum Basel III Tier 1 common\nequity standard – which is more restrictive than under Basel I, and is set at higher thresholds.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nIII. Capital and Other Regulatory Tools\nIn the United States the new supervisory tools being employed are far more extensive\nthan just raising minimum capital standards. In conjunction with the SIFI surcharges,\nregulators have undertaken several other significant reforms – including liquidity standards,\nstress tests and resolution plans. Examining capital under stress situations, improved liquidity\nstandards, and resolution plans (the so-called “living wills”) are some of the more important\ninnovations that complement the higher capital standards.\nOur results highlight the importance of taking this multi-pronged approach. None of\nthese tools were used before the crisis, and they are likely to be increasingly important tools\nas regulators and financial institutions gain more experience with them. Thus any historical\nexamination of capital erosion may not fully reflect the many changes that have occurred at\nfinancial institutions and in supervision and regulation in recent years.\nIt is also worthwhile considering how the various new supervisory tools could be\ncombined for enhanced impact. For example, one possibility is to make the trade-off between\nhigher capital and the ability to easily resolve large institutions more explicit. One reason for\nimposing a SIFI surcharge is that large, complicated banks are likely to cause problems that\nspill over throughout the financial system (and by extension the economy) if they need to be\nresolved. Smaller banks are usually resolved over a weekend, with most of the assets and\nliabilities transferred to an acquiring bank. However, such a process is not always feasible for\nlarge institutions – as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers.

At this point the\nresolution process is new and untried. However, presumably SIFI surcharges should reflect in\npart how successful resolution plans are likely to be.\nContrary to arguments put forth by some commenters, our results suggest that even\nunder the current multi-pronged approach, the current calibration of the SIFI surcharge does\nnot appear excessive. Given the losses in excess of 450 basis points at a number of large\ninstitutions during the last financial crisis, minimum standards for large institutions may be\ntoo low.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe changes to supervision and regulation since the financial crisis have been\nextensive. Many of those changes are not yet fully implemented, and many of the regulatory\ntools remain untried during times of stress. Nonetheless, U.S. financial institutions are now\nwell placed to finance the economic recovery, as many of the institutions have already\nrecapitalized.\nDespite the dramatic improvement in bank capital positions, examination of capital\nerosion during the financial crisis highlights how large and quick the capital erosion was at\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:15 AM on Monday, February 25, 2013 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n7:15 PM on Sunday, February 24, 2013 U.S. Eastern Time*\n\nsome of the largest financial institutions. While the SIFI surcharges have the potential for\nproviding even more of a capital buffer for the largest institutions, it will be critically\nimportant to determine how other tools such as stress tests, tougher liquidity requirements,\nand resolution plans supplement the higher and more stringent capital standards.\nThe high levels of government support during the financial crisis were problematic.\nGovernment authorities don't want to be in a position of having to provide support again, and\nin fact, might not be able to so. And it is certainly in the industry's best interest not to need\ngovernment support. That makes the enactment of effective capital regimes all the more\nimportant.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nFor a discussion of originate-to-distribute see Board and Santos of the New York Fed at\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/12v18n2/1207bord.pdf\n2\n\nGenerally speaking, the study took starting capital ratio levels which were adjusted to reflect Basel III estimates\nand measured the impact to capital during the financial institution's crisis period resulting from net losses and\nchanges in major regulatory capital accounts, including: goodwill, deferred tax assets, gains/losses resulting from\nown credit risk, and changes in the value of “available for sale” securities.\n3\n\nNote that these crisis periods may differ across institutions given differences in business activities and\naccounting treatment of losses.\n4\n\nFor background see: http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104bb.pdf, notably “ iii)\nRequirements for banks determined to be globally systemically important to have additional loss absorption\ncapacity tailored to the impact of their default, rising from 1% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (with an empty\nbucket of 3.5% to discourage further systemicness), to be met with common equity;…”\n5\n\nFour measures of capital are referenced in Figures 3 and 4, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital,\nTier 1 common capital, and tangible common equity:\nTotal risk-based capital includes core capital elements (Tier 1 capital) plus supplementary capital elements\n(Tier 2 capital).\nTier 1 risk-based capital is defined in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies: RiskBased Measures (12 CFR part 225, Appendix A) as the sum of core capital elements less any amounts of\ngoodwill, other intangible assets, interest-only strips receivables, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity\ninvestments, and other items that are required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix.\nTier 1 capital must represent at least 50 percent of qualifying total capital.” The specific elements included in\nTier 1 capital and their various limits, restrictions, and deductions are discussed in detail in 12 CFR part 225,\nAppendix A.\nTier 2 capital includes supplementary items such as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nComments on the Paper\n“Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role\nof Monetary Policy”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 22, 2013\n\nThe paper “Crunch Time: Fiscal Crises and the Role of Monetary Policy” by\nGreenlaw, Hamilton, Hooper, and Mishkin provides both a theoretical and empirical look\nat the fiscal challenges facing many advanced economies. The first part of the paper\nfocuses on the sustainability of current trends, given the number of countries with high\nlevels of fiscal debt to GDP and serious trade imbalances.\nThe paper makes some observations with which I concur:\n1. That unsustainable fiscal policies need to be made sustainable.\n2. That the “tipping point” for fiscal policies in many developed countries should\nbe an area of concern and continued attention.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n3. That the tipping point can be difficult to precisely determine for individual\ncountries, but the range of debt-to-GDP levels in many advanced economies\nshould make policymakers attentive to imbalances.\nI would like to split my discussion of the paper into two parts. First, I will discuss\nthe authors’ empirical work on tipping points. In that discussion I will emphasize that the\nempirical work is a good first step in analyzing the potential of reaching a tipping point,\nbut that the empirical work would probably benefit from a more extensive examination of\nother factors that influence tipping points.\nIn the second part of my comments today I will discuss the costs and benefits of\nthe large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) program as an instrument of monetary policy.\nWhile remittances – which the authors focus on – are one potential factor worth\nconsidering when estimating the costs of this program, I will suggest that a fuller set of\nbenefits and costs of the program for the economy are needed.\nAs always, I would note that the views I express here today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\nEmpirical work on tipping points\nThe paper provides an empirical model of long-term government bond rates. The\nbasic model estimates the government bond rate as a function of debt to GDP (both net\nand gross), the current account deficit, and time and country dummy variables. This\nmodel is in the spirit of much literature that looks at the probability of a sovereign default\nor tries to empirically estimate sovereign debt default premiums. While much of the\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nearlier literature was focused on problems with sovereign default for less developed\ncountries, this study focuses on the potential for sovereign default premiums to rise in a\nset of advanced economies.\nFrom this rather parsimonious model the authors draw a number of conclusions.\nIn particular, that at the level of current account deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios currently\nexperienced in many advanced economies, the risk of rising sovereign default premiums\nis quite high. Furthermore, if unaddressed, these premiums could reach a tipping point\nthat becomes unsustainable.\nWhile this degree of parsimoniousness in a model can be a virtue, I would suggest\nthat if there are important omitted variables from the empirical work then the coefficient\nestimates can be biased, and the effects attributed to the variables in the model can be a\nproxy for effects that are really driven by movements in the omitted variables. Because\nthe model includes both dummy variables for countries and time, the omitted variables\nwould need to be variables that could drive long-term rates that vary over time and by\ncountry. How likely is that to be the case with this simple regression?\nConsider the example of Ireland. Figure 1 shows that in 2006 Ireland had a very\nlow debt-to-GDP ratio. In fact, debt to GDP was substantially lower than that of the\nU.S., U.K., and France. The current account deficit was better than that of the United\nStates, similar to that of the U.K., and somewhat worse than that of France. Despite this\nrelatively sanguine situation in 2006, Ireland was close to the tipping point. Debt to GDP\nwas about to rise quickly, as seen in Figure 2, and Ireland was about to lose the ability to\nissue long-term debt.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe problem in Ireland was that while fiscal debt was well controlled, the country\nwas facing a serious financial stability problem. So, what type of financial stability\nvariables might capture the impending tipping point in a way that is not captured by the\nsimple empirical model?\nOne example of a potentially important omitted variable is the financial strength\nof the banking sector. For example, non-performing assets of the banking sector relative\nto GDP would capture the impact of building banking pressures. In Ireland, banking\nproblems rather than fiscal problems were an important driver in hitting the tipping point.\nAnother variable that varies over time and by country would be the percentage change in\nreal estate prices or possibly the difference between the return on owning and the return\non renting. These types of variables would try to capture the growing risk of bubbles in\nIreland and Spain.\nA second set of potential omitted variables relates to the political determinants of\nrisk premiums. One frequently sees that credit default rates spike around elections, and\nthat countries that are politically destabilized have difficulty generating the political will\nto address problems – particularly if public opinion is as fragmented as the political\nprocess. This might be captured by how frequently national elections were held over the\npast four years, or by other political variables capturing the difficulty in obtaining a stable\nmajority political party in some countries at some times.\nAnother political variable that might be relevant is a variable that captures\nwhether there is stable fiscal federalism in a country. For example in Spain, debt and\nbanking problems have been exacerbated by the reality of regions that were autonomous\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbut not necessarily fiscally responsible. A variable that might capture this impact is state\nand local government debt to GDP.\nA third set of potential omitted variables would reflect labor market conditions.\nWith a currency union, persistent differences in competitiveness can push countries to the\ntipping point. Measures of labor market productivity might capture this impact, which\nmay vary over countries and over time. Another potential important variable would be\ndifferences in unfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP. Countries with growing\nunfunded pension liabilities relative to GDP may need to eventually raise government\ndebt to fund these liabilities, pushing a country to the tipping point.\nA variety of other potential omitted variables could be explored. Credit default\nswap rates tend to move as countries approach high rollover periods. A debt\nmanagement variable might capture this rollover risk by looking at short-term debt\nrelative to GDP. And demographic variables may also be relevant. Countries with fastgrowing, well-educated populations may be less at risk of tipping points than countries\nwith declining populations that are not well educated.\nWhile this is not an exhaustive list of omitted variables, it does highlight that such\na pared-down model may ignore important drivers of tipping points. In addition, one\ncannot be sure that the coefficients used in simulations might not change significantly\nwith a more richly specified model.\nWhile this paper provides a good discussion of tipping points, the coefficients and\nsimulations should be viewed as indicative of a more general point – that policymakers\nshould consider how a variety of public policies, including fiscal policies, can influence\ntipping points.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nBenefits and Costs of LSAPS\nThe final section of the paper discusses the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet. It highlights a potential problem – that if monetary policy is successful in\nreturning us quickly to full employment, or if interest rates rise for other reasons such as\nreaching a tipping point, remittances to the Treasury would be impacted. The baseline\nscenario the authors provide reflects gains overall for the LSAP, but under the authors’\nmost pessimistic scenarios significant losses are generated.\nUnfortunately, this discussion does not do justice to the policy trade-offs, in my\nopinion. To take them into account, ideally one would do a more complete comparison\nof how the economy and fiscal policy would evolve with and without large-scale asset\npurchase (LSAP) programs in place.\nThe purpose of the LSAP is to reduce long-term interest rates to stimulate the\neconomy. Analysis of the LSAP program requires looking at more than remittances.\nIdeally one would start with how well policy – with and without LSAPs – fulfills the\nFederal Reserve’s dual mandate, provided by Congress. Even if one wanted to focus on\nthe more narrow fiscal impact, I believe one would need a much fuller analysis.\nAnd to capture the benefits of the LSAP you need a fuller model. One of the\nmodels currently used by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston provides a relatively\nconservative estimate of the economic benefits of a hypothetical additional $750 billion\nLSAP. Based on historical experience, the model implies that such a purchase would\nlower long-term rates by 20 to 25 basis points, relative to not making the additional\npurchases. The impact of this large a reduction in long-term rates is a cumulative gain in\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreal GDP, relative to the base, of 1.6 percent or $260 billion. In our model such a\npurchase also results in a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.25 percent or 400,000\njobs. Some of the models we run provide a larger impact to such purchases.\nNonetheless, such estimation provides a baseline for considering the economic\nbenefits of additional purchases. These estimates are subject to a considerable degree of\nuncertainty, and the impact could easily be higher or lower than that implied by our\nmodel. However, based on our statistical work using historical data, we believe these are\nreasonable estimates of the benefits.\nEven if one wanted to focus on the fiscal impact of the LSAP program, I would\nsuggest that the impact goes beyond remittances provided to the Treasury. The first\neffect would be to examine the path of interest rates on government debt with and\nwithout the LSAP program. Since the LSAP reduces interest rates, such a simulation\nwould show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced by the lowered cost of financing fiscal\ndeficits as a result of the LSAP program.\nThe second fiscal impact would be from faster economic growth. Faster\neconomic growth produces more tax revenue and, by reducing unemployment, reduces\ngovernment entitlement expenditures on programs such as unemployment insurance.\nThus, LSAPs actually produce a much more positive fiscal impact than the authors\nsuggest.\nMoreover, the evaluation of the program needs to include the contributions of\nLSAPs to achieving the goals of the dual mandate for U.S. monetary policy. We\ncurrently have an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent in the country and PCE inflation of\n1.3 percent. Had we not undertaken LSAP policies, we would be even further away from\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nachieving each element of our dual mandate, with an unemployment rate higher and an\ninflation rate lower than we currently have (assuming we have been successful in\nimproving the economy).\nAs Figure 3 shows, loan rates on mortgages and autos have declined since the\nzero lower bound for the federal funds rate was hit, and home and auto sales have been\nimproving. These interest-sensitive sectors have been among the fastest growing\ncomponents of real GDP over the past year. Some of this improvement is the result of\nour LSAP policies.\nFinally, extended periods of unemployment may have long-run costs that have\nboth fiscal and broader economic impacts. If an extended period of high unemployment\ncauses more workers to drop out of the labor force and places many new workers on a\npermanently lower income growth path – as many studies have shown – then failing to\nundertake LSAPs can have much broader impacts on fiscal and economic policies.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe authors of this paper have provided a useful contribution to the literature by\nhighlighting the impact of not considering fiscal tipping points. As their work highlights,\nhitting fiscal tipping points can have dire consequences for all citizens – and predicting\nwhen such a tipping point will be hit is difficult. As a result, fiscal and monetary\npolicymakers need to be mindful of the potential of their actions to impact tipping points.\nBut I hope my discussion today has highlighted that, with respect to monetary\npolicy, the LSAP program improves the broader fiscal outlook by lowering interest rates\nand providing more economic growth. In addition, it returns the economy to full\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, February 22, 2013 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nemployment and an inflation rate at the 2 percent target more quickly than would have\noccurred in the absence of such actions. We do well to also consider these benefits, and\nthe costs of inaction, when evaluating policy.\nThank you.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGreater Providence Chamber of\nCommerce Policy Forum\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nJanuary 15, 2013\n\nI appreciate having been invited to speak again to the Providence Chamber of Commerce.\nAs all of you know, Rhode Island was one of the states most severely impacted by the recession,\nand it remains one of the hardest-hit states even at this point in the economic recovery. Rhode\nIsland is one of only two states that as of November continued to have a state unemployment rate\nin excess of 10 percent.\nPersistently high unemployment rates have enormous personal and societal costs. So in\nmy view it is critical that public policy continues to actively support the economy’s return to full\nemployment.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nToday I would like to highlight that the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy\nhas played an important role in the recovery we have seen to date. And I would like to explain\nwhy I consider it imperative that monetary policy continue to actively support the economy at\npresent – since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same\ntime, inflation is undershooting the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target.1\nAs always, I would note that my remarks encompass my own views, not necessarily those\nof my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\n\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy has grown at an average 2.2 percent annual rate since the recovery\nofficially began in June of 2009. Data suggest that growth was likely a bit below that rate for the\nmost recent quarter, and the employment report for December showed that the national economy\ncontinues to only gradually improve. Given that many businesses and households were deferring\ndecisions until there was more clarity on the fiscal outlook, the emerging picture of the fourth\nquarter (stemming from sources such as the employment report) is encouraging. The national\nfiscal uncertainty cast a shadow on the economy, but it seems there have been some signs of\nunderlying strength.\nI consider it particularly encouraging that some interest-sensitive sectors, which are likely\nto be especially responsive to monetary stimulus, are clearly showing themselves to be “on the\nmend.” Both the housing sector and purchases of consumer durables have been recovering, in\npart as a response to the accommodative monetary policy the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nUnfortunately, recent economic improvements have been partially offset by the deferral\nof spending decisions by households and firms. In all likelihood, these deferrals result in part\nfrom uncertainty over national fiscal policy, as well as from the impact of fiscal austerity that has\nalready taken place – particularly at the state and local government levels. If some of the\n“headwinds” from fiscal austerity discussions here and in Europe abate, we should begin to see\ngrowth come in at a pace that is above the economy’s long-run potential growth rate. Such\ngrowth would bring about both economic expansion and improvements in labor markets.\n\nInterest sensitive sectors are responding to monetary policy\nThe sectors of the economy that are showing the most improvement recently are those\nthat economists generally consider to be the most responsive to monetary policy and interest\nrates. Particularly notable is the improvement in the outlook for the housing market. Figure 1\nshows growth in real residential investment compared to growth in real GDP. Over the past year\nreal GDP growth has averaged 2.6 percent. In contrast, growth in residential investment\noccurred at much higher rates, and I expect this positive momentum to continue through 2013.\nFigure 2 provides the rationale for my optimism about residential investment. Housing\nprices in many parts of the country have begun to rise, and although it is not broken out on the\nchart, this includes prices in some of the areas that were hardest hit by declines in housing prices.\nIn addition, mortgage rates remain near their cyclical lows and well below the average mortgage\nrate experienced over the past 25 years. With prices edging up and interest rates at historic\nlows, there is now something of an incentive for a potential home buyer to actively pursue\nbuying a home. This is the case because both mortgage rates and house prices could be higher if\npotential buyers delay their purchase decisions.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nThis current dynamic substantially improves the outlook for housing in my view, together\nwith the fact that houses have become more affordable. The ratio of house prices to rents – a\nsummary measure of the cost of owning versus renting – has fallen back to traditional levels after\nrising to significant heights during the housing bubble. Finally, in the wake of the financial crisis\nand recession, many people postponed creating new households as they sought to improve their\nfinancial position. But there has been an improvement in household formation recently and\nmany of these new households will be potential home buyers.\nFigure 3 shows that consumer-durable purchases have also increased, in part as a result\nof the very low interest rate environment. Consumer-durable purchases have been a source of\nstrength over the past year, and have grown much more quickly than real GDP. I expect\nconsumer-durable purchases to continue to be a source of strength over 2013.\nOne particular area of rapid growth has been new car purchases (Figure 4). Recent\npurchases may have something to do with the fact that the average age of cars on the road is now\n11.1 years.2 Some potential car buyers surely postponed decisions until the economic outlook\nwas clearer. So we are seeing a need to replace some aging cars, along with particularly\nattractive terms available because of the low interest rate environment. The result was purchases\nof cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of well over 15 million in November\nand December. However, a potential concern is that the payroll tax increases that were part of\nthe recent tax agreement will impact the real disposable income of potential buyers. Partially\noffsetting this had been the lower average gas prices in the fourth quarter, although they have\nrisen somewhat, recently.\nSo overall, I see monetary policy having an impact, in encouraging the purchase of\ninterest-sensitive assets like homes, cars, and consumer durables. The most interest-sensitive\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsectors have been responding to the monetary stimulus from the Fed, and this stimulus has\nprovided a major source of strength for the economy last year. And it is likely to be a source of\nsupport in 2013.\nUnfortunately, the strength in interest-sensitive sectors is partially offset by weakness in\nother areas of the economy. In particular, while the country certainly needs to get to a\nsustainable long-term fiscal path, the direct and indirect impacts of recent fiscal austerity\ndeliberations have in my view been one reason that the economy has not snapped back more\nquickly.\n\nFiscal policy, policy uncertainty, and Europe remain potential constraints\nIndeed, a major source of economic weakness during the recovery has been the need for\nstate and local governments to cut budgets.3 Whatever your views on the political economy of\ngovernment spending, in the short term fiscal austerity removes spending from the economy. In\nmany cases this drop in public spending increases unemployment as teachers, police, and other\nworkers are laid off.\nIn part due to the weakness in housing that strained state and local government finances,\nstate and local government spending has been a large drag on the economy. This spending\naccounts for close to 12 percent of the goods and services purchased in the economy.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, while state and local government spending remained a drag in\nlate 2011 and the first half of last year, there was actually a slight increase in real state and local\ngovernment spending in the third quarter of last year. Many expect that state and local spending\nwill increase modestly this year, too. Federal spending has been more volatile, but generally has\nbeen a source of weakness as a component of economic activity as well.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSince federal spending accounts for roughly 8 percent of the goods and services\npurchased in the economy, this is a major source of uncertainty for 2013. Given the large fiscal\ndeficits still being run, the process by which the nation can reach a more sustainable long-term\nfiscal policy remains rather uncertain. What does seem certain is that there will be cuts in\ngovernment spending which, like higher taxes, will by the simple math of the GDP calculation\nslow down overall economic growth.\nThere is substantial uncertainty over the fate of federal government grants to state and\nlocal governments.4 Substantial cutbacks in these grants would have a ripple effect on the\neconomy. Similarly, there is the issue of potential federal tax base broadening in order to reduce\nthe federal budget deficit. This will have implications for business and family budgets.\nWhile the need for long-run sustainable fiscal policy is both clear and uncontroversial, I\nbelieve it is important to achieve sustainability in a way that does not risk the tentative economic\nimprovements we have experienced to date.\nOne area that has probably been impacted by the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy\nhas been business investment, shown in Figure 6. Nationally, business investment had been a\nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, but capital spending by firms weakened\nsignificantly in the third quarter of last year – as many firms sought more clarity on government\ntax and spending decisions before committing to long-term investments. Fiscal uncertainty\ntherefore accounts for at least some share of the recent weakness in business spending, and\nunfortunately this potential cause for weakness in business spending is likely to persist this year.\nA third source of weakness remains the weak outlook for many of our trading partners, as\nshown in Figure 7. Both Japan and Europe have grown more slowly than the United States.\nAdditionally, Japan still struggles with a serious deflation problem, and Europe continues to\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\naddress fiscal imbalances in many of its peripheral countries. Both regions are also experiencing\naging populations, demographically speaking, which brings some difficult fiscal and economic\nchallenges.\nDespite these headwinds at home and abroad, I do expect improvement in U.S. economic\ngrowth this year. While in the first half of 2013 I think the economy is likely to grow at roughly\nits potential level of growth, I expect growth in the second half of the year to be closer to 3\npercent – assuming that headwinds from fiscal imbalances around the world are not resolved in\neconomically disruptive ways.\n\nBoth inflation and unemployment remain far from long-run FOMC estimates\nFigure 8 shows the U.S. inflation experience since 2003. While many critics of\nmonetary policy have been concerned with inflationary pressures, through most of the recovery\ncore PCE inflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Notably, despite\nthe rapid growth of the central bank’s balance sheet in 2008, as well as the balance sheet’s\ncontinued growth more recently, there has been no upward trend in inflation. Total PCE\ninflation is only 1.4 percent over the past year and core PCE inflation is at 1.5 percent.\nSo current inflation is well below the Fed’s target, and expected inflation5 is well below\nlevels that the FOMC has stated would generate a discussion of lifting short-term rates.6 Being\nmore than half a percent below our target for PCE inflation highlights why I believe aggressive\nmonetary policy remains appropriate, given that the 7.8 percent unemployment rate is well above\nwhere the FOMC expects the unemployment rate to settle in the longer run.\nThe national unemployment rate has fallen during the recovery, as shown in Figure 9,\nand in fact payroll employment growth has averaged 151,000 jobs over the past three months.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nNonetheless, the societal costs to elevated unemployment rates that are falling only slowly show\nwhy accommodative monetary policy is both appropriate and needed.\nFigure 10 shows employment in the construction and consumer durable sectors as a\nshare of the U.S. labor force. By our calculation, if construction employment returned to its\n2004 levels and durable goods manufacturing regained half of the jobs lost since 2004, the\nunemployment rate would be 6.5 percent (meaning an additional 2.1 million people would be\nemployed).7\nWhile interest-sensitive sectors are one of the areas of growth, a more rapid return to the\nmore normal employment shares for those sectors would significantly improve job prospects for\nworkers that have been unemployed or underemployed. Construction and durable goods are both\nindustries that have provided employment opportunities for some with less educational\nattainment, an area of particularly elevated unemployment rates (as shown in Figure 11). A\nfaster recovery in construction and durable goods would help re-employ those working in sectors\nof the economy that have suffered greatly during the recession and the painfully slow recovery.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion I would just reiterate my view that continued monetary accommodation is\nabsolutely appropriate and indeed needed as long as we are projected to miss on both elements of\nthe Fed’s dual mandate, inflation and employment. Currently inflation is somewhat below our 2\npercent target, and unemployment is well above a longer-run sustainable rate.\nAs the recent FOMC statement highlighted, monetary policy should be guided by current\nand future economic outcomes, not calendar dates. Interest-sensitive sectors have been\nresponding to accommodative policy, and we should all continue to encourage a quicker\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, January 15, 2013 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nrecovery in those sectors. If we were able to see construction and durable-goods production\nreturn to a more normalized share of the workforce, it would have a meaningful impact on\npotential employees in those interest-sensitive sectors and also on the broader national labor\nmarkets.\nAgain I thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. And particularly in light of\nthe challenges Rhode Island has encountered in recent years, I wish you all an improved year in\n2013.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAs measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE.\n\n2\n\nAs of July 2011.\n\n3\n\nA new report from the Rockefeller Institute presents information on \"unprecedented\" cuts in state-local\ngovernment employment [http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/government_finance/2013-01-09-StateLocal_Government_Employment.pdf]. The report notes that reductions in state and local government employment\nbetween August 2008 and November 2012 in Rhode Island were second largest of all the states in percentage terms\n(see Table 4 of the report). Connecticut and Vermont were also in the top 10 in this regard.\n\n4\n\nThe Pew Center on the States calculates that the federal grants subject to sequestration amount to about 6.5 percent\nof state government revenues nationwide.\n5\n\nThe statement refers to a situation where “…inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more\nthan a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation\nexpectations continue to be well anchored.”\n\n6\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm\n\n7\n\nThis considers that there is a secular decline in durable-goods manufacturing. If durable goods employment\nreturned to its 2004 levels as well, the unemployment rate would fall further, to 6.0 percent.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nKeynote remarks at\n“The Spread between Primary and Secondary\nMortgage Rates: Recent Trends and Prospects”\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks\nof Boston and New York\nNew York, New York\nDecember 3, 2012\n\nIt is a pleasure to be in New York to be part of this important discussion of recent\ndevelopments in the residential mortgage market. I would like to offer special thanks to\nthe staff at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, many of whom are still dealing with the\nconsequences of Hurricane Sandy. My brother lives in Northern New Jersey and like so\nmany others he experienced significant structural damage to his house. I know many at\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthis Bank and across the region have similar and, unfortunately, even more tragic stories\nresulting from the storm.\nAs awful as the storm was, it brought out the remarkable resilience of the Greater\nNew York area. Much progress has been made, though there certainly remains much to\nbe done for homeowners and businesses in affected areas.\nThis conference is focused on the spread between longer-term interest rates\nprevailing in the marketplace and the rates consumers pay on mortgages. This is an\nimportant topic, given that one of the more important monetary policy initiatives since\nshort-term interest rates reached the zero lower bound has been the purchase of longerterm assets, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These policies seem to be\nhaving the desired effect as the Federal Reserve’s two announcements of asset-purchase\nprograms focused on MBS immediately generated significant declines in the yields on\nsuch securities (on MBS).\nOf course I want to begin as I do all my talks with the reminder that the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nJust how these asset purchase programs actually influence the rates paid by\nhomeowners is complicated by a variety of institutional factors. These include the\nmarket structure of mortgage lenders, the cyclical nature of refinance activity, changes in\nthe credit profile of borrowers, changes in the role of government-sponsored enterprises\n(GSEs) in the mortgage market, and expectations of future interest rate changes that\nimpact the likelihood of refinancing activity. The pass-through of Federal Reserve assetpurchase programs can be influenced by changes in any of these factors, and at times\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nchanges in these factors can provide headwinds or tailwinds impacting the efficacy of the\npolicies.\nAs a result, this is a particularly fruitful time for research in this area, with an eye\nto policy – as research presented today suggests.1 And I hope the development of further\nresearch agendas around these issues will be one result of this conference.\nStill, while we have much to learn about mortgage market developments, and how\nlarge-scale central bank asset purchases pass through to mortgage lending, I want to state\nvery plainly that I believe the monetary policies designed to lower mortgage rates and\nstimulate more activity in interest-sensitive sectors have been effective, and are an\nimportant reason why the U.S. economy has performed better than many of our\ndeveloped-country peers. Work being done at both the Boston and New York Reserve\nbanks has shown that the pass-through of these Fed actions to consumers, appropriately\nmeasured, has been quite large. This type of empirical work is important as both an\nacademic inquiry and a policy-relevant finding.\nConsider that many businesses have reported putting their plans on hold given\nuncertainties around fiscal policy here and in Europe, yet household spending has\ncontinued and housing-related activity has picked up – despite the uncertain environment.\nGiven the tepid economic recovery, high unemployment, and subdued inflation –\nand the uncertainty around fiscal policy – I believe an accommodative monetary policy is\nquite appropriate. We want to see continued improvement in labor markets in the near\nterm, and monetary policy should encourage faster economic growth to achieve that\nobjective.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nSo in my view, a strong case can be made for the Federal Reserve continuing to\npurchase the current $85 billion in longer-term securities a month – even after our socalled “Operation Twist” maturity-extension program2 (a portion of those purchases) is\ncompleted at the end of 2012. This is a topic we will be discussing at the next FOMC\nmeeting.3\n\nChanges in the Composition of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nAs a result of reaching the zero lower bound for short-term interest rates during\nthe financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has engaged in more forward guidance for\nmonetary policy, as well as undertaking large-scale asset purchases. Both are designed to\nflatten the yield curve, with the intention of encouraging additional longer-term\nborrowing – and indeed auto loan rates and mortgage rates are well below their averages\nthrough the business cycle. Today I will discuss the large-scale asset-purchase program.\nMany have focused on the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but it is\nequally important to consider the changes in the composition of the balance sheet.\nParticularly notable is the movement to longer-duration Treasury securities and to\nmortgage-backed securities. Keep in mind, however, that this change in the composition\nof assets has not increased the credit risk taken by the Federal Reserve, as open market\noperations are limited to assets with government guarantees.\nFigure 1 shows the assets held by the Federal Reserve in December 2007 and\nthen at the end of November 2012. The balance sheet changed from under $1 trillion at\nthe end of 2007 to close to $3 trillion in 2012. Equally striking has been the change in\nthe composition of Federal Reserve assets. At the end of 2007, nearly two-thirds of the\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nassets were shorter-term (maturing in 5 years or less) Treasury securities and almost onehalf of the securities had a maturity of less than one year. By 2012, the composition had\nchanged. As a result of Operation Twist, the balance sheet has become more heavily\nweighted toward long-duration Treasury securities. In addition, the balance sheet now\nalso includes approximately $880 billion in mortgage-backed securities maturing in more\nthan 10 years.\nFigure 2 provides the same information, but shows how the asset mix has\nchanged over time. The initial expansion of the balance sheet was the result of our\ncrisis-related emergency lending programs. As those emergency programs were wound\ndown, asset purchases resulted in a significant expansion of long-duration Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities. More recently, Operation Twist has resulted in our selling\nthe shorter-term Treasury securities so that most of the securities on the balance sheet are\nmortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities with more than five years to maturity.\n\nConsidering a Reserves-Focused Monetary Policy\nSome observers have advocated for maintaining a short-duration Treasury\nportfolio – arguing that monetary policy would be sufficiently expansionary by adding\nbank reserves, and thus there was no need to extend the duration of assets. In this view,\nsince policy primarily works through bank reserves, purchasing assets that minimized\nrisks – including interest-rate risk – to the Federal Reserve would be preferred. Shortterm Treasury securities have no credit risk and also would carry minimal interest rate\nrisk. Furthermore, in this view another benefit is that the balance sheet could quickly\nshrink by not replacing the short-term securities as they mature.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nBut in my view a reserves-focused monetary policy poses several problems. First,\nthere is little impact on market interest rates, since exchanging Treasury bills that carry a\nlow interest rate for bank reserves that carry a low interest rate will have little in the way\nof interest rate effects. Furthermore, the banking sector would be forced to hold more\nlow-interest reserves at a time when capital is scarce and many banks are seeking to\nshrink rather than expand their own balance sheet. Thus, when interest rates are already\nat the zero lower bound, a short-maturity reserves-focused policy will not have much\nimpact on inflation or employment.\nIn fact, Figure 3 shows that a rapid increase in excess reserves in both the United\nStates and Japan appears to have had little effect on inflation in both countries. While\ninflation in the United States has been close to 2 percent, Japan has continued to have a\nproblem with deflation, despite significant increases in excess reserves.\nFurthermore, the increase in bank reserves has not caused a large increase in bank\nlending, as shown in Figure 4. In Japan, real bank loans are still below where they were\ntwo decades ago. In the United States, despite some growth recently, real bank lending\nremains below levels attained prior to the recession. It is noteworthy that in Japan, policy\nhas generally leaned toward a significant amount of shorter-duration securities – although\nmore recently there have been greater purchases of longer-duration assets.\n\nSpread-Focused Monetary Policy\nIn contrast to reserves-focused monetary policy, spread-focused monetary policy\nseeks to lower the cost of funds to households and firms by purchasing longer-duration\nassets. This policy, like the purchase of short-term Treasury securities, increases\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nreserves. However, the transmission mechanism is not primarily through excess reserves,\nbut rather focuses on altering the cost of longer-term borrowing.\nCentral bank purchases of long-term Treasury securities flatten the yield curve\nand cause other medium- and long-term rates, including those on autos and houses, to\ndecline. Similarly, the purchase of mortgage-backed securities causes rates to decline for\nMBS but also for other longer-duration assets. By reducing the borrowing cost of these\npurchases, demand for cars and houses should be stimulated. By altering interest rates\nfaced by firms and households, as well as expanding the amount of reserves, the\ntransmission of monetary policy is likely to be much more effective given that the\neconomy has already reached the lower bound for short-term interest rates.\nAdmittedly, spread-focused monetary policy carries some risk for a country’s\nmonetary authority. Because the duration of assets is much longer, the balance sheet will\nnot automatically shrink as rapidly when purchases are discontinued. Furthermore, if the\nplan is fully effective and quickly restores the economy to more normal financial\nconditions – including higher market interest rates – then the market value of the central\nbank’s portfolio of low-yielding securities will inevitably decrease.\n\nPotential Advantages of Large-Scale MBS Purchases\nBoth long-term Treasury securities and mortgage rates have continued to fall as\nthe Federal Reserve has purchased longer-term securities,4 as Figure 5 highlights.\nA common way of describing the mechanism through which the central bank’s\npurchase of longer-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities affects\ninterest rates is that such purchases “remove duration” from the marketplace – driving up\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nprices for assets with longer duration and thus pushing down yields, and resulting in a\nreduction in longer-term rates generally. This view takes MBS and Treasuries to be\nfairly close substitutes, and assumes that duration is the most important attribute that\ninvestors seek in choosing among investment alternatives. Since the mortgage-backed\nsecurities purchased have government guarantees, both Treasury securities and mortgagebacked securities do not have default risk.\nDespite these similarities, however, there may be several reasons for a central\nbank to prefer large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Some of these\nreasons involve loosening the assumption that assets are close substitutes and that\nduration is the key channel through which central bank purchases have effects.\nFirst, mortgage rates may be more responsive to a purchase of MBS than\npurchases of similar amounts of Treasury securities if mortgages are less-than-perfect\nsubstitutes for Treasuries, in part because investors have quite specific preferences for\nmortgage securities – what financial economists call “market segmentation.” Under\nmarket segmentation – which is consistent with the fact that the spread between Treasury\nand MBS securities varies over time rather than remaining constant – purchases of MBS\nmay have a larger impact on mortgage rates than purchases of Treasury securities.\nParticularly at a time when housing prices are beginning to rise in many markets, making\nmortgage rates attractive may encourage potential home buyers to not delay their\npurchase decision.\nSecond, the ability to refinance mortgages with no prepayment penalty makes the\nsecurities quite different from Treasury securities in several respects – perhaps one of the\nkey reasons that investors see them as imperfect substitutes. From the perspective of a\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncentral bank purchasing the securities, many mortgages will be repaid early (before\nmaturity) even if interest rates rise. Individuals move for a variety of reasons including\nchanges in employment, a need to purchase a larger home, or a desire to downsize once\nchildren leave the home. As a result, while many people may take on a 30-year\nmortgage, most people will retire the mortgage well before its 30-year maturity.\nTo that end, Figure 6 provides the percent of homeowners that have been in their\nhomes for at least 10 or 20 years, in 2000 and in 2010. Over both horizons, roughly half\nthe homeowners had been in their homes for at least 10 years, and roughly one-quarter\nhad been in their homes for at least 20 years. Thus, even if rates were to rise, a\nsignificant percentage of mortgages would likely retire, providing a much shorter\nduration than for longer-term Treasury securities of a similar maturity.5, 6\nHowever, the downside of being able to retire the mortgage without prepayment\npenalty is that the pass-through of lower mortgage costs from the investor to the\nhomeowner can be less than one-for-one. Changes in the propensity to retire mortgages\nwill influence the price of mortgages, and the extent to which a lower wholesale\nmortgage rate will be passed through to borrowers. This may be particularly true for\nhigh-rate mortgages that reflect the desire to avoid paying points or closing costs, or that\nreflect the credit worthiness of the borrower – since both may reflect a higher propensity\nto retire the mortgage should circumstances change.\nThird, Treasury markets are highly liquid, so that the liquidity premium is still\nrelatively small for seasoned issues. As a result, Treasury securities are often preferred\nduring times of crises because investors can easily exit their positions should they need to\nraise funds. The mortgage-backed securities market is less liquid, particularly for\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nseasoned issues. Thus during times of stress, the functioning of the mortgage market\nmay be impaired, providing an opportunity for a central bank purchase program to\nimprove market functioning as well as change the relative price of securities by\nintroducing a new large-scale buyer. The crisis events of 2008 provide an example.\nFinally, there may be capacity constraints in only buying MBS securities or only\nbuying Treasury securities. Because of potential capacity constraints and the fact that the\ndegree of substitutability may be situational, a strong case can be made for purchasing\nboth MBS and Treasury securities – with the proportions depending on the\ncircumstances.\nThus if the purpose is to improve market functioning, or to provide focused\nstimulus to an interest-sensitive sector in order to stimulate aggregate demand, it may be\nthat MBS purchases are preferable to Treasury security purchases.7\nAlso, even though the impact on mortgage markets may be particularly favorable\nat certain times, MBS purchases are likely to have an impact beyond the mortgage\nmarket. Figure 7 shows that mortgage rates have fallen during large asset purchase\nprograms, but Figure 8 shows that corporate rates also have declined, and Figure 9\nshows that prices on assets such as stocks have generally risen during this time period,\ndespite significant economic uncertainty.\nHence, given the effectiveness of this policy and the relatively high\nunemployment rate and inflation8 that is running below our 2 percent target, I fully\nsupport the policy decisions to provide stimulus through asset purchases – and I believe\nthat including MBS purchases in the first and third asset-purchase programs have\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncontributed to a stronger economic outcome than we would have seen in the absence of\nthese approaches.\nWhile asset prices do seem to have been affected by the purchase programs, the\nultimate goal is to stimulate further economic growth. Thus it is heartening that despite\nthe economic uncertainties, households seem more confident in the economic future and\nare again purchasing long-term assets such as houses. As Figure 10 shows, housing\nstarts have been increasing, as have housing prices in many markets. Accommodative\nmonetary policy has provided an important support to an economy still suffering from the\nimpact of the financial crisis and the continued fiscal uncertainty here and abroad.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that many factors influence the passthrough of monetary policy to interest rates and output. This conference is highlighting\nmany of the challenges to obtaining a full pass through to the mortgage rates faced by\nhouseholds. Nonetheless, long-term rates – including mortgage rates – do appear to have\nreacted to actions undertaken by the Fed.\nI hope that as a result of the work of those at this conference, we can achieve an\neven better appreciation for additional steps that could be taken so that more households\ncan benefit from stimulative monetary policy designed to encourage faster economic\ngrowth.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 3, 2012 at 12:45 P.M.

In the absence of those\npurchases, the amount of long-duration securities that the Fed would be buying each month would decline\nto $40 billion.\n\n4\n\nOf course, some of this decline is because the economy continued to disappoint.\n\n5\n\nIn addition, the mortgages backing an MBS amortize, shortening the duration of MBS’s relative to same\nmaturity Treasuries. So MBS’s should be expected to roll off the Fed's balance sheet faster than Treasuries,\nboth due to amortization and due to prepayments. Still, prepayments from refinancing activity would\ndecline in a rising interest rate environment, thus increasing the MBS's duration other things equal. Such\nan effect partially offsets the benefits of holding MBS’s deriving from amortization and from prepayments\nnot related to refinancing activity.\n6\n\nHomeowners with low interest rates can rent out their homes if they are forced to move by a job change or\nother life event. Obviously, only a small fraction of owners are likely to do this, because of the challenges\nof managing a property after a move to a new area. But there are companies that will manage properties for\nabsentee owners, and rising interest rates may dissuade some owners from moving in the first place.\n7\n\nA counterargument some may make is that Treasury purchases may have broader impacts on many\nsomewhat similar securities — including mortgages.\n8\n\nPersonal Consumption Expenditure or PCE.\n\n12\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBabson College’s\nStephen D. Cutler Center\nfor Investments and Finance\nWellesley, Massachusetts\nNovember 1, 2012\n\nI’m very pleased to be with you today at Babson, a school known for doing a\ngreat job of preparing graduates to face the challenges of the economic landscape.\nRegardless of your area of concentration at Babson, the outlook for the economy is\nrelevant to your studies and, of course, your pursuit of future employment.\nThis year and last, we all experienced real-life frights around Halloween, thanks\nto severe and unusual storms. I’m happy that Hurricane Sandy did not prevent us from\ngetting together today at Babson, but I know our thoughts are with those in our region\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand down the Eastern Seaboard who were so significantly affected by the storm – and\nwho continue the clean-up and recovery process.\nToday I plan to highlight three main points about the economic outlook. I always\nlike to emphasize that my remarks represent my views, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Board of Governors.\nA first point is this: while it is still early to gauge the full impact of the Federal\nReserve’s September monetary policy committee decision to begin an open-ended\nmortgage-backed security purchase program,1 the program has so far worked as expected.\nThe initial response in financial markets was larger than many expected. Given that our\nconventional monetary tool, the fed funds rate, has hit its lower bound of zero, we have\nturned to unconventional monetary policy. By that I mean policy that attempts to affect\nlong-term interest rates directly, via asset purchases,2 rather than indirectly by setting the\nshort-term interest rate, as in conventional policy.\nUnconventional policy has affected financial markets much like movements of\nconventional policy would have. Our use of unconventional policy tools has led to lower\nlonger-term interest rates; higher equity prices; and, in a peripheral by-product of lower\nU.S. rates, exchange-rate effects.\nBy further easing financial conditions, the Fed’s actions appear to be providing\nadditional stimulus to the household sector – as witnessed recently by higher consumer\nconfidence, and increases in purchases of interest-sensitive items such as new homes and\ncars. Certainly, concerns about such issues as the looming “fiscal cliff” in the U.S. and\nslow growth in many developed countries do appear to be depressing business spending.\nStill, our actions are likely to spur faster economic growth than we would have had\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwithout this additional stimulus – and, as you know, economic growth has been painfully\nslow.\nMy second point is that the increased quantity of bank reserves that resulted from\nthese unconventional monetary policy actions have not resulted in inflation above our 2\npercent target. If you look over a longer period such as from 2000 to the present, total\nPCE3 inflation has averaged 2.2 percent and core PCE inflation4 has averaged 1.9 percent\n– in either case very close to the 2 percent target announced at the beginning of this year.\nThe fact that we continue to undershoot our inflation target while unemployment remains\nhigh is, in my view, a very strong rationale for maintaining a highly accommodative\nstance for monetary policy.\nMy third point is that in addition to stable prices, the Federal Reserve is charged\nwith attaining maximum sustainable employment – what we call our dual mandate, and\nthis has implications for asset-purchase policies (and when to stop them). The statement\nissued after our last policy meeting highlighted that we expect to continue the asset\npurchase program until the economy experiences significant improvement in labor\nmarket conditions. How forcefully and how long to pursue asset purchases is\ncomplicated – by the uncertainty surrounding the effects of unconventional policies; by\nthe usual difficulty in assessing progress toward our dual mandate (given the sometimes\nnoisy signals of both inflationary pressure and labor market conditions); and by the\nreality that the amount of stimulus provided by our asset purchases depends in part on\nmarket participants’ assessment of the likely size of the asset purchase program.5\nThe last complication is the result of the open-ended asset purchase program,\nsince it does not entail a fixed amount or duration of purchases; in this respect it is more\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlike conventional policy in the past. In fact, the decision of when to stop easing during a\nrecovery is a complicated matter even in more normal times, when pursuing conventional\nmonetary policy through changes in the federal funds rate. Importantly, the economic\nconditions associated with the last easing action during a recovery are highly dependent\non the extent of inflationary pressures at the time.\nGiven that the current inflation rate is quite low and is expected to stay low for\nseveral years, we have the flexibility to push for more improvement in labor markets than\nif inflation were not so subdued. My own personal assessment is that as long as inflation\nand inflation expectations are expected to remain well-behaved in the medium term, we\nshould continue to forcefully pursue asset purchases at least until the national\nunemployment rate falls below 7.25 percent and then assess the situation.\nI think of this number as a threshold, not as a trigger – and the distinction is\nimportant. I think of a trigger as a set of conditions that necessarily imply a change in\npolicy. A threshold, unlike a trigger, does not necessarily precipitate a change in policy.\nInstead, I think of my proposed threshold as follows. Once the unemployment rate\ndeclines to this level, we would undertake a full assessment of labor market conditions\nand inflationary pressures to determine whether further asset purchases are consistent\nwith the desired trajectory for reaching our inflation and unemployment mandates in the\nmedium term. Thus, a threshold precipitates a discussion and a more thorough\nassessment of appropriate policy, versus a trigger which starts a change in policy. As an\nexample, suppose we reach one’s threshold unemployment rate but at that time the\neconomy is slowing, and no further improvement in the unemployment rate is expected in\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe short to medium term. This hypothetical situation would not necessarily imply a\nchange in policy stance, especially if inflation was projected to remain below target.\nLet me say also that an unemployment rate of 7.25 sounds high, but achieving an\nunemployment rate of 7.25 percent would require real GDP growth of roughly 3 percent\nfor a year. That would be growth that is a full percentage point faster than the economy’s\nso-called “potential” rate of growth, making this a challenge to achieve.\nAnd as I noted, this is a threshold, not a trigger – at the 7.25 percent threshold the\nassessment of continued asset purchases would commence. It is worth noting that a\nvariety of factors outside the realm of monetary policy (for example demographics) affect\nhow low unemployment can get without igniting inflationary pressures.6 But my own\npersonal view is that if inflationary pressures remain muted, then labor market conditions\nwould need to be more like 6.5 percent unemployment to warrant the federal funds rate\nbeing lifted off the zero bound.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me say a bit about the economic context and outlook. We\nare in the third year of the recovery, and the economy has averaged close to 2 percent\ngrowth over that time, which is faster than many other advanced economies but too slow\nto return the nation to anything like full employment anytime soon.\nTo promote faster growth, with the hope of speeding up improvement in labor\nmarkets, the Federal Reserve announced additional monetary accommodation at our\nSeptember 2012 policy meeting.7 Three key aspects of the announcement were the\ncontinuation of our approach to exchanging short-term securities for long-term securities\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthrough December (the maturity extension program), the plan to purchase $40 billion in\nmortgage-backed securities each month until significant improvement in labor markets is\nachieved, and the indication that short-term rates are expected to remain exceptionally\nlow through mid-2015.\nNow I would like to say a bit more about each of my three main points – the\neffect of unconventional policy, the inflation outlook, and the dual mandate and its\nimplications for asset purchase policies.\n\nPoint #1: The Effect of Unconventional Policy\nGiven both the July statement of the policy committee, and Chairman Bernanke’s\nAugust speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, there was a good deal\nof anticipation in financial markets that more forceful policy action would be taken.8\nBoth were interpreted as indicating a likelihood of further action.\nAs Figure 1 shows, many financial markets began moving well before the\nSeptember announcement – and by the time of the actual announcement stock prices had\nrisen, mortgage rates had fallen, corporate bond rates had fallen, and exchange rates had\ndeclined modestly (a peripheral by-product of lower U.S. rates). Such movements in\nfinancial markets are quite consistent with the normal reaction to conventional monetary\npolicy announcements.\nThe effect of policy on longer-term rates seems in turn to be having a positive\nimpact on the economy. To affect growth in the economy, financial market movements\nneed to encourage firms and households to adjust their behavior. Of course, while it\nremains too early to fully assess the effect of our September action, households appear to\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbe reacting to the easing in financial conditions. Figure 2 shows the four-week moving\naverage of mortgage loan applications. One line reflects the refinance index, which has\nclearly been trending up recently. Even more encouraging has been the increase in the\npurchase index. The drop in mortgage rates at this time has the potential to be\nparticularly effective given that housing prices in some regions of the country are\nbeginning to rise. That, coupled with the risk that rates will rise once the purchase\nprogram is over, provides incentives not to defer purchase decisions.\nFigure 3 shows that this increased activity is beginning to generate new home\nconstruction, as housing starts have been trending up recently. This is consistent with the\nmore qualitative anecdotes I hear from bankers around New England – that they are\nseeing, and are willing to lend to, strong construction firms that are selling new homes\nonce they are built.\nThere are, of course, other channels that transmit the Fed’s action to the economy.\nUnconventional monetary policy actions have produced strength in several interest-ratesensitive sectors since they began in earnest – building on the earlier moves to quickly\nmake policy accommodative as the financial crisis and recession unfolded, and to keep\npolicy accommodative in light of a very tepid recovery. Figure 4 shows that auto loan\nrates at commercial banks also have been declining. The low cost of financing cars,\nalong with positive wealth effects from increases in housing prices and stock prices, have\nhelped to stimulate more robust auto sales – as you can see in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows that consumer durables have been stronger in this recovery than\nduring the previous two recoveries. This is despite a very weak housing market which\npresumably limited many durable goods purchases commonly associated with home\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nbuying. Despite this significant “headwind,” I think we can say that the accommodative\nstance of monetary policy and indeed the use of unconventional monetary policy have\nhelped make interest-sensitive consumer durable purchases more affordable.\nWhile the household sector has been responding to monetary policy actions, the\nresponse by businesses has been more muted. Firms appear to be deferring decisions\nuntil they have better clarity on the U.S. fiscal situation and on the likely path of\ninternational economic conditions. However, a continued household sector rebound is\nlikely to improve demand and business conditions, encouraging more business\ninvestment – particularly once some of these downside risks and uncertainties are\nresolved.\n\nPoint #2: The Inflation Outlook\nOne of the concerns voiced about unconventional monetary policy is that\nexpanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet – injecting large quantities of reserves into\nthe banking system – could be inflationary. Let’s look to the data to assess this concern.\nFigure 7 provides a measure of inflation – changes in the total personal\nconsumption expenditure price index for the period since 2000. The average of yearover-year changes in the PCE price index has been 2.2 percent, quite close to our 2\npercent target. However, it has been quite variable over the period, with PCE inflation\nsignificantly exceeding 3 percent during some periods and actually turning negative in\nthe midst of the Great Recession. This volatility is partly attributed to periods of food\nand energy shocks, where price movements have tended to be sharp but temporary.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 8 provides the changes in the personal consumption expenditure price\nindex removing these volatile food and energy components. To be sure, the Fed is\nconcerned about inflation including these components, as food and energy constitute an\nimportant share of essential household expenditures for people. But temporary\nmovements in these components can obscure the underlying trend in overall inflation, so\nit can be useful to look at the inflation rate taking out food and energy. Over this period,\nthe core PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.9 percent, which is slightly below our 2\npercent target for total PCE inflation. And you can see that the core inflation measure\nhas been far less volatile, remaining in a range between 1 and 3 percent.\nFigure 9 shows both PCE and Core PCE inflation expressed as quarterly changes\nat annual rates. Over the past 12 years there have been a large number of quarters in\nwhich inflation has exceeded 2 percent – thus 2 percent has never been a “ceiling” for\ninflation. The distribution of quarterly core PCE inflation shows many fewer extreme\nobservations, but nonetheless has exhibited a fairly broad range of outcomes. So while\nrecent history has seen an underlying rate of inflation that is relatively stable around our\ntarget, I would suggest that attempting to hold actual inflation in lockstep with our 2\npercent target over short timeframes is probably not realistic.\nBeyond the U.S. situation, I would also point to Japan’s experience as instructive.\nAs I have pointed out many times, despite having an expanded balance sheet for an\nextended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a deflation problem rather than an\ninflation problem. 9\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nPoint #3: The Implications for Asset Purchase Policies\nThe Fed’s recently announced, unconventional asset purchase policies do seem to\nbe having the desired effects, and the inflation rate remains below our 2 percent target.\nHowever, this policy action included the announcement that asset purchases will continue\nuntil the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. In other words, the policy\naction is open-ended versus time-bound. Should the economy experience another shock\n– say from a U.S. “fiscal cliff” situation or a shock from abroad, then we could lengthen\nthe period of purchases or increase the amounts (or both). Similarly, favorable shocks\nwould mean that we would purchase fewer securities.\nThe open-ended approach is particularly useful to convey that monetary policy\nwill serve as an “automatic stabilizer” should shocks occur – one hopes at least mitigating\npossible shocks that could buffet the economy. I say “mitigating” because monetary\npolicy would not necessarily be able to fully and immediately offset large shocks.\nAs with conventional monetary policy, decisions about the ideal timing for ending\nunconventional monetary stimulus require balancing a variety of considerations. Figure\n10 shows the economic conditions at the end of the easing cycle for the last three\nrecessions. The end of the easing cycle in 1992 started despite weak labor markets, in\npart because of the high inflation rate at the time. The end of the easing cycle in 2001\noccurred when the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.1 percent, in part because inflation\nwas only 1.9 percent at the time.\nThe figure highlights that ending a cycle of easing during a recovery is highly\ndependent on a variety of economic factors. With lower inflation rates, it is possible to\nmaintain the easing until the labor market shows more significant improvement. This\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nwould be consistent with a balanced approach to both elements of the Fed’s dual\nmandate.\nThe variables actually considered by policymakers are much broader than the\nvariables reflected in Figure 10. No single variable perfectly captures the underlying rate\nof inflation, as the sharp differences between core and total PCE indicate. Similarly, no\nsingle variable perfectly captures conditions in the labor market – for example,\nunemployment rates can fall because workers become discouraged and leave the labor\nforce, or because of a rapid expansion in hiring.\nEven if there were single variables that fully captured labor market conditions and\ninflationary pressures, the future path of those variables would depend on a wide range of\nfactors. Most importantly, and consistent with the definition of a threshold discussed\nearlier, an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent when growth is expected to be below 2\npercent is very different from the same rate when growth is expected to be 4 percent or\nhigher. In the first case, one might expect labor market conditions to deteriorate in future\nquarters. In the second, one would normally expect to see further significant\nimprovement in labor market conditions.\nFurthermore, because we are far from our normal policies, we must acknowledge\nthe uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of these policies, as well as our ability to execute\na graceful exit from unconventional policy (that is, to return to conventional federal funds\nrate policy, and to reduce our large balance sheet to a size more consistent with a\nnormally-functioning economy). Given the lack of historical experience in exiting such a\nlarge balance sheet, the possibility of unintended consequences should not be dismissed.\nWe are very attuned to these concerns and are working to address them.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nDespite the challenge to communicating in simple terms the likely exit strategy, I\nwill say that my own preference would be to continue asset purchases until we had at\nleast reached an unemployment rate of 7.25 percent, given the low rates of inflation we\nhave been experiencing and are likely to be experiencing over the medium term –\nhowever, I will say again that this is a threshold, not a trigger. Assuming that inflation\nand inflation expectations remain well-behaved, at that point the discussion should center\non whether overall labor market conditions are consistent with “substantial\nimprovement” – for example, whether the lower unemployment rate reflects job creation\nrather than reductions in the labor force as discouraged workers stop seeking jobs;\nwhether we are seeing sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we\nenvision continued substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come.\nUnder those conditions, I would stop asset purchases.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, let me reiterate that household spending patterns are\nconsistent with some improvement in the economy, and appear to be responding (as\ndesired) to monetary policy accommodation. Nonetheless, abrupt fiscal austerity or\nadverse shocks from abroad could still overwhelm the nascent positives. Hurricane\nSandy’s effects could exact a toll on the fourth-quarter performance of the economy. In\ngeneral, potential downside risks make an open-ended monetary policy particularly\nattractive, because policy can recalibrate in response to such shocks without starting up\nnew programs.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, November 1, 2012 at 5:10 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nCertainly I hope that these risks will subside, and we will quickly see more\nimprovement in the economy – leading to a substantial improvement in labor markets and\nan early end to our asset purchase program.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you at Babson, and I would be\nhappy to field a few questions from the students and faculty here today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the overview by Chairman Ben Bernanke in the Question 1 section of “Five Questions about the\nFederal Reserve and Monetary Policy” – remarks at the Economic Club of Indiana available on the Board\nof Governors web site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121001a.htm\n\n2\n\nAlso see remarks by Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy C.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Community Development Advisory Council’s 2012\nRegional Convening\nLawrence, Massachusetts\nSeptember 24, 2012\n\nGood morning and thank you for being part of this conference focused on New\nEngland’s mid-sized cities. The issues and opportunities facing these cities have\nprobably not received enough attention from the full spectrum of policymakers. Today’s\nconference highlights some topics on which the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans to\nfocus over the next several years.\nToday I would like to summarize just why it is so important that there be\nincreased attention to mid-sized cities. Allow me to give you a short preview and then\ncover these points in a bit more detail, and with a close look at some key data.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAs always, I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nI first want to describe the importance of these cities. New England’s mid-sized\ncities – with populations between 75,000 and 200,000 people – taken together have a\npopulation roughly similar to that of Greater Boston, 1 which represents New England’s\nlargest and most economically vibrant urban area.\nHowever, the mid-sized cities differ in important ways from Boston. They have\nnot seen the same degree of economic vibrancy as residents in Greater Boston, but they\ndo encompass an important source of future growth, in a couple of ways. One, they\nfrequently serve as an entry point for new immigrants, and two, they have on average a\nyounger population than the rest of New England.\nSecond, I want to highlight today the recent economic trends in these cities.\nCertainly these cities have struggled over the past several decades. Their manufacturing\nbase has shrunk, and many have yet to replace lost jobs with new and innovative sectors.\nAs more middle-class families have moved away, these cities face greater challenges in\nhelping their residents acquire the skills and job market opportunities they need to escape\nfrom poverty. While all of these mid-sized cities have struggled and continue to struggle\nto overcome serious obstacles, the economic data indicate that some have done better\nthan others in turning around their economies. It is this revitalization – relative\nresurgence (using indicators such as median family income, poverty rates, and population\ngrowth) – that we all want to see replicated in those cities that are having difficulties\nreengineering themselves.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinally I want to emphasize that I think these cities can indeed become resurgent\ncities. The Boston Federal Reserve Bank staff has done some thoughtful research in this\narea, and has been actively engaged with people like you, in this room, to consider how\nto generate more revitalization in cities in New England. This conference and our future\nwork in this area will, we hope, be of assistance. At the Bank we will continue to look at\nways that we can help – through quantitative and qualitative research, outreach,\ninformation gathering and dissemination, and our ability to convene stakeholders. I hope\nthat together with people like you, gathered here today, we can see more concentrated\nfocus on New England’s mid-sized cities, and more achievement.\n\nThe Importance of Mid-Sized Cities\nLet me say a bit more about the importance of mid-sized cities. Figure 1 tells us\nabout the aggregate population of the New England’s mid-sized cities compared to the\nregion as a whole and to Greater Boston. The cities between 75,000 and 200,000 people 2\nhave, taken together, an aggregate population of 2.2 million people – just a little smaller\nthan the 2.3 million people living in the greater Boston area. So, taken together, roughly\na third of all New Englanders (about 4.5 million people) live in either the Greater Boston\nmetropolitan area or in one of New England’s mid-sized cities.\nIn Massachusetts, legislation defined “gateway cities” as those between 35,000\nand 250,000 people that also fall below the statewide average for income and education. 3\nThese 24 cities as a group account for 1.7 million people. Together, the population in the\nGreater Boston metropolitan area plus the gateway cities account for almost two-thirds of\nthe population of Massachusetts.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 2 shows that for New England and Massachusetts, the mid-sized cities are\na major entry point for foreign-born residents. While only about 13 percent of the U.S.\npopulation is foreign-born, New England as a whole has an even lower share of foreignborn residents (only about 12 percent). However, when looking at New England midsized cities and the Massachusetts gateway cities, much greater shares of residents are\nforeign-born – about 21 percent, or more than one in five residents. In a region of the\ncountry experiencing relatively slow population growth, immigrants are an important\npotential source of growth in the supply of labor.\nFigure 3 shows that these cities have populations that are on net younger than the\nstate and region. The figure shows the shares of the population below 15 years of age\nand 65 years of age and older. For Massachusetts and New England around 18 percent of\nthe population is below 15 years of age, but New England’s mid-sized cities and\nMassachusetts gateway cities have a bit larger share of their population under 15 years of\nage. The mid-sized cities also have a somewhat lower percentage of their population\nover 65 years of age relative to New England as a whole, and the same is true for the\ngateway cities relative to Massachusetts.\nThe younger overall population and the influx of foreign-born residents into our\nregion’s mid-sized cities can be an important source of potential economic growth.\nHowever, there are some significant impediments to these resources being fully utilized,\nand that will impact whether these mid-sized cities prosper and become sources of\nstrength in the regional economy.\nFor example, Figure 4 shows differences in poverty rates. New England’s midsized cities have a much higher percentage of the population in poverty compared to New\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nEngland more generally. The picture is similar in Massachusetts: the gateway cities have\nmuch higher rates of poverty than the state as a whole. These higher poverty rates are a\nserious impediment if they reflect, or perpetuate, residents of mid-sized cities being less\nlikely to obtain the skills necessary to be gainfully employed in today’s economy.\nTo that end, Figure 5 shows that educational attainment varies greatly across the\nregion. While New England and Massachusetts have much higher educational attainment\nthan the rest of the country, that educational attainment is uneven across the region.\nWhile 46 percent of the population in Greater Boston 4 has a bachelor’s degree or above,\nthe mid-sized cities in New England have a much lower 24.5 percent of their population\nwith a bachelor’s degree or above. The figure is even lower for the Massachusetts\ngateway cities, which have only 22.7 percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree\nor above – less than half the rate of the Greater Boston area.\nIf mid-sized cities are to serve as a potential source of growth for New England’s\neconomy, it is important that the work force be able to acquire the skills and opportunities\nnecessary to succeed. Work force development efforts, and initiatives that provide strong\neducational opportunities for all residents of our mid-sized cities – including new\nimmigrants and their children – are likely to be a key necessity if these cities are to\nflourish.\n\nResurgent cities\nIn recent research covering not only New England, but also the mid-Atlantic,\nMidwest, and upper South, my Boston Fed colleagues Yolanda Kodrzycki and Ana\nPatricia Muñoz have worked to identify key factors that set cities apart – in particular,\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nwhat factors make some cities relatively resurgent while other cities do not make similar\nimprovements.\nTheir research shows that even the relatively resurgent cities (those cities that\noutperformed their peers) have had difficulty improving at the same rate as the country as\na whole. Figure 6 reflects median family income in the resurgent cities and in other\ncities, 5 as a share of U.S. median family income, over the last 50 years or so. While the\nmedian family income in cities that were not considered resurgent was only a little above\n60 percent of the median family income of the nation – and declining – the median family\nincome in the relatively resurgent cities was a little above 80 percent of the median\nfamily income of the nation, and still declining although at a lower rate. This highlights\nsome of the challenges facing even the cities that are making progress.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment does seem to be a key factor.\nEducational attainment was significantly better in the resurgent cities than in those cities\nthat were not considered resurgent. 6\nSeparately, I would note that many of New England’s mid-sized cities are along\ncoasts. This provides certain opportunities to the extent that they have port facilities, but\nalso provides opportunities to attract tourists and new residents. Both Providence and\nNew Haven show stronger growth in median household income relative to the U.S. than\nother mid-sized cities since 2000, as Figure 8 shows.\nProvidence, New Haven, and Worcester were the three New England cities\nclassified as resurgent by Kodrzycki and Muñoz. These three cities all have a strong\nacademic presence in their cities, as well as serving as major medical centers.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIndeed, I would note that many of these mid-sized cities, including many that are\nnot yet resurgent, are at the crossroads of transportation hubs, or have become regional\nmedical centers, or have educational institutions as “anchor tenants” in their cities. Many\nmid-sized cities have not yet fully leveraged these potential attributes to attract industries\nand promote growth. Increasingly, medical centers and universities have been shown to\nbe potential development hubs. Worcester has benefited from its focus on the life\nsciences. Cities with colleges and universities that find ways to use those resources to\nfoster development are likely to be among the cities that better succeed over time.\n\nThe “Softer Side” of Development\nOne of the interesting findings in the work of I mentioned by Yolanda Kodrzycki\nand Ana Patricia Muñoz is that one of the main characteristics of the resurgent cities is\nthe presence of collaborative civic leadership. Whether catalyzed by leaders in the\nprivate sector, public sector, or non-profit sector, it seems that the resurgent cities have\ndeveloped a vision for progress that has the shared support of the entire community and a\nvariety of leaders.\nFrequently the cities that have lost important sectors of employment – for\nexample the loss of manufacturing jobs in many New England cities – also lose some of\nthe cohesion in their communities. Charitable and civic organizations benefit from\ncompanies contributing to leadership in the community, so the loss of major firms when a\nsector declines is anything but positive. Civic cohesion and collaboration across political\nlines can also be impacted. And changing demographics in cities can make it more\nchallenging – but no less important – to achieve effective collaboration.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nClearly, a collaborative vision for a community cannot be imposed from the\noutside. It requires residents to engage and find ways to leverage the city’s positive\nattributes for the benefit of all citizens.\nWe hope that this conference serves as a basis for more positive work in this area.\nLet me bring up Figure 9, which lists the cities I have been speaking about this morning.\nWe expect that the mid-sized city issues I’ve touched on will be a focus of our\ncommunity outreach over the next several years, with a particular attention on\ncollaborative civic leadership. I look forward to hearing the ideas of participants, and the\nsuggestions you have on how the Boston Fed can help.\nTogether and with a lot of thoughtful, persistent work I am certain we can build\non the strengths and resources in our region’s mid-sized cities, to see their more rapid\ndevelopment.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nGreater Boston is defined as the group of 75 cities and towns identified by the University of\nMassachusetts’ Donahue Institute along and inside the I-495 corridor and cited as the “Greater Boston\nKnowledge Core” in the MassInc/Brookings Institute study “Reconnecting Massachusetts Gateway Cities:\nLessons Learned and an Agenda for Renewal.” To calculate the population shares, six cities categorized\namong the 24 Gateway cities as defined by the Massachusetts State Legislature (Chelsea, Everett, Lynn,\nMalden, Quincy and Revere), were excluded from the group.\n\n2\n\nDifferent parties use different definitions for smaller cities, gateway cities, and mid-sized cities. We\ndefine mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000,\nexcluding “suburb cities” of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New\nHaven, CT; Norwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA;\nLowell, MA; Lynn, MA; New Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worcester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua,\nNH; Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and Warwick, RI.\n3\n\nThe 24 gateway cities include Barnstable, Brockton, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg,\nHaverhill, Holyoke, Lawrence, Leominster, Lowell, Lynn, Malden, Methuen, New Bedford, Pittsfield,\nQuincy, Revere, Salem, Springfield, Taunton, Westfield, and Worcester. Median income measures and\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:20 A.M.

Specifically a gateway municipality is defined as “a municipality with a population\ngreater than 35,000 and less than 250,000, a median household income below the Commonwealth’s\naverage and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or above that is below the\nCommonwealth’s average.”\n4\n\nThis calculation is based on data for Greater Boston cities and towns with population of 20,000 or more as\nthree-year American Community Survey estimates are only available for cities and towns with population\nof 20,000 or more.\n\n5\n\nThe resurgent cities include Evansville, IN; Fort Wayne, IN; Grand Rapids, MI; Greensboro, NC; Jersey\nCity, NJ; New Haven, CT; Peoria, IL; Providence, RI; Winston-Salem, NC; and Worcester, MA. The other\ncities include Akron, OH; Allentown, PA; Bridgeport, CT; Dayton, OH; Erie, PA; Flint, MI; Gary, IN;\nHartford, CT; Paterson, NJ; Rochester, NY; Rockford, IL; South Bend, IN; Springfield, MA; Syracuse,\nNY; Waterbury, CT; and Youngstown, OH.\n\n6\n\nWhile some of the college attainment may have to do with attracting new college educated residents, the\nhigh school attainment figure in particular demonstrates consistent local improvement in education.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSouth Shore Chamber of Commerce\nQuincy, Massachusetts\nSeptember 20, 2012\n\nGood morning and thank you for the opportunity to be with you at the South\nShore Chamber of Commerce.\nAs always, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nI know it’s still early morning, but allow me to start with an observation about\neconomists, historians, and the word “Great.” Historians tend to use “Great” to reflect\nsuccess, particularly military success that results in territorial expansion – think\nAlexander the Great or Peter the Great. In economics, “Great” is used quite differently.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIt’s usually applied to difficult episodes with serious economic consequences – think of\nthe Great Depression or the so-called Great Recession. Often such an episode involves\neconomic policymaking – fiscal, monetary, or otherwise – that contributes to the situation\nor fails to alleviate it.\nI have titled this talk \"Acting to Avoid a Great Stagnation” and let me be clear, I\ndo believe the Federal Reserve is taking appropriate and forceful action to help the U.S.\navoid a prolonged economic stagnation.\nLet me explain the terms. In my view a Great Stagnation – in current times or any\nother – would be a long episode that generally includes a willingness among\npolicymakers to accept as inevitable, and decline to resist, far-less-than-optimal\noutcomes. Such outcomes could include higher unemployment, with the potential result\nthat high unemployment could become entrenched as a more permanent feature of the\neconomic landscape. 1\nWhat I am highlighting is the importance and appropriateness of taking the policy\nactions that are necessary to improve economic conditions much more quickly – so the\nperiod of very slow recovery that we have been experiencing of late does not persist and\nbecome a Great Stagnation or in fact a “Great” anything.\nUnfortunately, the global economy is experiencing a slowdown, and that\nslowdown is one of the significant impediments to faster growth in the domestic\neconomy. Failure to react to this slowdown would risk a situation where difficult\nconditions prevail for long enough to become “Great” in the economist’s sense. This\ncould occur if policymakers of all sorts – monetary, fiscal, economic, and financial –\nwere to adopt a stance of only reacting to large negative shocks, while accepting (and\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndeclining to act against) a status quo of substantial underutilization of resources, for an\nextended period of time.\nThis sort of scenario would be particularly tragic in the job market, and I would\nnote that over the course of this year there has been no meaningful improvement in the\nunacceptably high level of the U.S. unemployment rate. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke\nhas called this a “grave concern” and I fully agree with him.\nLast week the group charged with monetary policymaking in the U.S., the\nFOMC, took additional monetary policy actions to promote faster economic growth. I\nfully support the policy actions. Let me say a bit about them. First, the FOMC noted that\nit anticipates that low short-term rates are likely to be warranted at least through mid2015. This guidance makes clear that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a\nconsiderable time, likely even after labor markets improve from their current subdued\nstate, in order to promote a robust and sustainable recovery.\nSecond, given the desire to increase policy accommodation even while the\ntraditional policy instrument (the federal funds rate) is at the zero lower bound, the\nFOMC announced plans to buy $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities a month\n– until such time as there is substantial ongoing improvement in labor markets. The more\nopen-ended nature of the action – intending to continue such purchases until labor\nmarkets have improved – is an important change. Of course, the Fed will do so in the\ncontext of price stability (which is the other half of the Fed’s “dual mandate,” along with\nmaximum sustainable employment) – and hand in hand with a careful ongoing\nassessment of the program’s costs and efficacy.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nOf course policy actions such as these are unconventional, and do entail risks.\nHowever, in my view the risks involved in pursuing these policies are considerably\nsmaller and more manageable than the risk of allowing the economy to stagnate for\nanother year or more.\nThe U.S. has seen a series of “false starts” during this recovery. After earlier\nperiods of policy accommodation the economy has improved, but that improvement has\nnot been sustained. These false starts have been interrupted by both natural and manmade disasters, here and abroad. As a consequence of these interruptions, the recovery\nhas been painfully slow by historical standards – resulting in our current highly-elevated\nunemployment rate and an inflation rate below our objective.\nAbsent further policy action, most economists expect several more years of weak\nlabor markets and low inflation. As a consequence, it was time for the Fed to announce\nstimulus that will continue until the U.S. achieves both faster economic growth and lower\nunemployment, no matter the unanticipated interruptions.\nToday I would like to walk through my analysis of the economic situation in more\ndetail. In doing so I hope it will become clear why I have strongly supported the kind of\nforceful action that the FOMC took last week. In my view, these policies are essential to\nachieving a strong sustainable recovery that is resilient, despite the inevitable disruptions.\nLet me add that I am only discussing monetary policy, not fiscal policy, since fiscal\npolicy, though powerful, is not in the Fed’s jurisdiction.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAvoiding a Stagnation\nFigure 1 provides a powerful real-world example of the potential for a Great\nStagnation – the experience of Japan after their financial crisis, which began in 1990.\nWhile this period is sometimes called the “Lost Decade,” that is actually a misnomer –\nsince the period of stagnant growth has lasted over two decades.\nThere are many factors contributing to a Great Stagnation in Japan, including a\nvery slow realization of the need to recapitalize banks, and a population whose average\nage is rapidly rising (which changes the composition of economic activity in a country),\nand a substantial slowdown in population growth. Still, it is striking that there was a\ndramatic change in the growth of real GDP in Japan coinciding with the start of their\nfinancial crisis. 2 The muted policy response to the slower growth that began during the\nfinancial crisis is partly responsible for the fact that Japanese growth never returned to its\npre-crisis rate, or to where output would have been had the crisis not occurred (the path\nillustrated by the trend line, based on growth over the 1980-1990 period).\nFigure 2 shows the level of U.S. GDP since 1980. Note that we too have a\nnoticeable break in the growth rate of GDP at the advent of the recent financial crisis.\nHowever, unlike the Japanese, it appears that we have resumed the pre-crisis growth rate.\nBut we have not returned the economy back to its original growth path, the only time we\nhave failed to do so in all ten of our other post-war recessions – including the severe\nrecession in 1982.\nFailing to return quickly to the original trend line is much more serious than a\ngraph can convey. It implies a significant cumulative loss in goods and services that\nshould have been produced (measured as the sum of the difference between those two\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nlines), which in turn implies a significant shortfall in employment relative to full\nemployment.\nAs a result, the goal of monetary and fiscal policy should be to return the\neconomy back to the original trend line. This means getting faster than normal growth\nuntil resources are once again fully utilized. A risk in not doing so is that we\npermanently reduce our trend growth rate, which is what appears to have happened in\nJapan.\n\nCauses of Slow Growth in the United States\nExploring in detail the many possible causes of slow growth in the current\neconomy is beyond the scope of this talk. But let me just highlight some important\nfactors. Figure 3 shows, and compares, the growth rates of real GDP and real GDP\nexcluding residential investment (housing) and government spending. As the chart\nshows, there is a notable difference in the growth rates. While real GDP has grown only\nby 2.21 percent, real GDP excluding housing and government spending grew by 2.45\npercent. Had the economy not had the headwinds from government and housing\ndragging growth lower – had it grown just by that higher rate of 2.45 percent over the\nthree years of the recovery – outcomes would be somewhat better. However, normally a\nsector like housing would be expected to grow much more quickly than other sectors of\nthe economy in the early stages of a recovery – given housing's interest-rate sensitivity –\nand thus we would expect it to provide more impetus to overall economic growth.\nTo consider the role of housing a bit more, Figure 4 shows housing starts from\n2000 onward. The decline in housing starts is striking, and unlike in most other\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecoveries the housing sector did not participate in the initial stages of the current\nrecovery – although there has been some improvement recently.\nHowever, I think there are some reasons to believe the recent nascent signs of a\nhousing recovery might be durable. Since the onset of the housing bust the population\nhas grown and per capita income has grown, while interest rates are very low and prices\nare more affordable. These are all positives when it comes to having potential buyers\nready to purchase homes.\nThese circumstances make it an important time for policymakers to consider\nadditional stimulus to the housing market to finally induce progress. Consider the market\npsychology: if home buyers feel that house prices are on the rise (as many indicators\nsuggest), and that mortgage rates will only remain this low temporarily, we could see new\nhome buyers come off the sidelines and commit to purchase new homes before rates rise\nand before house prices rise further than they have.\nAlso, Figure 5 shows growth in state and local government spending since 2000\nand highlights that it has been unusually weak in this recovery. This is, in large part, a\nresult of state and local governments pulling back in response to greatly diminished\nrevenues – a direct consequence of the depth of the recession and the weakness of the\nrecovery. Many states were prepared for a revenue shortfall, having accumulated “rainy\nday” funds, but the long downturn sapped those funds. Since nationally, the sum of state\nand local government spending is larger than federal spending 3, the net impact has been\nthat government-sector spending has been a significant drag on growth during the\nrecovery.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 6 highlights another force dragging on the U.S. recovery, the global\neconomic slowdown. Many advanced economies experienced a deeper recession (as\nmeasured by output) than did the United States, and countries such as the U.K., France,\nand Japan have real GDP levels indexed below where they were at the end of 2007, an\neven weaker rebound than in the United States. Furthermore, in the last several quarters\nseveral of the advanced economies in Europe have actually been in decline as they have\nslashed their government spending.\n\nCosts of a Slow Recovery\nA slow recovery can have significant costs. Allow me to show you some charts\nthat are compelling – acknowledging, of course, that charts cannot convey the human toll\nof the situation they depict.\nFigure 7 shows the ratio of employment to population, which has remained very\nflat during the recovery. This is consistent with the growth in GDP being only about 2\npercent – which is enough to keep up with the growth in productivity and the labor force\nbut not leading to the employment of a larger percent of the population. By the way,\nwhile there have been some demographic shifts within the workforce that might explain\nsome decline in the employment-to-population ratio, they do not explain the trend in\nFigure 7; indeed, a very similar pattern emerges when looking at the employment-topopulation ratio for particular age groups.\nFigure 8 shows one of the painful and unusual features of this recession and\nrecovery, the very elevated percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for\nmore than six months. Unlike the deep recession in 1982, in which there was a quick\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nrecovery and as a result a relatively small and short-lived increase in long-duration\nunemployment, the last recession and long, weak recovery have resulted in substantially\nmore people suffering long spells of unemployment. Long periods of unemployment\nfrequently deplete the savings of the unemployed, make re-employment harder (as\nemployers may be tentative about hiring those who have been unemployed for long\nperiods of time), and may lead to skills becoming less than current. These problems\nhighlight why it is important to generate faster growth to avoid what some call labor\nmarket “scarring” – where long-duration unemployment becomes ingrained into our labor\nmarket.\n\nWhat Should Monetary Policymakers Do?\nThe Great Stagnation in Japan did lead to a monetary policy response from the\nJapanese central bank. The Bank of Japan eased rates until they hit the zero lower bound,\nand then as Figure 9 shows, began to gradually expand the assets of the central bank.\nHowever, there were key differences from the policy actions we have taken at the\nFederal Reserve. The Bank of Japan only gradually expanded the assets on its balance\nsheet, and only after a delay of a number of years. Many of its purchases were of shortterm securities, which had little impact on already-low short-term rates. This is in\ncontrast to the impact that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s purchases of longer-duration assets\nhave had on longer-term rates, which remain well above zero and thus have room to\ndecline.\nFinally, the Japanese central bank may in my view have prematurely stopped the\ngrowth in their balance sheet, considering the weakness in the Japanese economy at the\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ntime. As a result, the Japanese economy has remained stagnant and despite having an\nexpanded balance sheet for an extended period, the Japanese continue to struggle with a\ndeflation problem rather than an inflation problem, as the bottom chart on Figure 9\nshows.\nTurning to the U.S., the differences in policy are quite striking. There was a rapid\nexpansion of the Fed’s balance sheet (see Figure 10), as well as a fiscal stimulus. This\nmay be why we have not experienced a significant decline in the trend growth rate in the\neconomy, seen in an earlier chart. There has also been a focus on bringing long-term\ninterest rates down, and more recently on utilizing monetary policy communication\nstrategies to convey that rates will likely remain low until the recovery and labor markets\nshow a more sustained improvement.\nTo reiterate, a key difference is that we didn’t hesitate (by years) to take\nsignificant actions in the U.S. And when we took actions, they were forceful. And going\nforward, we also don’t want to make the mistake of retreating at the first, early signs of\nimprovement. Japan’s experience suggests one must continue until improvement is\nsustainable and will persist.\nHowever, despite these differences there is an important similarity between our\nsituation and Japan’s, as well. Just as Japan has not experienced inflation despite a rapid\nexpansion of their balance sheet, our measure of inflation (the personal consumption\nexpenditure deflator) is currently only 1.3 percent through July despite our balance sheet\nexpanding significantly four years ago (see the bottom chart on Figure 10).\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRecent Actions\nLast Thursday the FOMC announced several new policies, summarized in the\nnext two slides. The Fed announced a number of important policy changes.\nFirst, in addition to exchanging (as previously announced) $45 billion of shortterm Treasury securities for an equal amount of long-term Treasury bonds through the\nmaturity extension program running through December, the Fed will purchase $40 billion\na month in agency mortgage backed securities (MBS). These purchases of MBS should\nplace downward pressure on U.S. mortgage rates, which should support the housing\nmarket by lowering borrowing costs and providing additional support for house-prices to\nappreciate from depressed levels. The housing market should be stronger than if these\nactions were not taken.\nSecond, the purchases of agency MBS will likely affect the yields on other,\nsimilar long-term assets, such as Treasury bonds and corporate bonds. Bonds of similar\nmaturity, duration and risk characteristics are viewed as substitutes for MBS by many\ninvestors. Removing some of the MBS from private circulation will create a scarcity of\nlong-maturity, lower-risk securities. This shortage will lower both MBS and other longterm interest rates in the marketplace, with effects that are qualitatively similar to the\neffects we have when we lower the federal funds rate (something we cannot do now, as it\nis at the zero lower bound). As a consequence, our policy will have effects on a broad\narray of economic activity beyond the direct effects on residential investment.\nThird, I would note that the plan to purchase MBS securities is open-ended. As\nthe FOMC indicated in its statement last week, the MBS purchases and potentially the\nuse of other tools will continue until there has been improvement in labor markets. This\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmeans the policy actions are being conditioned on an economic outcome rather than a set\ntimeframe. This should provide market participants confidence that the Federal Reserve\nwill do what it takes to improve economic outcomes.\nFourth, highly accommodative policy will continue for a considerable time after\nthe economic recovery strengthens. This means that we will ensure the economy is truly\nstrengthening before raising interest rates. Highly accommodative policy is currently\nlikely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\n\nThe Initial Impact of Policy Actions\nThe table shown in Figure 11 provides some estimates of the financial impacts of\nthe Fed’s recent policy announcement. Such impacts are difficult to measure with any\nprecision, given anticipation about our possible actions built into markets, and the reality\nthat other events can occur coincident with the action.\nStill, for reference the first column provides the financial market response when\nthe FOMC announcement was made. The second column extends the period to Thursday\nand Friday as financial market participants had more time to analyze the policy change\nand Chairman Bernanke’s press conference explaining the announcement. The third\ncolumn begins the financial response at the Chairman’s August speech at the Jackson\nHole conference, which was widely viewed as increasing the likelihood of a more\nforceful easing, though the specifics were not known. The final column dates the event\nfrom the prior FOMC meeting, when most observers interpreted the statement as making\nfurther forceful action more likely.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nWhile this table shows a range of impacts, I would say in sum that regardless of\nthe event window chosen, stock prices are up substantially, mortgage rates are lower, and\nexchange rates are lower. On the latter I would point out that our efforts to lower long\nrates are focused on stimulating domestic demand, but at the same time lower long-term\nrates affect demand for U.S. assets, resulting in a modest change in the exchange rate –\nand this is likely to provide some support for export-oriented industries.\nAll of these impacts are very consistent with what we would expect of the\nmonetary transmission “channels” of purchasing mortgage backed securities and\nproviding additional forward guidance on policy. In fact, they are also quite consistent\nwith the transmission channel that we expect when conducting “normal” – i.e. federal\nfunds rate – monetary policy when we are not constrained by the zero lower bound.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve last week provide significant\nadditional support to the economic recovery. They should result in stronger economic\ngrowth, and return us to full employment more quickly than would be the case absent the\npolicies.\nHowever, monetary policy is not a panacea. Appropriate fiscal policies\ndomestically, and improvement in the global economy could both provide significant\npositive effects, and shorten the time needed for unconventional monetary policy actions\nlike those we have announced. In addition, it is important to note that significant fiscal\npolicy mistakes, such as an unlikely failure to address the looming “fiscal cliff” in the\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 20, 2012 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nU.S., would have effects on economic growth that would be difficult to fully offset with\nmonetary policy.\nIt is my firm belief that the monetary policy actions taken last week should\ncontribute to a faster economic recovery and a more rapid improvement in labor markets\nthan we would have seen in their absence. However, I want to be careful not to appear to\npromise too much, as there are limits to the effects of monetary policy. Even with these\nactions, and assuming no additional negative shocks domestically or internationally, it\nwill still be several years before we are likely to return to full employment.\nWhile that is not an especially upbeat sentiment on which to end my remarks, I\nthink it underlines the importance of our taking action. A very challenging economic\nclimate confronts us all, but I am very pleased that monetary policymakers in the U.S. are\nproving willing to take difficult actions like these rather than accept the possibility of a\nlong, slow recovery turning into a stagnation that someday earns the dubious title of\n“Great.” Japan’s experience is a sobering real-world reminder of why forceful and timely\naction is appropriate.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nRecent examples of a Great Stagnation include Japan, as I will discuss in this talk, and the dynamic in\nsome European countries that experience high rates of unemployment and lagging job creation even during\nperiods of growth – a dynamic that some associate with unaffordable social benefit policies and that in\nsome corners is given the moniker “Eurosclerosis.”\n2\n\nI would note that demographic changes occurring in Japan include a gradually shrinking domestic\nworkforce. But I see this as a gradual change that would not explain the abrupt change in the growth-path\nline shown in the chart around the time of Japan’s financial crisis.\n3\n\nState and local government accounted for 63 percent of government spending on average over the period\n2000-2011.\n\n14\n\n\f",

Since that time, many banks have taken the opportunity to improve their capital ratios and\nreduce their risk, and regulators have been focused on achieving a more stable financial system, not\njust on supervision of individual institutions.1\nIndeed, global banks can provide some significant benefits because they are less susceptible to\nlocal economic problems, can introduce state-of-the-art technology and risk management tools, and\nprovide highly competitive rates for firms to finance global trade. Despite enhanced risk-management\nstrategies and the attention many global banks have given to improving their financial resilience,\nthese banks still have the potential to adversely impact2 global financial stability and economic\noutcomes – through their capacity to rapidly amplify and transmit significant financial shocks across\nsovereign and continental borders. So the banks are certainly worthy of the additional study and\nattention they are now receiving.\nToday I plan to briefly cover three related topics. First, I would like to discuss the economic\noutlook, with particular attention to recent economic trends in the United States. Second, I will\nexamine the interconnectedness of global financial institutions. Third, I will briefly review how\nintertwined banking markets showed themselves to be in 2007-2008 – with an eye to what we might\nexpect should we experience a significant financial shock emanating, for example, from Europe.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nBefore talking about these banking issues, I think it is important to provide some economic\ncontext to our discussion. In the U.S., the 2007-2009 recession led to significant excess capacity,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nparticularly in the labor market. Although the unemployment rate has declined since it reached its\npeak in October of 2009, significant excess capacity remains.\nRecent data from both the United States and China are consistent with a slowdown in\neconomic growth, and it looks like Europe is in a recession – with some European countries\nexperiencing sharply negative growth. Based on recent incoming data, many economists have been\ndowngrading their forecasts for the United States. Consistent with this trend, members of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee – which sets monetary policy in the United States – recently released (in\nJune) forecasts for the U.S. economy which show deterioration from the April economic forecast.\nThe projections shown in Figure 1 represent the central tendency of the forecasts provided by\nthe Fed Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The three highest and three lowest\nforecasts are dropped to provide the central tendency. As the figure indicates, the central tendency\nhas shifted, and now reflects an expectation that economic growth will be positive but quite weak.\nConsistent with that forecast, the FOMC participants now expect little improvement over the\nremainder of the year in the unemployment rate from its current level of 8.2 percent. In terms of\ninflation, the expectation is that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will be well below\nour target of 2 percent – with lower oil and commodity prices, a stronger dollar, and very subdued\nlabor costs all contributing to the lower inflation estimate.\nDespite this rather gloomy collective forecast, I actually have been more pessimistic than my\ncolleagues. My forecast for GDP is below the central tendency, my forecast for unemployment is\nabove the central tendency, and my forecast for inflation is at the bottom of the range of the central\ntendency. My pessimism is rooted in an expectation of weakness in investment, net exports, and\ngovernment spending. That weakness is driven in part by concerns about economic and financial\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nconditions in Europe, combined with restrained state and federal government spending as the U.S.\n(like many other countries) grapples with large budget deficits.\nIn particular, my discussions with bankers, exporters, and business managers indicate more\nrestraint by firms in investing in capital, and in hiring employees, as the firms wait for some of the\neconomic uncertainty to be resolved. However, a quick resolution for European sovereign debt\nconcerns and banking problems may remain elusive,3 and the same for the large deficit problems in\nmany countries. This suggests that slow growth is likely to continue for quite some time.\nFigure 2 shows business fixed investment in the United States during the most recent four\nquarters. As you can see, with concerns over Europe heating up in the last two quarters, business\nfixed investment has slowed. Firms have become more tentative, which I expect will, unfortunately,\ncontinue. One reason for my pessimism is the recent weakness in orders for capital goods, for\nexample aircraft.\nIndicating just how weak employment has been, Figure 3 compares the monthly change in\nU.S. employment during the most recent and past three recoveries. As you can see, compared to the\naverage of the last three recoveries, employment data have come in quite weak. Employment growth\nis slower now – in the third year of recovery – than it has been at the same point in any of the\nprevious three recoveries. In fact, just in the past three months employment growth in the U.S. has\nslowed fairly noticeably. Admittedly, the rate of growth is just one facet of the employment situation\n– employment-level comparisons are important, and currently sobering. I will turn to that a bit later,\nbut for now will just observe that these growth rate indicators are not a positive sign. Apparently,\nfirms have become more tentative in the face of growing global economic uncertainties. The\nslowdown in employment growth not only hinders our ability to get to full employment, but also\nweakens the consumer side of the economy even more, going forward. This suggests a self-fulfilling\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\ndynamic at work as concern over a potentially significant slowdown in the future reduces current\ngrowth, as firms invest less capital and hire fewer workers than they would in the absence of these\nuncertainties.\n\nBanking Interconnectedness\nGiven my concerns that economic growth will disappoint, what are the implications for global\nbanking? I would highlight first the high degree of interconnectedness between and among global\nbanks, particularly among U.S. and European banks. In New England, where I reside, three of the\nfive largest banks active in the region are foreign – from the U.K., Canada, and Spain. This is not just\na New England feature, as foreign and in particular European banks are very active in both retail and\nwholesale markets throughout the United States.\nFigure 4 lists the ten largest foreign banking organizations in the United States by total U.S.\nassets. Five are European banks, three are Canadian, and two are Japanese. Several of the largest\nbanking organizations have subsidiaries that have substantial retail franchises in the United States. In\naddition, the total assets of branches and agencies of three of the banks exceed $100 billion, likely\nindicating very significant “wholesale” operations, since most branches and agencies have virtually\nno retail deposit accounts in the United States because they cannot be FDIC insured.\nWhile several Japanese banks have had a significant presence in the United States, their role\nhas diminished over the past 15 years. And no other Asian banks are among the largest banks\noperating in the U.S.\nFigure 5 presents the assets of the ten largest U.S. broker-dealers owned by foreign banking\norganizations. The chart shows that European firms have a very significant presence in the United\nStates. The six largest foreign-owned broker-dealers are all European, and all have assets over $100\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nbillion. These foreign-owned broker-dealers provide a variety of market-making and underwriting\nactivity. This means that many European banks are highly interconnected with the U.S. financial\nsystem. Again, with the exception of one Japanese bank, the Asian bank presence in the U.S. is not\nnearly as significant as the European presence.\nFigure 6 plots some broad stock indices for the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan. The indices\nfor the U.S. and Europe move very closely together throughout the crisis period – and while they\ncontinue to move closely together, more recently the European index has drifted lower. In contrast,\nwhile all the stock indices experienced sharp declines in the fall of 2008, over time the Asian indices\nare generally not as tightly connected with those of the U.S. and Europe.\nFigure 7 plots the 26-week trailing correlation of U.S. and European stock index returns over\nthe last six years. The chart shows a very high and consistent correlation between the stock indices,\nindicating a very close link between U.S. and European markets. Figure 8 plots the 26-week trailing\ncorrelation of the returns of U.S. and European bank stocks. They too show a high degree of\ncorrelation, which has remained relatively stable. Given the close trade and financial ties between the\nU.S. and Europe, this may not be surprising.\nEuropean stocks were badly impacted by the financial shock from the U.S. during the last\nfinancial crisis. Were there to be a serious financial shock from Europe, these correlations suggest it\nis quite likely that it would have a large impact on financial stocks and the broader stock market in the\nUnited States. Such stock price declines could impact households and businesses on both sides of the\nAtlantic, and problems in Europe could potentially cause a more significant retrenchment by\nEuropean financial institutions operating in the United States.4\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nWhat about Asia?\nAs I mentioned earlier, historically Asian banks have not been as integrated with the United\nStates as European banks. While Asian banks have certainly been impacted by the global slowdown\nand reduction in international trade, their lesser degree of interconnectedness compared to European\nbanks means one might not expect to see as tight a link to financial problems emanating from the\nUnited States for Asian banks.\nFigures 9 and 10 show the correlations between U.S. large (global) bank stock returns and\nthose of Japan and China. During the early stages of the financial crisis in 2007, there was a very low\ncorrelation between bank stock returns in the United States and Asia. However, that correlation has\nrisen over time, although it still remains below the correlation between U.S. and European global\nbanks.\nFigures 11 and 12 show the correlations between European bank stock returns and those of\nglobal banks in Japan and China. They also have been rising over time. These rising stock return\ncorrelations may in part reflect a rising degree of interconnectedness between Asian financial\ninstitutions and their U.S. and European counterparts over the last six years.\nThe Bank for International Settlements provides data that highlight why the correlations may\nbe increasing. Figure 13 shows that U.S. and U.K. banks have been increasing their presence in Asia\nand that other European banks have significant exposures as well.5,6\nTurning to exposures to Europe, Figure 14 shows that U.S. banks have increased their claims7\nin Europe. This raises the possibility that the correlation between returns in the U.S. and Europe\ncould be nearly as tight in the event of a European disruption as they proved to be during the U.S.\nfinancial crisis. Only Japan and Taiwan currently provide data on foreign claims in Europe, but they\nalso are at relatively high levels. It should be noted that both in this graph and the previous, the\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\nconversion of two investment banks into bank holding companies causes a significant break in the\nU.S. series in the first quarter of 2009 – most noticeable on Figure 14 where there is a sharp increase\nin that period. Nonetheless, even after accounting for that break, the trend is the same, and the level\nof exposure is quite high.\nIn sum, while Asian banks did not have a high correlation with U.S. and European bank stock\nreturns during 2007 and early 2008, Asian banks are likely to be more impacted now should a\nsignificant shock occur in Europe. European bank presence in Asia has been rising, and Japan and\nTaiwan have relatively large claims in Europe.8 In short, I would say that as interconnectedness\nincreases globally, it will be difficult for any one region to insulate itself from financial strains or\ncrises elsewhere in the world.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would note that recent data have been consistent with a\nslowdown in economic activity in many parts of the world. This likely reflects a widespread concern\nthat global trade may be disrupted if there is an international financial shock, and that businesses are\npostponing hiring and investment decisions until the global outlook is more certain.\nWhile a large financial shock would impact the global economy, global banks have the\npotential to amplify that shock. While Asian global banks’ stock returns were not highly correlated\nwith those of U.S. and European global banks in the last crisis, the correlation has been on the rise\nover the past six years. Beyond the obvious trade impact if problems were to get worse in Europe, the\nconcern is increased due to financial markets and global banks becoming more interconnected.\nFigure 15 compares employment from its pre-recession peak in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\nWhile U.S. employment has been gradually increasing during the recovery, it remains well below the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, July 8, 2012\nand 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday, July 9, 2012 – or Upon Delivery\n\npre-recession peak. While the declines in Europe and Japan were not as dramatic, there has been little\nimprovement overall in the employment situation during the recovery. Given global employment and\nfiscal challenges, the global economy remains quite vulnerable to financial shocks. This vulnerability\nhighlights why it is particularly important at this time to reduce the probability, and mitigate the\nseverity, of any potential financial shock.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThat is, macroprudential in addition to just microprudential supervision.\n\n2\n\nAnd, of course, be impacted by.\n\n3\n\nEncouraging signs did emerge in the last ten days. As The New York Times reported, “This week’s economic summit\namong European leaders has exceeded expectations. New ground has been broken in an agreement that would allow\nEurope’s joint rescue funds to be used to recapitalize struggling banks in European Union member states and that would\nestablish a single bank supervisory mechanism under the European Central Bank.” June 29, 2012:\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html?_r=1&ref=world\n4\n\nOf course, the patterns of exposure in European versus U.S. banks would have an impact on how such a retrenchment\nplayed out. European banks clearly held mortgage-related assets and other assets that were sensitive to U.S. disruption.\nThe degree and manner in which U.S. banks hold assets that would be sensitive to European disruption could differ.\nHowever, later in this talk I discuss correlation and with Figure 14 I note that U.S. claims on European assets have risen.\n5\n\nIt also highlights that European banks have larger overall claims in Asia than U.S. banks.\n\n6\n\nAmong European countries, the U.K. has been increasing its presence in Asia, while other European countries have\nreduced their presence. Among European countries, the U.K. presence is slightly higher than that of the rest of Europe\ncombined.\n7\n\nClaims include loans, securities holdings, and equity holdings, and reflect the bank’s foreign exposure to that country.\nClaims include exposures held in the home country bank, as well as those held in branches or subsidiaries in the host\ncountry.\n8\n\nOne major transmission mechanism for a European financial shock would be through contagion associated with the\nassessment of risk in general. A significant rise in the risk spreads in the U.S. need not be a bank phenomenon (it could\njust be rising common exposures – everyone at risk is increasingly at risk from a global downturn), but it could have large\nreal effects.\n\n9\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nKeynote Remarks,\nConference on Post-Crisis Banking*\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\nJune 29, 2012\n*Conference sponsored by the Dutch Central Bank, the European\nBanking Center at Tilberg University, and the University of Kansas\nSchool of Business; in affiliation with the Journal of\nMoney, Credit, and Banking\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be invited to speak at the Dutch Central Bank and to be introduced\nby Klaas Knot. I had the pleasure of working with Klaas on a variety of issues related to the Basel\nAccord, and also had the opportunity to spend some time as a visiting scholar at the Dutch Central\nBank, which provided a wonderful opportunity to interact with Klaas and his colleagues on a variety\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nof research topics. I am happy for the opportunity to discuss how problems in financial markets and\nat financial intermediaries can spill over into the real economy, especially at a central bank that has\nhad a longstanding interest in these issues.\nAs always, I should note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(the FOMC).\nSince the severe financial stresses of 2008, a variety of actions have been taken to strengthen\nthe financial infrastructure and make banks more resilient in the face of adverse shocks. While many\nbanks have improved their capital and liquidity positions since 2008, we still see in the headlines of\nnewspapers around the world that financial stability remains very much an issue.\nIn some ways, central bankers must approach the issue of financial stability much like a\nstructural engineer. Where are the potential stresses in the system? Under what circumstances could\nthose stresses be particularly problematic? Most importantly, what remedial actions could reduce the\npossibility of an unstable outcome?\nToday I want to highlight an area where remedial action is still required. My goal is to focus\nmore attention on financial structures that by design or reality1 reduce or avoid capital charges – what\nis often called engaging in “capital arbitrage.” Such structures are vulnerable to stresses that can have\ndestabilizing effects on financial markets and the broader economy. After some introductory\ncomments about financial structures with inadequate capital, I will touch on two specific areas that\nmerit consideration – money market mutual funds sponsored by banking organizations, and brokerdealer financing.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThe Social Costs of Financial Structures with Inadequate Capital\nHolding little or no capital for risky activities can, during good times, generate significant\nprofits; even in relatively low-margin businesses. However, during times of stress, the power of\nleverage works in reverse, amplifying the negative impact of risky activities and necessitating\nsubstantial capital and liquidity at a time when both are in short supply.\nThese problems become compounded in episodes when the inadequacy of capital becomes\napparent in the marketplace. Investors who normally fund these structures, very often via short-term\nlending, flee – and they also flee financial institutions that are perceived to stand behind these\nstructures (sponsoring institutions, which I will discuss in a moment). In this way, the capital\narbitrage that motivated the risky structures could contribute to a liquidity strain on what has come to\nbe known as the shadow banking system, and could stress the financial institutions that were integral\nto its creation. The reason we care about this is that such an episode often produces instability in\nimportant channels for funding real economic activity – so these Wall Street concerns can have Main\nStreet impacts.2\nStructured investment vehicles or “SIVs” illustrated this dynamic very well. Financial\ninstitutions created SIVs as off-balance-sheet structures that were financed with short-term liabilities\nbut frequently invested in longer-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities.3 The associated\ncredit and interest-rate risk became apparent, as losses from these assets rose. Investors were no\nlonger willing to purchase the short-term paper issued by these structures. Consequently, many\nfinancial institutions, as a result of implicit or explicit guarantees, were forced to bring these assets\nonto their balance sheet – where they were often subject to more significant capital requirements.\nThis led to substantial losses, balance sheet expansion, and a shortage of capital – all of which\nhindered the meeting of funding needs in the real economy.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nFortunately, the riskiest and most opaque structures of this sort have largely disappeared from\nthe marketplace. But problematic structures still remain.\nRuns on complex securitizations, prime money market mutual funds, and investment banks all\ncontributed to the severity of the 2008 crisis. Compounding the problem, the investment bank\nstructures were built on an assumption that runs were unlikely as long as lenders held collateral\nagainst their loans. In the depths of the crisis, however, lenders realized that relying on collateral\ncould leave them with securities that they did not wish to hold – or in some cases that they were not\neven legally allowed to hold.4 When large losses on subprime mortgage assets and complex products\namplified uncertainty about the value of collateral, investors ran – even though they held\ncollateralized positions.\nDespite the lessons provided by the crisis, there remain a variety of financial structures that are\n“capital efficient” from the perspective of market participants, but in my view continue to be\nsusceptible to strains on short-term funding during times of financial market stress or crisis.\nI will argue today that one way to address these structures is to make them the focus of stress\ntests that result in meaningful decisions about capital adequacy. Continuing the structural engineer\nanalogy, the stress tests can be helpful much in the way that structural engineers test the resilience of\ndifferent designs against modeled events like earthquakes and storms. Banking organizations that\nsponsor so-called capital-efficient structures should conduct stress tests that include a focus on\nwhether these structures will require support during periods of severe market or idiosyncratic stress,\nand what the impact would be on the organization at that time. This might lead financial institutions\nto be more attentive to these undercapitalized structures, consistent with institutions focusing on the\namount of capital required to survive stressed conditions – rather than the capital needed strictly to\nsatisfy regulatory requirements.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBy using stress tests to identify the possible capital and liquidity demands from these\nstructures during a crisis, the institution’s management, board of directors, and regulators can better\ndetermine the appropriateness of the structures and the associated capital and liquidity – and whether\nthese structures are likely to be beneficial to the organization at all times, or only during good times.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Funds Sponsored by Banking Organizations\n\nAs an example, I want to highlight money market mutual fund sponsors in the United States.\nSpecifically, I will discuss the possibility of using stress tests to illuminate the impact of various\nscenarios on fund sponsors, many of which are banks or financial institutions.\nMy primary focus will be on prime money market mutual funds, with approximately $1.41\ntrillion in total assets as of May 31.5 Prime funds invest in a variety of securities that carry more\ncredit risk than traditional U.S. Treasury securities.6 Money market mutual funds allow investors to\npotentially earn a higher return on short-term investments in part because – unlike banks – money\nmarket mutual funds are not required to hold capital. As a result, they often pay a competitive rate\nrelative to bank deposits, and they provide investors many features similar to traditional bank deposits\n– for example, immediate availability of funds as well as a fixed net asset value that does not fluctuate\nwhen the value of assets held by the money fund changes.\nSo money market mutual funds provide investors with an investment vehicle with features like\nbank deposits – but the funds do not hold capital. The problem is that a financial intermediary –\nwhich has no capital, but takes credit risk, and provides under normal circumstances7 immediately\navailable funds at a fixed net asset value – may be inviting trouble. Such a fund can be susceptible if\nthe credit risk of the assets it invests in were to rise, causing investors to become concerned about the\nfund’s ability to sell its assets, meet redemption demands, and maintain a stable net asset value.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nConsequently, the implicit expectation of a bank-deposit-like investment can unravel, and the\nincentives to redeem could be strong.\nAs Figure 1 shows, when the Reserve Primary Fund could no longer provide a fixed net asset\nvalue to investors in the wake of the Lehman Brothers failure, investors ran not only from the Reserve\nPrimary Fund, but also from prime money market mutual funds in general. The top panel shows the\noutflows in the form of the daily changes in prime fund assets. It is particularly easy for investors to\nexit prime money market mutual funds, especially when they can easily redeem shares8 from a prime\nfund and invest the proceeds in a government-securities-only fund, even within the same fund family.\nAs is clear in Figure 1, the large outflow of funds from prime money market mutual funds was\naccompanied to a notable degree by an inflow of funds to government-only money market mutual\nfunds. This is shown in the bottom panel on the figure.\nWhile the funds may remain in the same fund family with this shift, investors who do not exit\nfrom the prime money market mutual fund could be financially impacted,9 and the prime fund might\nneed to engage in a fire sale of assets to meet investor demands. Furthermore, firms counting on\nmoney market mutual funds to provide funding (for example by buying their debt – their commercial\npaper) can suddenly find that the primary purchasers of their paper are no longer active in the\nmarket.10\nFacing all this in 2008, as well as the damage to credit flows and eventually economic activity\nin general, the U.S. Treasury responded to the run on prime money market mutual funds by providing\ninsurance, and the Federal Reserve created a lending facility designed to provide liquidity to money\nmarket mutual funds.11 Questions remain as to whether support could or would be possible today,\ngiven changes ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOur concerns should be amplified by the fact that many prime funds are sponsored by\ndepository institutions or their affiliates. Figure 2 shows the breakdown of prime money market\nmutual funds (by percent of assets and by number of funds) by category of sponsor. Just under half\nthe assets are held in funds sponsored by an asset manager not affiliated with a depository institution.\nBut domestic (U.S.) bank holding companies, foreign bank holding companies, and savings and loan\nholding companies (in other words companies affiliated with depository institutions) combined serve\nas the sponsoring organizations for a bit more than half the prime fund assets, and more than half of\nthe number of funds.\nWhile SEC regulations restrict the credit risk and maturity risk of prime money market mutual\nfund investments, these funds nonetheless can and do invest in risky assets. An example is provided\nby the number and value of Dexia obligations held by money market mutual funds at the end of 2010,\nless than one year before the Belgian and French governments needed to bail out the bank.\nAs Figure 3 shows, a large number of money market mutual funds with various types of\nsponsors held Dexia paper at the beginning of the year in which Dexia failed. However, funds\nsponsored by banks or bank affiliates were over-weighted relative to funds sponsored by asset\nmanagement firms not affiliated with a bank, both in the number of funds invested in Dexia and the\nvalue of Dexia assets.\nParticularly notable is the number of foreign-bank-sponsored money market mutual funds with\nexposure to Dexia. While money funds unloaded their Dexia holdings before the government bailout,\nthere was a noteworthy willingness to hold the obligations of a troubled large financial intermediary\nthat had widely known problems – perhaps because many expected it to receive government support\nin the event of distress. This is similar to what happened with the Lehman failure – when such\nexpectations turned out to be quite wrong.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nAs recent studies have highlighted, it is quite common for money market mutual funds that\nhave impaired assets to obtain support from their sponsors.12 Whether this is a cash infusion or a\npurchase at face value of an impaired asset,13 this support can represent draws on capital14 at times\nwhen the sponsoring organization is facing other capital pressures.\nFigure 4 shows support-related losses by fund sponsors, using data provided by Moody’s and\nbroken down by sponsor type. Moody’s data capture losses attributed to money market mutual funds\nthat are disclosed on the sponsoring company’s financial statements.15 Note that depository\ninstitution sponsors had significant losses during 2008, a time when many depository institutions were\nalready facing significant capital and liquidity pressures.\nWhile most of the losses were during stressful times, even during non-stressful times there are\nsome losses. Figure 5 sums the losses recognized over the five-year period of 2007 to 2011. The\ndegree of sponsor support is substantial. Support has been quite large and particularly prevalent for\nprime money market mutual funds which have depository institution or depository institution\naffiliated sponsors. Over this period, Moody’s reports almost $9 billion in losses associated with\nmoney market mutual funds by depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors.\nThe SEC has been working on reform proposals that would provide several measures to\nreduce the risk of stresses during times of financial market crisis and provide some capital support.16\nI am very supportive of the current push within the SEC for additional reforms, which have the\npotential of mitigating many of the concerns I am sharing today. As the primary regulator of money\nfunds, the SEC is in a position to adopt rules that would address the vulnerabilities of those funds\nmore comprehensively, effectively, and efficiently than other approaches. However, at this time it is\nunclear what the final proposal will be, or whether the SEC’s final proposal will be adopted.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nIn the absence of such reforms for all money market mutual funds, an alternative for funds\nwith depository institution or depository institution affiliated sponsors would be to include likely\nmoney market mutual fund support in the sponsor’s stress tests. Based on the historical experience of\ntheir money market funds, the historical experience of similar funds, and their money market funds’\nexposures, sponsors could calculate the likely capital support needed from the organization in a stress\nscenario.\nAgain, this is an admittedly partial approach, in the absence of more comprehensive reforms\nthat I hope will occur. But this approach would at least make more banking organizations more\nresilient (it would not be just money market mutual fund structures that would need capital – any\nfinancial structure that broke down during stress would need more capital) but it would also make\nclearer to money market mutual fund investors that banks had capital that could support funds during\nstressful periods. It would thus make clear that money market mutual funds with well capitalized\nsponsors are likely to be less risky than those that do not have well capitalized sponsors.\nSimilarly, other financial products that circumvent standard capital requirements – such as non\n2a-7 “money market like” funds, stable value wrap products, and asset-backed commercial paper –\ncould lead investors to expect that the sponsor holds capital for the support that these products could\nneed in times of stress. While some firms are likely to argue they would not provide support for socalled capital efficient products, the high frequency of support of money market mutual funds and\nother off-balance-sheet items during the crisis makes such claims dubious.\nIn fact, this support might be encouraged by regulators during a crisis, in order to avoid\nbroader problems of financial instability. U.S. banking regulators have17 tacitly acknowledged that\nbank holding companies may provide such support, subject to limitations identified in Figure 6.18\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBroker-Dealer Financing\nAllow me now to turn to a second area for consideration. What we call broker-dealer\nfinancing became particularly problematic during the financial crisis. With the failure of Bear Stearns\nand Lehman, it became apparent that broker-dealers, like traditional depository institutions, could be\nvulnerable to stresses during times of crisis.\nFor depository institutions, of course, concerns over the potential for runs have led to\nsignificant regulations to reduce their likelihood. During the Great Depression, runs on banks created\nbanking panics that resulted in large losses for depositors and a significant reduction in credit – and\nthose difficult episodes led to a variety of regulations to make runs on banks less likely. The creation\nof deposit insurance reduced the incentive for insured depositors to run during periods of financial\nstress, and mitigated the sharp reduction in credit availability that accompanies large deposit outflows\nfrom banks. In addition, in the U.S. (and some other countries) depository institutions have access to\nthe central bank’s “lender of last resort” credit facilities, which are intended to provide liquidity but\nnot protection from insolvency. Deposit insurance and the lender of last resort function assist banks in\nproviding one of their fundamental services – transforming short-term deposits into longer-term\nassets, since the risk of a sudden need to liquidate assets to meet unexpected outflows of deposits is\ngreatly diminished.\nBroker-dealers in the United States have not had the benefit of similar regulatory protections.\nThey do not typically have access to central bank lending, and they do not have insurance that reduces\nthe risk of unexpected outflows. Instead, broker-dealers rely on collateralized arrangements that\nallow them to be market makers, under the assumption that wholesale creditors will be comfortable\nproviding funds as long as there is sufficient collateral backing them. In addition, banks that are part\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nof larger bank holding companies are subject to Section 23 A and B restrictions designed to protect\nthe deposit insurance fund from providing support to non-bank affiliates, including broker-dealers.\nFigure 7 details the direct access that broker-dealers have to central bank credit in various\njurisdictions as well as constraints to indirect access through affiliated banks. It shows the differences\nacross countries in providing liquidity to broker-dealers from the central bank or from bank affiliates.\nIn both Switzerland and Japan, broker-dealers do have access to liquidity facilities at the central bank.\nHowever, it is not unusual to place limitations on the ability of bank affiliates to provide liquidity to\ntheir broker dealer affiliates as countries seek to avoid or limit having deposit insurance funds\nexposed to non-bank affiliate activities.\nFigure 8 summarizes the average composition of the balance sheets of large bank holding\ncompanies with high and low concentrations of broker-dealer activities. The figure highlights the\nvery different asset-liability mix, on average, of bank holding companies that have sizeable brokerdealer operations compared to those that do not. A traditional depository institution has loans as the\nprimary asset class, and core deposits as the primary liability category. The loans and certain\nsecurities held can serve as collateral for potential discount window borrowings, and deposit\ninsurance limits the incentive for insured depositors to run.\nIn contrast, bank holding companies with a relatively high concentration of broker-dealer\nactivity tend to hold more assets that are liquid and invest in highly marketable securities that can be\nrefinanced through repurchase agreements – since broker-dealer operations cannot be funded by\ninsured deposits. In short, you see greater use of short-term, non-deposit funding sources at the bank\nholding companies with high concentrations of broker-dealer activity.\nDuring the financial crisis in 2008, the difficulty in maintaining collateralized funding\nprompted the introduction of a primary dealer credit facility at the Federal Reserve. This facility\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nprovided a way for broker-dealers to obtain short-term funding for their marketable securities because\nthey otherwise did not have direct access to the Fed’s discount window.\nGiven the potential liquidity challenges to broker-dealer financing during periods of great\nstress, many broker-dealers have bolstered their regulatory capital and adjusted the composition of\ntheir balance sheet. Figure 9 shows that bank holding companies with large broker-dealer affiliates\nhave been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital ratios and holding more Tier 1 common\nequity capital than bank holding companies with less of a concentration in broker-dealer activities\n(although they have also been increasing their Tier 1 common equity capital). Figure 10 shows that\nthe improvement in capital is less dramatic when using a leverage ratio measure of capital that does\nnot reflect a shift to lower risk-weighted assets.\nMarkets are sensitive to the differences in these risk profiles. Figure 11 shows how stock\nprices of bank holding companies were impacted during three elevated stress periods – the fall of\n2008, the fall of 2011, and the first part of this year. The chart shows that during stress periods, bank\nholding companies with a low concentration in broker-dealer activities had less stock price response\nto the stress periods than institutions with greater concentrations in broker-dealer activities.\nOne way to assess the increased market sensitivity of bank holding companies might be to\nmodel in stress tests how a sudden shortage of liquidity might impact broker-dealer operations, and\ndetermine the capital implications. Potentially, broker-dealers could be structured in such a way that\nliquidity facilities would not be necessary for broker-dealers during times of financial stress.\nHowever, if a stress test highlights the benefits to those firms of having additional capital or\nmore liquid assets, it should also take into account the costs involved. Firms might be less willing to\nmake markets in less liquid assets or might shrink their balance sheets to meet higher capital\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nrequirements, and thus reduce market-making activities in potentially important sectors of financial\nmarkets.\nAn alternative would be to develop a framework where, under certain conditions, liquidity\nfacilities would be regularly made available for broker-dealers during periods of high stress. This\narrangement would recognize that, like more traditional depositories, broker-dealers are subject to\nilliquidity in markets, and their reaction to that illiquidity can exacerbate the problem.\nFrom a public policy perspective, the rationale for promoting market functioning during times\nof stress is that liquidity strains and other stresses at market makers, like the matter of runs on\ndepositories, can have a broader impact on the overall economy. However, more analytical work\nneeds to be done to better understand broker-dealer activities during times of stress, as well as the\npotential costs and benefits of alternatives for addressing the potential for stresses at broker-dealers.19\nAt a minimum, stress tests that focus on the behavior of broker-dealers and their counterparties during\ntimes of stress should be undertaken and their implications well understood.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would note that a major innovation that resulted from the financial crisis was\nincreased attention to stress tests. The stress tests provide an opportunity for banking organization\nmanagement teams, boards of directors, investors, and regulators to better understand the impact of\nstressful financial conditions. Increasing the focus of stress tests beyond safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions to more systemic concerns and implications — such as how markets and\ninstitutions behave during periods of stress — is an under-researched area that deserves more\nattention. These are the relatively early stages of understanding how best to conduct stress tests, and\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nwhat the implications of those tests should be for financial institutions. This is, and will continue to\nbe, an iterative process.\nI have highlighted two areas where more work needs to be done. The first is to provide more\nfocus on financial structures that were designed to be “capital efficient.” Such structures can be major\nstress points in the financial infrastructure. Using stress tests to better understand the implications of\nundercapitalized financial structures will take time, but needs to be better integrated into frameworks\nfor managing and supervising institutions. Money market mutual funds with bank or bank affiliated\nsponsors provide one example, especially because there has been a pattern of support for money\nmarket mutual funds without an explicit recognition that such funds can be a capital drain during\ntimes of stress.\nA second area that deserves more attention is the behavior and resilience of broker-dealer\narrangements during times of financial stress. While the role of depositories and their susceptibility to\nruns has received much attention, I believe more work needs to be done on the implications of\npotential crisis-related stresses at broker-dealers that do not have access to liquidity facilities.\nUtilizing stress tests to better understand vulnerabilities should help inform us about ways to enhance\nfinancial stability.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I look forward to our continued\nprogress on these important issues of financial stability – which, as we have learned, can impact the\nreal economy and all its participants.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nIn the case of money market mutual funds, the initial motivation of the design was to provide investors a way\nto avoid Regulation Q restrictions. In practice, the money market mutual fund structure also has what some\nwould see as a competitive benefit – holding no capital while banks did need to hold capital. Thus, even after\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 29, 2012 at 7:00 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time and 1:00 PM in Amsterdam – or Upon Delivery *\n\nRegulation Q restrictions no longer applied, money market mutual funds remained an alternative to deposits in\nbanks.\n2\n\n3\n\nFor more information see prior speeches including the following:\n•\n\n“Remarks for a Panel Discussion of the Global Outlook and Risks” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/060712/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Money Market Mutual Funds and Financial Stability” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/041112/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Avoiding Complacency: The U.S. Economic Outlook, and Financial Stability” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2012/032712/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Global Financial Intermediaries: Lessons and Continuing Challenges” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/101911/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Towards Greater Financial Stability in Short-Term Credit Markets” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/092911/index.htm\n\n•\n\n“Defining Financial Stability, and Some Policy Implications of Applying the Definition” –\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm\n\nIn other words, engaged in credit intermediation and maturity transformation.\n\n4\n\nSee the recent speech by Federal Reserve Board Governor Daniel Tarullo, who noted that “In addition, the\npresumed stabilizing function of collateral was weakened, since a default by a dealer or clearing bank could\nleave lenders with securities posted as collateral that they had no desire, operational capacity, or even, in some\ncases, legal authority to hold, or at least liquidate in an orderly way.” See “Shadow Banking After the\nFinancial Crisis” available on the Board’s website at the following link:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20120612a.htm.\n\n5\n\nSource: iMoneyNet data\n\n6\n\nFor example, prime money market funds have a significant exposure to short-term debt instruments of\nEuropean banks.\n\n7\n\nIt should be noted that the money market fund industry discloses that investments may lose value and are not\ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n8\n\nMMMF investors are shareholders, not depositors.\n\n9\n\nFor example, heavy redemption pressures may force fire sales of assets that depress net asset values or\nconcentrate losses over a shrinking number of shares.\n\n10\n\nThe Investment Company Institute notes that “money market funds hold more than one-third of corporate\ncommercial paper.” A paper by Sergey Chernenko and Adi Sunderam describes this impact on borrowers of\nmoney market funds in 2011.

In addition, a forthcoming white\npaper detailing our analysis of sponsor support is expected to be published this summer by the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston.\n13\n\nThe purchase could be actual or promised. The Boston Fed used actual purchases in its analysis, to be\nconservative. Other studies (such as Moody’s) have also noted promised purchases or guarantees.\n\n14\n\nEven guarantees, which may require no initial cash outlay, result in a recorded liability on the books of the\nsponsor and an associated reduction in sponsor capital.\n\n15\n\nSource: Moody's. Data for the period August 2007 to December 2011 obtained from public disclosures,\neither at the fund level or holding company level (ultimate sponsor).

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAt the Institute of International Finance\nSpring Membership Meeting\nJune 7, 2012\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nI have been asked to briefly discuss the risks to the economic and financial outlook.1 In\nsome sense, this is much easier than the jobs assigned to other panelists tasked with forecasting the\noutlook for either financial markets or the real economy. At a time when some of the risk scenarios\nare increasingly seeping into relevance, forecasting the most likely outcome can be quite difficult.\nRisks that one year ago were viewed as so-called “tail-risk events” are increasingly being\nintegrated into many peoples’ base forecasts. This shift highlights that risks are once again on the\nrise, and that uncertainty about some of the challenges facing the global economy is already\nimpacting the economic behavior of households and businesses.\n\n1\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on\nthe Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\nSuch uncertainty is leading to a degree of risk aversion that becomes apparent when we look\nat 10-year government bond rates in the U.S., U.K., and Germany (Figure 1). In all three countries,\n10-year government bond rates are well below the inflation targets of their respective central banks.\nThe fact that 10-year government bonds are trading at well below 2 percent indicates that perceived\nrisks are leaving investors willing to purchase an asset that would provide a negative real return for\n10 years (assuming that central banks are successful in hitting their inflation targets). For investors\nto view this pricing as reasonable implies that rising inflation is not a prime concern of financial\nmarket participants. It seems investors believe that central banks are more likely to undershoot their\ninflation targets than overshoot them, and that policymakers need to be particularly attentive to the\ndownside risks of their economic and financial outlooks – and examine how best to mitigate these\nrisks.\nSome analysts have focused on direct exposures of financial institutions to a particular\ngeographic location as a measure of current risk exposures. I would say that such measures do not\ncapture the true risks. For example, in 2008 signs of potential disruption in financial intermediation\nactivity and liquidity were a much better gauge of the financial and economic risks building up in\nthe system than were measures of direct exposure to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. While it took many\nmonths for sub-prime credit losses to materialize, sources of short-term funding dried up well in\nadvance, providing a timelier indicator of underlying stresses than measures of credit exposure.\nThis episode highlights the risk that remains today to any institution that relies heavily on shortterm funding to finance its business, and suggests that monitoring stresses in short-term funding\nmarkets may provide better early indications of troubles to come.\nIn 2008, many financial institutions learned that strategies of capital arbitrage, often in the\nform of holding assets off-balance sheet to avoid capital charges, were profitable during good times\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\nbut were recipes for disaster during times of financial stress. Those structures quickly lost the\nconfidence of counterparties who had been funding them, and thus became a significant problem to\nfinancial institutions. Fortunately, some of the most egregious structures, like certain structured\ninvestment vehicles (SIVs), have been wound down.\nFurthermore, many financial institutions have taken measures over the past several years to\nbolster capital and liquidity. However, we – banks and regulators – need to understand better how\nfunding models and investment structures are likely to behave under severe stress. Our best way to\nlearn more about that is through ongoing stress tests. Such tests should focus on undercapitalized\nstructures, or structures that are sufficiently opaque or risky that they are likely to require significant\ncapital or liquidity at a time when they are particularly expensive.\nFinancial institutions and their regulators must make continued progress in reducing the\ninstitutions’ sensitivity to rapid changes in risk preferences, and the consequences of such shifts for\nfunding the assets of many institutions. In recent years and recent weeks, such shifts have pulled\nfunders out of many risky investments and into the lowest-risk financial vehicles – most often the\nsovereign debt of the safest countries. This dynamic lies behind the recent surge in demand for\nU.S., U.K., and German bonds. The financial system remains quite vulnerable to this rapid\nshrinkage of funding sources.\nA second significant risk is that a failure to decisively resolve banking problems could cause\ncollateral damage to the global economy. Historically, Japan is probably the leading example of\nhow the failure to aggressively address banking problems can yield serious collateral damage. A\nprotracted period of deleveraging of bank balance sheets, coupled with a persistent pattern of\nallocating capital to defer the realization of unavoidable losses, can cause an extended period of\nsignificantly misallocated resources. Such misallocation hoards scarce funds in inefficient\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL\nThursday, June 7, 2012 at 5:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 11:30 a.m. in Copenhagen, Denmark – or Upon Delivery\n\ninvestments and siphons them away from profitable and productive new investment opportunities.\nThe combination of a banking system in denial, with business and households that are constrained\nby deleveraging and risk-avoidance, helps explain why recessions that are accompanied by financial\ncrises are often deeper and slower to recover.\nThe global economy remains at risk. The longer the risks I have highlighted remain\nunaddressed, the more that investors, financial institutions, households, and businesses will shift\nwhat they considered tail risks into their expected outcomes. In this way, concerns about the\npossibility of future problems cause a substantial reduction in current economic growth.\nPolicymakers and financial institutions need to continue to improve the robustness of the financial\nsystem in order to minimize the impact of this uncertainty.\nThank you for inviting me to join this panel today.\n\nFigure 1\nTen-Year Government Bond Yields\nApril 24, 2012 - June 4, 2012\n\nPercent\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nGermany\n\n1.0\n24-Apr-2012\n\n01-May-2012\n\n08-May-2012\n\n15-May-2012\n\n22-May-2012\n\n29-May-2012\n\nSource: U.S. Treasury, Financial Times / Haver Analytics\n\n4\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Worcester Regional Research Bureau’s\n27th Annual Meeting\nWorcester, Massachusetts\nMay 30, 2012\n\nI would like to thank Ralph Crowley, both for his kind introduction and for his\nservice as chair of the Boston Fed’s New England Advisory Council – a group that plays\na valued role, providing us with perspectives on business conditions facing small and\nmedium-sized companies around New England. Advisory councils like the one Ralph\nchairs provide information and perspectives that help us at the Fed interpret trends in the\neconomic data.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI have been in your city a number of times in recent years, but the last time I gave\na speech in Worcester specifically on the economic outlook, like today, it was at the\nWorcester Economic Club in May of 2009. The nation was really still in the midst of the\nfinancial crisis then, so it is wonderful to be speaking with you at a somewhat more\nfavorable time.\nWe have had 11 consecutive quarters of positive growth in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) since the economic recovery began, and the unemployment rate nationally\nhas declined from a peak of 10 percent to 8.1 percent in April. However, the economic\nrecovery and the improvement in the unemployment rate continue to be frustratingly\nslow. My outlook, unfortunately, is for growth right around its “potential” rate of\nbetween two and two-and-a-half percent – which implies no significant improvement in\nlabor markets over the course of this year. Of course I would add that all the views I\nexpress today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\nAnd even this modest pace of growth is contingent on some fairly significant\nassumptions – that Europe will be able to muddle through its current problems, and that\nin the United States the government will be able to reach agreements to avoid a so-called\n“fiscal cliff” looming at the end of this year. Under current law, at the end of 2012\ncertain factors – including the expiration of unemployment benefits and the payroll tax\ncut, revisions to the Alternative Minimum Tax, the expiration of the so-called “Bush tax\ncuts,” and sequestration (automatic spending cuts) associated with the Budget Control\nAct of 2011 – would together restrain growth by a significant fraction of GDP.1\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecent Economic Data\nI would note that there has been some positive news contained in recent economic\ndata. Figure 1 shows the improvements in two components of real GDP that are linked\nto households. Consumption grew 2.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, a rate that\nis faster than the previous three quarters and faster than the 2.2 percent growth of the\noverall economy. Similarly, residential investment grew 19.1 percent in the first quarter\nof this year, faster than the previous three quarters – and obviously well above the rate of\ngrowth in the overall economy.2\nThinking optimistically, the improvement in residential investment may finally be\nsignaling that the housing sector will not continue to be a source of significant restraint\non economic growth. However, my enthusiasm for a housing recovery is still moderated\n– by the evidence of challenges in obtaining housing finance, by the number of borrowers\nwho owe more than their house is worth, and by the still very elevated level of home\nforeclosures.\nIndeed, as Figure 2 shows, housing prices across the country are moving\ntogether, and are likely being restrained by similar headwinds, rather than principally\nreflecting regional trends. I would expect that as the housing sector improves along with\nthe national economy, regional differences would become prevalent and we would see a\nweaker correlation of housing prices across different regions of the country than we see\nto the far right in Figure 2.\nAnd while some sectors of the economy are improving, some significant\nheadwinds remain. Figure 3 shows two of them. Government spending has been\ndeclining,3 which regardless of your political views means, in the short term, less\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\naggregate demand and less growth in the economy. And without further action by\nCongress to avoid the “fiscal cliff” that I mentioned earlier, national fiscal policy has the\npotential to be a much bigger headwind to faster growth in the coming year.\nBusiness investment has also been slowing. While business investment was a\nsource of strength in the early stages of the recovery, companies have slowed investment\nspending more recently. To the extent that concerns over a possible worsening of future\nEuropean economic problems and a possible U.S. fiscal contraction make U.S. businesses\nmore tentative, these worries about the future can impede a more rapid recovery now.\nThis is a particularly difficult time to forecast the economy, given that significant\npolitical decisions can influence economic actions. To highlight why we should be\nhumble about our forecasting abilities, we need only look at the size of revisions to the\nGDP numbers shown in Figure 4. The chart highlights the significant uncertainty\nassociated with measures of recent economic growth. The blue dashed line plots the\nadvance estimates of real GDP growth. The data are revised in subsequent months as\nmore information becomes available, for example additional data on foreign trade and\ninventories. However, even those estimates can be significantly revised – see the red,\ngreen, and blue marks on the chart – once tax data and other information become\navailable to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. As the chart shows, it is not\nuncommon for the revised data to differ from the preliminary estimates of GDP by as\nmuch as a percentage point.\nGiven the difficulty in measuring even the recent past, it should not be too\nsurprising that estimates of the future are even more problematic. For example,\neconomic forecasters need to make assumptions about the fiscal measures likely to be\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntaken by European countries, some of which are facing elections with quite stark policy\nchoices represented by the candidates on the ballot. And forecasters need to make\nassumptions about fiscal policy in the United States, even though it goes without saying\nthat political choices made up and down the ballot by the U.S. electorate in the fall could\nlead to quite different policies.\nSince economists have no particular expertise in forecasting political results, they\nmake estimates based on modeling likely outcomes – which often assume only modest\ndivergence from the recent past. Despite the uncertainty inherent in them, these\neconomic forecasts are an important aspect of how monetary policy is set.\nAt the Fed, we are now producing and publicly disclosing the estimates of real\nGDP growth, unemployment, and PCE4 inflation rates produced by the FOMC\nparticipants5 in a Summary of Economic Projections. The central tendency6 of the\nFOMC participants’ estimated forecasts, and my own current forecast, are provided in\nFigure 5.\nYou can see that my own forecasts are a little more pessimistic than the central\ntendency of the participants at the April FOMC meeting. I am expecting growth of only\n2.3 percent for the full year, I’m sorry to say; and unfortunately no improvement in the\ncurrent U.S. unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. As you can see, I also expect both total\nPCE inflation and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent for 2012. My forecast of\nrelative weakness in the economy reflects concern that the uncertainty about both Europe\nand the U.S. federal “fiscal cliff” will restrain spending by households and businesses –\nbut it also assumes that Europe and our own fiscal situation achieve a “muddling\nthrough.”\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI would, however, highlight the uncertainty and downside risks to my forecast.\nOne downside risk is that European problems could become a much greater restraint on\ngrowth this year. Another downside risk is that Middle East problems could cause an oil\nsupply shock that negatively affects economic growth. And another is that much greater\nfiscal austerity could result from a potential failure to reach budget agreements.\nGiven my expectations of only modest growth, no improvement in the\nunemployment rate, an inflation forecast below 2 percent, and significant downside risks\nto the forecast, I believe monetary policy should remain accommodative at this time and\nindeed that we should be looking for ways that monetary policy can foster more rapid\ngrowth, to bring down the unemployment rate more quickly. I believe further monetary\npolicy accommodation is both appropriate and necessary. The U.S., like many other\ncountries, needs to facilitate a more rapid recovery, and monetary policy is one important\ntool with the potential still for encouraging faster growth.\n\nLabor Markets\nNow I’d like to focus in on labor markets. I remain especially concerned about\nthe ongoing weakness there. While most observers are concerned about labor market\nconditions, views differ on why unemployment remains so persistently and painfully\nhigh. Some believe there are structural reasons like shortages of specific skills, or labor\nshortages in specific geographic regions. If this argument were true, then the more\nstimulative monetary policy I am proposing might not be wise.\nBut I will present some analysis today that argues that most of the problem is in a\nlack of aggregate demand – in the parlance of economists, it is cyclical more than\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nstructural. This is not to dismiss entirely some structural components of the current high\nunemployment rate. Certainly there are situations where the skills of people who had lost\njobs were not well aligned with the skill sets needed in some sectors that are hiring, such\nas advanced manufacturing and health care. But I believe the evidence shows the bulk of\nthe problem is cyclical. Furthermore, my desire to stimulate more growth now is partly\nto prevent the structural problem from becoming more severe because the economy did\nnot re-employ workers more quickly.\nFigure 6 highlights that all census regions experienced a significant decline in\nemployment during the recent recession, and also that there is surprisingly little regional\nvariation during this modest recovery. The lines move together at the extreme right of\nthe chart, versus the earlier periods depicted on the rest of the chart. While recessions\ntend to impact all regions of the country simultaneously, recoveries are normally more\nvaried across regions. Differences in industrial composition and idiosyncratic variation\ncause regions to diverge as the recovery progresses.\nOne reason for the current similarity across regions is that two weak sectors, state\nand local government spending and residential investment, remain much weaker than is\nusual for this stage of a recovery, and have been impacting all regions of the country.\nThe similarity across regions also highlights that inadequate demand – rather than\nregional employment shortages in faster growing areas – is driving employment patterns.\nFigure 7 further illustrates this point. Nationally, the unemployment rate is 8.1\npercent, well above the unemployment rate in December 2007 before the onset of the\nrecession. In fact, all census regions have much higher unemployment rates than they did\nbefore the onset of the recession, and no region today has an unemployment rate that I\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwould see as consistent with full employment. Again, the state of affairs we see today is\nnot consistent with serious bottlenecks created by rapid growth in certain regions\npreventing further progress in labor markets.\nFigure 8 illustrates in rather stark terms how unusual this recovery has been. In\nthe previous three recoveries the previous peak in employment was reached within two\nyears of the start of the recovery. In the current recovery, which has already exceeded\ntwo years in length, employment still remains more than 3 percent lower than the peak\nprior to the recession. This is partly because the recovery has been slow, and partly\nbecause the employment decline was so large.\nFigure 9 shows the current recovery and also shows employment when the\nconstruction and government sectors are excluded (the dashed lines). These two sectors\nhave been unusually weak in this recovery – but even when these sectors are excluded,\nemployment is nowhere close to its previous peak. This highlights that employment\nweakness is not tied just to problems in specific sectors of the economy.\nFigure 10 shows employment growth across industries. This recession was\nunusual in how pervasive the decline was across industries, reflecting a very sharp drop\nin overall demand as businesses significantly retrenched, given the severity of the\ndownturn. Moreover, during the recovery the pattern has been similar across industries –\nwith a modest pickup in employment across industries but no industry standing out as\nhaving comparably rapid growth. Again this seems more reflective of inadequate\ndemand rather than structural impediments to growth, such as major industries being\nunable to find sufficient workers.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAnd if firms were having difficulty hiring, one would expect to see wages and\nsalaries rising in their industries. Figure 11 highlights that wages and salaries have been\ngrowing only slowly, and in most industries it is below two percent – consistent with\nweak labor demand in general. The tight bunching of wage and salary growth at low\nlevels in the recent period shown to the right of the chart does not give evidence that\ncertain industries are bidding up wages and salaries because of difficulty finding workers.\nThese employment and wage patterns are consistent with a very modest recovery\nin most industries and most regions of the country. Growth has been only modest\nnationally, and I believe we need substantially more growth if we want to achieve full\nemployment within a reasonable period of time.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe economy continues to recover, albeit at only a modest pace. I do not expect\ngrowth to pick up significantly, and therein do not expect marked improvement in the\nvery weak labor markets.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with what is known as our “dual\nmandate” – using monetary policy to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable\nemployment over a reasonable horizon. The unemployment rate is well above what I\nexpect it to be over the long run, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably high for\nwhat I consider far too long. And PCE inflation is likely to be below 2 percent this year\nand for some time to come.\nGiven the poor current conditions and my forecast for continued weakness – and\nthe evidence that suggests the problem is one of aggregate demand rather than structural\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 30, 2012 at 4:50 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment – I believe monetary policy needs to be more stimulative if we hope to\nmeet both elements of the dual mandate in a reasonable time frame. And should some of\nthe downside risks that I have emphasized materialize, such as a significant disruption\nfrom abroad, more aggressive actions would certainly be warranted.\nI thank you again for inviting me to discuss the economy, and policy, with you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on May 22 released a study on the “Economic Effects of\nReducing the Fiscal Restraint That Is Scheduled to Occur in 2013.” The CBO noted “Under those fiscal\nconditions, which will occur under current law, growth in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in calendar year\n2013 will be just 0.5 percent, CBO expects—with the economy projected to contract at an annual rate of\n1.3 percent in the first half of the year and expand at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second half.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s\n2012 Financial Markets Conference\n(“Financial Reform: The Devil's in the Details”)\nStone Mountain, Georgia\nApril 11, 2012\n\nI want to thank President Dennis Lockhart and the staff at the Atlanta Fed for\nputting together a very topical and engaging conference, and for inviting me to take part\non this panel. A session on money market mutual funds is particularly relevant, given the\nchanges enacted in 2010 and the additional proposals that the SEC has been developing.\nOf course, I want to note that the views I express today are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe focus of my remarks today will be financial stability. Both the financial\ncrisis in 2008 and the more recent sovereign debt problems in Europe underscored the\nsignificance of money market fund flows to short-term credit markets, and the potential\nfor disruptions in those flows and markets to create broader economic difficulties. I will\nleave it to other panelists to focus on the impact of recently implemented and proposed\nregulations on individual funds or suppliers of short-term funds. Instead I will look at\npotential reforms in the context of whether they promote financial stability.\nMoney market funds serve as important intermediaries between investors who\nwant low-risk, highly liquid investments, and banks and corporations that have short-term\nborrowing needs. Money market funds are a key buyer of the short-term debt\ninstruments issued by banks and corporations – commercial paper, bank certificates of\ndeposit, and repurchase agreements.\nGiven the importance of short-term credit markets to both investors and\nbusinesses, any disruptions to those credit markets represent a potential financial stability\nissue of both domestic and global significance. I would add that in discussions about\nways that financial problems could, potentially, be amplified into a financial crisis, I hear\nmoney market funds often brought up.\nMy comments today are going to focus on prime money market funds, as opposed\nto government funds or tax-free funds. Prime funds hold a mix of short-term debt\ninstruments including commercial paper and large certificates of deposit, as well as\nTreasury and agency securities.1 Prime funds played a critical role in the amplification of\nfinancial problems in recent years.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nTo summarize, my key points today will be the following:\n\n1. Some prime funds have taken on significant credit risk – at times incurring\nlosses that necessitated the support of the parent or sponsor2 of the fund, and\nin one case substantial government support.\n2. In my view the assumption of significant credit risk is not appropriate for\nintermediaries that have no capital and implicitly promise a fixed net asset\nvalue (NAV).3\n3. Without additional reforms, this structural problem could trigger or amplify\nfuture financial stability problems. Issues of potential financial instability\nwere not fully resolved by the 2010 reforms, although those reforms were\nimportant steps forward.\n4. Fragilities related to money market funds could be significantly mitigated by\nproposed SEC reforms and, potentially, by monitoring and reducing the credit\nrisk taken by prime funds.\n\nPrime Money Market Funds and Credit Risk\nThe amount of credit risk taken by some money market funds was highlighted\nduring the financial crisis by the loss associated with the $785 million of Lehman\nsecurities held by the Reserve Primary Fund. The loss led to the Reserve Primary Fund\n“breaking the buck,” and this violation of the “as good as bank deposits” implicit promise\nled in turn to a run on many other prime money market funds as investors became\nconcerned that other funds would not be able to maintain a fixed net asset value.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUltimately, the crisis prompted the U.S. Treasury to provide emergency insurance, and\nthe Federal Reserve to provide emergency liquidity.4\nIt is very important to note that credit losses at prime money market funds have\nnot been limited to those of the Reserve Primary Fund, or related only to the failure of\nLehman Brothers. Figure 1 provides examples of other securities that were held by\nmoney market funds when their issuers defaulted over the 2007 to 2008 time frame.\nAs Chairman Schapiro of the SEC has recently noted, the “SEC staff provided noaction assurances that allowed more than 100 money market funds to enter into capital\nsupport agreements with their [sponsors] in 2007-2008.”5 In addition to many sponsor\nguarantees, no less than 47 distinct funds received direct support via a cash contribution\nor an outright purchase of distressed securities at above-market prices – and some funds\nreceived direct support more than once. Based on our review of SEC no-action letters\nand publicly available financial statements, direct support during the time period from\n2007 to 20106 was at least $3.2 billion.\nFigure 2 provides data on sponsor support. There are a number of cases between\n2007 and 2010 where identified sponsor support exceeded one percent of assets under\nmanagement (nine in total – four cases between 1 and 2 percent of assets under\nmanagement, two cases between 2 and 3 percent, and three cases over 3 percent).7 In\nfact, in one instance the dollar amount of support exceeded the amount of the Reserve\nPrimary Fund’s Lehman exposure.\nThese data highlight that a number of money market funds were taking credit risk\nthat was significant given their mandate and structural limitations, but unlike the Reserve\nPrimary Fund they had a sponsor that was willing and able to provide support.8 In the\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nabsence of the support of sponsors, many of these money market funds would have been\nunable to maintain the fixed NAV.\nGoing forward, one cannot necessarily assume that sponsors will choose to\nprovide financial support; and also, to the extent that the sponsor is a regulated financial\ninstitution that requires regulatory approval to provide support, approval of such support\nis not guaranteed. I would suggest that the ability to assume excessive credit risk under\nthese conditions reflects a potential flaw in the design of money market funds that still\nneeds to be addressed.\nThe credit risk taken by some money market funds is still significant, even after\nthe financial problems experienced from 2007 to 2010 and the recent SEC reforms. As\nrecently as the fall of 2011, a sponsor provided support to a fund as a result of its holding\nof downgraded Eksportfinans paper.\nOne of the challenges in addressing the credit risk of money market funds is that\nTier 1 securities that are supposed to reflect relatively low credit risk to money market\nfunds in reality encompass a broad range of credit quality, including some securities with\nsignificant credit risk. This is shown in Figure 3, which examines the credit risk of\nprime funds – classifying their holdings by the credit default swap (CDS) spread of the\nissuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider of the holdings. A CDS provides insurance against\ndefault risk, and the CDS spread is a measure of how costly it would be to get insurance\nagainst possible default of a security.\nAs a benchmark, the current five-year CDS spread for U.S. government securities\nis approximately 30 basis points. As the figure shows, as of September 30 of last year 23\npercent of the prime holdings had an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nquote of between 200 and 300 basis points. Note that the issuers, sponsors, or liquidity\nproviders of 4.5 percent of the holdings had CDS quotes in excess of 400 basis points.9\nThis highlights that credit markets are assigning a significant chance that some money\nmarket fund investments that current regulation deem permissible could in fact default.\nAnd, obviously, that the credit risk embedded in many prime money market mutual funds\nis substantially greater than the credit risk in U.S. government-only funds.\nThe 2008 run on money market funds that began with problems at a single fund\n(the Reserve Primary Fund) highlights the importance of understanding the credit risk of\nindividual funds, not just the average credit risk of the industry. An individual fund that\ndoes not have a sponsor that is willing or able to provide support if the fund experiences a\ncredit loss can cause a significant run for the whole industry.\nFigure 4 contrasts the credit risk exposure of two money market funds at a point\nin time in the fall of last year. It provides an indication of the within-industry variation in\ncredit risk. Each of these funds held some high-risk securities – although Fund 1 more so\nthan Fund 2 – illustrating the problem of holdings that bear more than the “minimal credit\nrisk” required by the SEC’s rule 2a-7.10 At that point in time last year, Fund 1 had 23\npercent of its assets in securities that had a credit default swap spread over 400, which for\ncontext is more than 10 times the current rate for U.S. government securities.11\nSuch within-industry variation matters because the average exposure of money\nmarket funds could look just fine, but if a highly exposed fund suffered a substantial\ncredit loss it could potentially trigger a run like the one experienced in 2008.\nA significant source of the credit risk in many prime money market funds over the\npast year has been the large exposure to European banks. Figure 5 shows the exposure\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nof the industry to financial institutions in France, Italy, and Spain. While these exposures\nwere substantially reduced as the risks became more apparent, I have to question whether\ninvestors in money market funds would have been willing to directly hold such large\nexposures in foreign financial institutions, and whether such investments were consistent\nwith the perceptions of very low credit risk that many investors expect to be associated\nwith prime money market funds.12\nFigure 6 shows that while the exposure to Europe declined significantly through\nDecember 2011, 36 percent of prime money market fund assets13 remain in Europe\n(granted, generally in the stronger countries). So, when considering the so-called “tail”\nrisk from unexpected problems in Europe, money market funds remain an important\npotential transmission channel to the United States.\nA good example of this potential risk is the exposure that many money market\nfunds had to Dexia, a bank that required the support of the French and Belgian\ngovernments in the fall of 2011. Figure 7 shows that in the spring of 2011, over 60 funds\nhad exposure to Dexia.14 As the five-year credit default swap spread for Dexia rose, most\nmoney market funds substantially reduced their holdings. However, given the very high\nCDS spreads on Dexia, the extent to which money funds were willing to hold it at all is\nstriking.\nDespite the experience of the Reserve Primary Fund during 2008, a number of\nmoney market funds held securities that posed significant credit risk during the 2011\nperiod of European problems. While there were significant outflows,15 no losses or runs\noccurred – but in my view this should provide us little solace. We should care not only\nabout the realized losses, but also about the potential losses associated with risk\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nexposures. From a public policy perspective, we should in short care that significant\nrisks were taken even though the potential bad outcome did not occur.\nThe willingness of multiple money market funds to take excessive credit risk even\nafter the 2010 reforms suggests that money market funds, absent some changes, still pose\nsome risks to financial stability. Simply put, my view is that taking large credit risks is\nincompatible with being an intermediary that has no capital and implicitly promises a\nfixed net asset value.\n\nPotential Additional Actions\nWhile the 2010 reforms improved the liquidity and credit risk of money market\nfunds, I believe the data I have presented today suggest that more substantial initiatives\nare needed to reduce the risks to financial stability.\nOne possible way to mitigate the risks is to no longer transact at a fixed net asset\nvalue. This has several possible benefits, but also potential drawbacks.\nAs with other mutual funds, a floating NAV would highlight that the underlying\nasset values do fluctuate, and that the investor is taking some risk. By observing\nmovements in the NAV, investors would have regular reminders that investments in\nmoney market funds are not riskless, and that absent sponsor or government support the\nfund cannot guarantee that it will always be able to return an investor’s money dollar for\ndollar.\nFurthermore, a money market fund that takes credit risk simply cannot guarantee\nthat it will on its own pay a fixed net asset value. Should a large credit loss occur, the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfixed net asset value will not be able to be maintained unless the sponsor is willing and\nable to provide financial support.\nStill, there are two potential negatives to a floating rate NAV. First, it transforms\nthe product from a near-substitute for bank deposits into an asset with a fluctuating price.\nThose fluctuations in price, and the taxable gains or losses that result, would make money\nmarket funds less attractive as a transaction account for many investors – in part due to\nthe taxable gains or losses. Second, it only partially prevents runs, because as soon as\ninvestors become concerned about credit losses, there is a strong incentive to get out of\nthe fund early. The first investor to leave the fund (to redeem) avoids the large drops in\nvaluation and loss of liquidity that typically accompany a run.\nWhile the incentive to run is not eliminated by a floating NAV, it is certainly less\nthan for a fund with a fixed NAV that risks “breaking the buck.”16 Interestingly, floating\nNAV funds are used in Europe.\nIn sum, a move to a floating NAV would more accurately reflect the fundamental\nnature of the product actually offered, rather than making implicit promises to investors\nthat cannot always be kept during stressful times.\nAnother alternative would be to require money market funds to hold capital, and\nto impose a cost on redemptions. An appropriate redemption policy could substantially\nreduce the incentives to run. With appropriately calibrated capital and redemption\npolicies, the incentive to run (and thus the inability to fully pay investors) would be\ngreatly reduced.\nTo digress for a moment, it is important to distinguish between solvency issues\nand liquidity problems. Slowing down redemptions would assist in situations where\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthere is underlying value but a drying up of liquidity may lead to losses from “fire sale”\nprices.\nThese remedies also raise potential concerns and have costs. In general any\nreforms that, in the language of economists, would “internalize the costs” associated with\nsystemic risk would to some degree make money market funds less attractive for\ninvestors.\nRaising capital in a low interest rate environment would be challenging and,\ndepending on how it is raised, would impact returns to sponsors or investors. A change\nin redemption practices would pose a potential risk to investors that would make the\nmoney market fund less attractive relative to other products. But despite these concerns,\nappropriately calibrated capital and redemption policies would reduce the risk that\ninvestors would not be able to get full value on their redemptions or that runs would\noccur.\nBeyond the two alternatives I have discussed, there may be additional ways to\naddress these issues. There may be opportunities for SEC policymaking and monitoring\nto inhibit funds from taking on excessive credit risk. As I have shown today, the extent\nof credit risk taken by some money market funds is shown by the number of times\nsponsors have needed to provide support and by the makeup of underlying assets in\ncertain funds. The SEC limitations placed on credit risk are currently too broad to avoid\nsignificant credit risk exposure and there may be ways to use market information17 to\ndetermine if assets in the funds are inconsistent with the intent to limit significant credit\nrisk exposures at money market funds.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I believe the approaches I have mentioned today\ncould significantly mitigate financial stability concerns around money market funds. Of\ncourse, none of the proposals eliminate the risk entirely, and none are costless. Neither\nare they mutually exclusive – elements could be adopted in some combination.\nEveryone knows the SEC is working very hard on this, and could have a proposal\nfor reforms out in the coming months. I strongly commend their efforts to arrive at\nreforms that reduce the risks surrounding money market funds.\nThe bottom line, in my view, is that the status quo is not acceptable. As I have\nshown today, a number of money market funds took significant credit risk that ultimately\nled to them needing sponsor support in the period from 2007 to 2010. Substantial\ngovernment support was required after the Reserve Primary Fund experienced losses.\nMoreover, a significant number of money market funds continued to take substantial\ncredit risk during the recent European financial problems. So, I must conclude that\nreforms enacted to date do not seem to sufficiently limit money market funds’ ability to\nassume excessive credit risks.\nA money market fund with a fixed net asset value set by an intermediary with no\ncapital that takes on credit risk will, eventually, result in the failure to meet obligations in\nthe absence of outside support by either a sponsor or government. Funds need to be\nstructured so that neither sponsor support nor government support is likely or necessary,\neven during times of stress.\nI realize the industry is opposed to measures that would decrease the\nattractiveness of funds but in the end a stronger industry could result, beyond the\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfinancial stability improvements that are my main focus. But all in all I believe the risks\nto the stability of the financial system that underpins the economy are too great not to\ntake the actions that will make the industry, and our financial system, more stable.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit made up 24 percent and 25 percent of prime\nmoney market fund portfolios, respectively, at the end of February. Repurchase agreements were\n19 percent. And finally, Treasury and Agency securities were 9 percent and 10 percent,\nrespectively.\n2\n\nSponsors are the asset management firms and their parents and affiliates.\n\n3\n\nOf course, a fund prospectus typically makes clear that the NAV can drop below the fixed\nvalue.\n\n4\n\nFor more information on this aspect of the financial crisis, see a forthcoming article in The\nJournal of Finance entitled “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity\nFacilities?

Using the highest AUM over the period provides a conservatively biased estimate of\nsupport.\n\n8\n\nInterestingly, evidence from the financial crisis would suggest that investors are aware of this\noption on the part of sponsors. My colleague at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors,\nPatrick McCabe, finds in his paper The Cross Section of Money Market Fund Risks and Financial\nCrises that \"outflows were larger for MMFs that had paid higher gross yields in the previous year\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 10:30 A.M.

The remaining 63 percent of the value of prime holdings included holdings\nwith an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS spread of less than 200 basis points and\nthose for which no CDS quotes were available.\n\n10\n\nMoney market funds are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and\nthe rules adopted under that Act, particularly Rule 2a-7 under the Act. See\nhttp://www.sec.gov/answers/mfmmkt.htm\n\n11\n\nLikewise in Figure 4, holdings with an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS spread\nof 200 basis points or more accounted for 48 percent and 45 percent of the value of Fund 1 and\nFund 2 holdings, respectively. The remaining 52 percent and 55 percent of the value of Fund 1\nand Fund 2 holdings included holdings with an issuer, sponsor, or liquidity provider with a CDS\nspread of less than 200 basis points and those for which no CDS quotes were available.\n\n12\n\nAlso, you can see that the January 2012 figure shows a reversal of the downward trend.\n\n13\n\nUp from 34 percent in December.\n\n14\n\nThe Dexia holdings and CDS spreads are those of Dexia Credit Local, the Dexia Group’s\nFrench subsidiary. At the close of 2010, Dexia Credit Local held assets of 361 billion euros\n($484 billion) representing 64 percent of the assets of the Dexia Group.\n\n15\n\nFor example June 2011 had the largest outflows from prime funds of any month since the 2008\ncrisis.\n\n16\n\nWith a floating NAV, investors are not able to redeem shares at $1 when they are clearly worth\nless, so the floating NAV would mitigate somewhat the ability of redeeming investors to leave\nlosses behind.\n\n17\n\nSuch as, potentially, market pricing information on credit default swaps for certain securities.\n\n13\n\n\fMoney Market Mutual Funds\nand Financial Stability\nEric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the National Institute\nof Economic and Social Research\nLondon, England\nMarch 27, 2012\n\nGood evening. I would like to thank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research\nfor hosting this event. Given the economic and financial shocks that have buffeted the global\neconomy in recent years, I think it is particularly important to share perspectives across the Atlantic –\non the economic outlook, but also on the risks to both the outlook and financial stability.\nI am honored to be sharing the stage with Adam Posen. I have long admired Adam’s\nacademic work and policy perspectives, and I am looking forward to discussions with Adam and his\ncolleagues at the Bank of England over the next several days.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nOf course, I would like to note that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nToday I would like to begin with a discussion of emerging economic trends in the United\nStates, and then move into a discussion about opportunities to bolster stability in our financial\ninfrastructure. My theme throughout is the need to avoid complacency.\nRecently released statistics are consistent with improved financial market conditions and\ncontinued – albeit painfully slow – progress in labor markets. At the same time, the spending data\nhave been very weak. How should we reconcile these differences?\nFocusing only on financial and labor market conditions, one might conclude that the recovery\nis undeniably gaining traction – and that spending will improve as higher personal income and wealth\ncontribute to a reinforcing cycle that propels us toward full employment in the U.S. Alternatively,\nfocusing only on the weak spending data might lead one to conclude that the improvements in labor\nmarkets and financial conditions are going to prove temporary, because the recent improvements are\nprobably unsustainable if the U.S. economy continues to grow at only a 2 percent rate.\nIt may take several quarters before we know which of these two perspectives is actually better\nreflective of the U.S. economy today.\nBeyond discussing the economic outlook in the United States, I would like to make a few\nobservations on financial markets. I’ll state my firm view that the actions taken by central banks\naround the world – for example, engaging in foreign exchange swap line agreements and using less\ntraditional monetary policy tools – have been both appropriate and necessary.\nHowever, many of these actions were ultimately necessary because supervisory and regulatory\nframeworks were not sufficiently macro-prudential. By macro-prudential I am referring to a focus on\nrisks, vulnerabilities, or dependencies that potentially could affect the financial system as a whole –\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nversus just the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Ideally, central banks should not need\nto take actions to support continued financial intermediation, because financial institutions should be\nsufficiently resilient to ensure that even unusual financial-market stress would not impair effective\nintermediation. Recent events have highlighted that we remain far from achieving that goal.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\nWith that preview, let me begin with some thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook.\nThere have been positive trends in some recent economic data. U.S. financial market\nconditions are clearly improving. Some of the recent improvements reflect the moderation or removal\nof some significant, imminent, downside “tail” risks. At least for now, Europe seems to have avoided\nthe risk of a so-called “Lehman moment” – a risk that had seriously concerned investors.\nThe S&P 500 has risen roughly 9 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure\n1. Risk gauges, such as spreads on bonds and credit default swaps (CDSs), have improved. Bond\nissuance has been strong. U.S. financial markets have gathered steam and reflect increased optimism\nabout likely economic outcomes.\nHowever, my enthusiasm is tempered by the challenges still facing Europe.\nForward-looking financial markets seem to be pricing in improved economic outcomes, and\nthere are some brightening signs, to be sure. Figure 1 shows that auto sales in the United States have\nrebounded nicely, and consumer sentiment has improved significantly since last August. In addition,\npayroll employment in the U.S. has been growing at a rate of 245,000 jobs a month over the past three\nmonths. This should mean more disposable income, which coupled with increasing household wealth\n(fueled by stock market gains), should be consistent with an improved outlook for spending.\nHowever, when we focus solely on the incoming spending data, the outlook appears less\nrobust. Since the start of the recovery, what we call real final sales – that is, domestically produced\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ngoods and services (net of inventories, which can swing significantly from quarter to quarter) – have\nbeen growing at only 1.7 percent, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, my forecast for the first quarter\nof this year would be for real final sales to grow at roughly 2 percent, only slightly better than the\naverage during the U.S. recovery to date.\nFigure 3 highlights two distinctive features of this recovery – unusually weak residential\ninvestment, despite very low interest rates; and an extended decline in state and local government\nspending.\nThe health of the U.S. housing market has been hampered by significant declines in housing\nprices, very elevated foreclosures, and a large inventory of vacant homes. As a result, residential\ninvestment – which normally grows quite rapidly during a recovery – has not provided its customary\noverall boost to the economic recovery. While some tentative signs of an improving housing sector\nhave emerged, for the reasons I just mentioned it is likely to be subdued relative to historical\nexperience.\nAlso, state and local government spending has been unusually weak during this recovery. The\nseverity of the recession, combined with the fall in home values that are the basis for many local\ngovernment tax revenues, have forced substantial cuts in state and local spending. It is worth noting\nthat in the U.S., state and local government spending accounts for a larger share of GDP than does\nfederal government spending: 11.7 percent of GDP, compared to 8.0 percent for federal spending.\nState and local budgets will remain under stress as governments face increasing demands on\ntheir resources, such as addressing significant shortfalls in certain areas (for example employee\npensions). At the same time, federal government spending is expected to be cut significantly, making\ngovernment spending as a component of GDP a challenging aspect of the economic outlook in the\nUnited States.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nSo, despite some good production data and the optimism seen in financial markets, the\nspending data are consistent with real U.S. GDP growth over the course of 2012 of only 2.5 percent –\nwhich unfortunately is only fast enough to make modest headway at reducing the unemployment in\nour labor market.\nGiven the very modest recovery to date, it is surprising that the unemployment rate, depicted\nin the recent downward trend in the line in Figure 4, has shown as much improvement as it has. The\ncurrent unemployment rate of 8.3 percent represents a decline from 9.1 percent over the past six\nmonths, despite only modest growth in spending.\nHowever, while the unemployment rate has declined, there has not been much improvement in\nthe important ratio of employment to population, shown in Figure 5.\nOf course aggregate employment-to-population ratios are impacted by demographic changes –\nfor example the aging of the “baby boom” generation in the U.S. To explore the role that recent\ndemographic changes might have played on the movement of the employment-to-population series,\nFigure 6 shows the same concept for particular age cohorts that are less likely to be impacted by\ndemographics over the short term. The employment-to-population ratio in age groups where the\nattachment to working should not have changed shows a pattern very similar to that of the ratio as a\nwhole.\nSo part of the decline in the unemployment rate is resulting from workers leaving the labor\nforce. Furthermore, only in recent months has the employment-to-population ratio improved and the\npayroll employment growth clearly exceeded the normal growth rate of the labor force. So the U.S.\nremains well below the employment levels that would be viewed as consistent with the maximum\nsustainable employment aspect of the Federal Reserve’s so-called dual mandate.\nThe other element of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is inflation. Figure 7 charts two\nprimary measures of inflation – total personal consumption expenditure inflation, and core personal\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nconsumption expenditure inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy categories). Core\nPCE inflation – again excluding food and energy – has remained below the Federal Reserve target of\n2 percent throughout the recovery. Total PCE inflation, including food and energy, is slightly above 2\npercent, but has diverged from core prices when commodity prices such as oil have spiked up or\ndeclined substantially. As the figure shows, however, the more volatile total measure tends over time\nto revert to the level of core inflation.\nWith the recent spike in oil prices, it is likely that total PCE inflation will rise further, but this\nincrease is likely to be temporary, reflecting volatile oil price movements. For 2013 my own forecast\nis for both total PCE and core PCE inflation to be below 2 percent, although this forecast assumes that\nMiddle East tensions do not result in another sharp spike in oil prices.\nAnother potential inflationary concern has been raised by the swelling of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet that occurred as we purchased assets to advance monetary policy goals. But\nFigure 8 shows that commercial real estate lending is still declining – and while commercial and\nindustrial lending has increased, it has yet to return to its level at the beginning of the recession. What\nthis means it that by and large, the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet has not turned into a\nsignificant increase in the supply of money, because banks have not been lending out their holdings of\nexcess reserves. So the expansion of reserves that occurred in 2008 as the Fed expanded its balance\nsheet has not been inflationary, given the subdued bank lending environment.\nIndeed, bank lending has been quite modest despite a relatively rapid improvement in bank\ncapital ratios in the United States. This should give some European analysts pause, as the experience\nin the U.S. (as well as the earlier Japanese experience) suggests that the constraints on bank lending\ndue to the recent financial problems in Europe may be more long-lasting than some are expecting.\nIn summary, while recent financial-market and labor-market data in the U.S. have been\nencouraging, spending data remain disappointing. Like many forecasters, I expect higher real GDP\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ngrowth as the year progresses. But I would caution that I and many others held a similar view at the\nbeginning of 2010 and 2011.\nIf real GDP does not grow more rapidly and unemployment remains at its current\nunacceptably high level, monetary policy may need to be more accommodative. The U.S.\nunemployment rate remains well above a level that could be considered full employment, while we\nare likely to undershoot our inflation targets. Together these factors provide room for flexibility in\nthe response of monetary policy as we receive additional information on current economic conditions.\n\nChallenges in Bank Funding\nDespite the improvements we are seeing in the U.S. economy, a number of significant risks\nand challenges remain. One involves geo-political risks, which have already caused oil prices to rise\nmore than most non-energy commodity prices. Any further significant increase in energy prices\nwould be an additional impediment to faster growth. Another involves the unsustainable budget\ndeficits that many countries, including the United States, currently have. The challenge, I believe, is\nthat greater fiscal responsibility must be implemented in a way that does not threaten tentative\neconomic recoveries. A third risk is the continued fragility in our financial infrastructure – a situation\nthat can substantially amplify other economic problems. It is this third risk that I would like to touch\nupon today.\nThe economic slowdown that began in the United States several years ago went from being a\nmild event led by housing-related problems to being a much more severe and long-lasting economic\ndownturn. This was, in part, because of the architecture of the financial sector.1 Today I would like\nto highlight one particular potential structural flaw in the financial architecture – the dependence on\nshort-term funding.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThis past financial crisis was a primer on vulnerabilities to short-term funding. Specifically,\nwholesale funding utilized by large global banks dried up during the financial crisis. As large banks\nsought to reduce their exposure to counterparties of concern, the term of loans made in the\nmarketplace decreased, and the cost of short-term credit spiked.\nAnd many of the problems were occurring outside of traditional depository institutions. Bear\nStearns and Lehman Brothers were investment banks, not commercial banks. As counterparties\ndramatically reduced both unsecured and secured lending to these two entities, funding was no longer\navailable and the firms failed.\nSimilarly, money market mutual funds with exposures to investment banks in many cases\nrequired support from parent or sponsoring entities. And one fund without parental support – the\nReserve Primary Fund – sustained a credit loss that would ultimately lead to its liquidation. This led\nto a run on prime funds, which in turn further impaired short-term credit markets.\nAs Figure 9 shows, the money market mutual fund industry held $3.5 trillion in assets under\nmanagement in mid September 2008. Prime funds, which hold a mix of Treasury and agency\nsecurities and other short-term debt instruments (including commercial paper and large certificates of\ndeposit), held nearly 60 percent of industry assets, or $2.1 trillion.\nWhen the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck,” outflows from prime funds totaled roughly\n$500 billion over a four-week period. Although much of the outflow went into government money\nmarket mutual funds (which hold only Treasury and agency securities, and repurchase agreements\nbacked by such securities), these inflows did little to ease the strains being felt in the corporate\nfunding markets resulting from the exit from prime funds.2\nU.S. money market funds are thought of and marketed as highly liquid, low-risk investments\nwith many of the same characteristics as traditional bank deposits. As a result, money market fund\ninvestors and money market fund managers should be highly sensitive to changes in underlying risks.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThe crisis in autumn of 2008 taught us that safeguarding against runs on financial entities like money\nmarket funds – entities that do not have a large, stable, core deposit base and do not have ordinary\naccess to the central bank’s “lender of last resort” function – was and is important, unfinished work if\nwe are to have a more stable financial system.\nA number of significant reforms are being contemplated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) to reduce the risks surrounding money market funds. But even with significant\nreforms such as these – reforms, by the way, that I am highly supportive of and will say more about at\na conference in Atlanta in two weeks – money market funds will continue to be a potentially unstable\nsource of U.S. dollar funding. From a financial stability perspective, we need to recognize the\npossibility of a deterioration in the ability or willingness of the money market funds to keep providing\na dependable source of funds to counterparties (for example, the issuers of commercial paper that the\nfunds purchase). This could occur as a result of a change in the risk profile of those counterparties.\nWholesale funding issues also played an important role in recent European banking problems.\nSome European banks were too dependent on wholesale funding, particularly funding coming from\nU.S. money market funds.\nFigure 10 shows the European exposure of U.S. prime money market funds over the past year.\nGiven the changes in the risk profile of some banks, as a result of increases in sovereign debt risk,\nmoney market funds have sought to reduce what was their large risk exposure to European financial\ninstitutions. Most money market funds in the beginning of 2011 had already dramatically reduced\nexposure to peripheral financial institutions. Over the second half of last year there was a very\nsignificant decline in exposure to euro-zone financial institutions. (In addition, remaining exposure\nwas shortened in tenor, meaning time to maturity). Figure 10 highlights the declines across Europe\nand Figure 11 shows the decline over the course of 2011 more specifically by certain countries.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nBecause U.S. money market funds had been a significant source of short-term funds for\nEuropean institutions, money funds’ move away from short-term European debt resulted in a\nsignificant shortage of dollar funds available to these institutions. I will show you some market\nindicators of these shortages in a moment.\nNo money market fund encountered a problem meeting investor redemptions during the\nEuropean sovereign debt crisis3. But even without such a problem, money market funds still had an\nimpact on the availability of credit to financial institutions for which the perception of risk had\nchanged.\nProblems with financial stability do not require a failure to create a significant disruption in\nthe flow of credit. In light of the incentives facing money market funds, financial institutions that rely\nheavily on them for funding put themselves in a position where a short-term change in perceived risk\ncan create significant funding problems. And as we have seen repeatedly over the past several years,\nfunding problems at one institution can quickly spread to the financial system as a whole.\nFigure 12 highlights that funding challenges for European banks were developing as money\nmarket funds reduced their European exposures. The rise in the LIBOR to OIS spread4 indicates that\nfinancial institutions became more concerned about lending to each other as money market funding\ndeclined. Similarly, the sharp rise in the rates on the 3-month euro-dollar foreign exchange swap\nindicates the pressure exerted by reduced dollar funding from the money market funds on European\nfinancial institutions’ funding.\nIn short, the rational reaction of money market funds to perceived changes in risk – reducing\nEuropean exposure – led to various funding pressures. The issues eventually were addressed by\ncentral bank actions that significantly expanded liquidity, both through foreign exchange swaps and\nthrough European Central Bank (ECB) term lending to European institutions. While these actions\nhave been very important for stabilizing financial markets, I believe we need to get to the point of\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nhaving a more resilient financial infrastructure that does not require central bank interventions during\ntimes of stress.\nFor financial institutions and supervisors this implies thinking more carefully about stress\nscenarios, and specifically about whether critical funding will evaporate when it is needed most.\nWhile Basel Capital Accord proposals will help in this respect, I would strongly suggest that stresstesting scenarios assess how well risk-sensitive sources of short-term funding will hold up in an\nenvironment of heightened risk. This liquidity-focused assessment would be an important\ncomplement to current stress testing, and a prudent aspect of risk management.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would re-emphasize that financial-market and economic\nconditions have been improving since the start of the year. Central banks have played an important\nrole in encouraging more economic growth. In the United States, accommodative monetary policy\nhas been essential to improving financial conditions, but growth remains disappointingly slow to date,\nand significant downside risks remain. Should growth slow down more than is expected, more policy\naccommodation could be advisable.\nEven if growth should improve more than expected in the U.S., the country will likely remain\nfar from what anyone would consider full employment – so in my view policy accommodation should\nonly be removed once it is clear that the Fed’s dual mandate can be achieved within a reasonable\nperiod of time.\nAs with monetary policy, work remains to be done to improve financial stability. Today I\nhave highlighted one area that deserves more attention – ensuring that we reduce the risk of\ndisruptions to credit flows that result from wholesale short-term funding problems, and that require\ncentral bank intervention.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, March 27, 2012 at 12:35 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 5:35 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nFor more information see prior speeches including “Global Financial Intermediaries: Lessons and Continuing\nChallenges”, “Towards Greater Financial Stability in Short-Term Credit Markets”, and “Defining Financial Stability, and\nSome Policy Implications of Applying the Definition” [available at:\n•\n•\n•\n\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/101911/index.htm,\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/092911/index.htm, and\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm, respectively].\n\n2\n\nFor more information on this aspect of the financial crisis, see a forthcoming article in The Journal of Finance entitled\n“How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities?

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSmall Business Funding\nand the Economic Recovery\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConnecticut Business & Industry Association\nand MetroHartford Alliance\n“Economic Summit & Outlook 2012”\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 6, 2012\n\nI appreciate the invitation to speak today at the Connecticut Business and Industry\nAssociation. It strikes me that the timing of this gathering is particularly appropriate, in\nthat discussions of the economy – at least over the last few years – have not fueled any\nholiday cheer, but have been relevant to hopeful New Year’s resolutions.\nWhen I joined you at this event two years ago, I reviewed some of the patterns we\nsee in labor markets, and in particular industries, during early stages of recoveries. I\nnoted the forces making it likely that gains in employment would be slow in this\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrecovery. I wish I could say I was too pessimistic that day, but as we all know the\nrecovery has been painfully slow.\nToday, after a brief overview of some recent economic trends I would like to\nfocus on some key financial data. In particular, I want to highlight a distinctive feature of\nthe recent recession and the anemic recovery – the fact that financial-market problems\nhad a disproportionate effect on the length and severity of the recession and have been a\ncomplicating factor in the lack of strength in the recovery.\nI would like to walk you through a number of charts that lay out the situation –\nparticularly as it relates to small business financing. My “punch line” is that as\nchallenging as the financial headwinds to recovery have been, there are still policy\noptions to consider and explore that could make a difference, and I will mention a few\npossibilities.\nOf course I would add that the views I express today are my own, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nFirst, I’ll touch on the economic trends. I would say the economic data have been\nimproving somewhat, relative to what we were seeing in the summer. Various supply\nshocks that buffeted the world economy in the first half of 2011 are receding, as are the\nincreases in a variety of commodity prices. In part, these reversals reflect expected\neconomic weakness in other parts of the world.\nAs Figure 1 shows, a number of prices that were increasing in the first half of\n2011 (in blue) have moderated more recently (in red) – particularly energy prices and\nothers closely tied to energy, like airline fares, and also food and beverage prices. In\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\naddition to these data, I see no evidence of significant acceleration in labor costs – as a\nresult of weakness in labor markets – and also see reversals in a number of important\ncommodity price increases. As a result, I personally expect that inflation is likely to be\nbelow 2 percent not only in 2012 but also over the next several years.\nWhile the difficult conditions in labor markets are a reason inflation has been well\ncontained, the very weak job growth the country has experienced is of course itself a\ncritical problem. Figure 2 highlights the fact that many people are working part-time but\nwould prefer to work full time. The percent rose quickly during the recession (the shaded\nportion of the chart) and has stayed high. While these workers are currently employed,\nthis chart suggests that demand in the economy is not sufficiently strong for firms to\nemploy more workers full time. Labor demand simply remains too weak.\nWith inflation expected to remain below 2 percent, and unemployment and\nunderemployment so high, I believe it is important for the Federal Reserve to continue\nconsidering ways to promote stronger growth and hasten what is a painfully long, slow\nrecovery and adjustment time in the economy.\nAs a case in point, Figure 3 shows that households are now spending a lower\npercentage of their disposable income on debt-service payments, compared to just before\nthe onset of the recession when the ratio peaked at about 14 percent. While some of this\ndecline reflects unfortunate trends, such as defaults on mortgages, it also reflects the very\nlow interest-rate environment – which gives households an opportunity to improve their\nrelative financial condition1 (the net of their assets and liabilities) as less money is spent\non interest payments for mortgages and credit cards.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs an aside, I have emphasized in other talks that I think more can be done to\nfacilitate this process of adjustment – including tweaks to Government Sponsored\nEnterprise (GSE) mortgage programs and, potentially, expanding the purchase of\nmortgages by the Federal Reserve to keep mortgage rates low during a time of great\ndifficulty in housing markets.\nIn sum, I would say that the monetary policy actions already taken by the Federal\nReserve are allowing firms and households to speed up the adjustment process, and as\nsuch are laying the foundation for a stronger economy.\n\nEmployment Patterns\nNow I’d like to share some additional perspectives, informed by data. Figure 4\nshows the path of employment from its peak prior to the last four recessions. You see\nthat in the most recent recession and recovery, the decline from peak employment was\nmore severe and more lasting than in the previous three. Although we have experienced\nsome modest improvement in employment recently, we are nowhere near a return to the\npeak level of employment, which had occurred in the prior three recoveries by this point\nin time. The current recovery’s slow employment growth is, it goes without saying,\nworth examining in more detail.\nFigure 5 shows the net change in private sector employment, in thousands of\njobs, taking into account the size of the firm where the job gains or losses occurred. A\nclose look makes apparent that there are some significant differences over time. In the\n2001 recession the biggest employment declines were at the largest firms (shown in the\ngreen sections of each bar). During the recovery from the 2001 recession, firms with less\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthan 50 employees bounced back relatively quickly (the blue sections of each bar). But\nthe 2001 experience contrasts sharply with the recent recession, when the net decline was\nmuch more severe across all three firm-size categories.\nParticularly striking, however, is how much of a decline occurred for the smallest\nfirms employing less than 50 employees. Not only was the recession particularly severe\nfor small-firm employment, but employment growth during the recovery been slow at\nsmall firms.\nIn short, the experience of small firms is an important factor in the decline in\noverall employment during the most recent recession – and in the tepid employment\ngrowth in the recovery.\nFigure 6 highlights that in any dynamic recovery an economy experiences large\nflows of job gains and losses – but in this recovery the smallest and largest firms (on the\nextreme left and right of the chart) account for the most significant net job decline. The\nonly significant net gain (those slivers of green above the zero bound) is found in the\nmid-sized firm categories – those with more than 50 but less than 1,000 employees.\nThis pattern is quite different from the recovery that occurred after the 2001\nrecession, as shown in Figure 7 (the red bars). During that recovery, small firms (on the\nleft side of the chart) were an important source of net job gains, while larger firms (in the\ncenter and to the right) continued to be major sources of net job losses – consistent with\nthe overall slow improvement in employment during that recovery. In contrast, during\nthis recovery (the blue bars) the smallest firms have produced net job losses. The largest\nfirms have also accounted for job losses, but to a lesser degree compared to the prior\nrecovery.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne of the distinctive features of this recession has been the substantial decline in\nhousehold net worth, particularly resulting from the decline in real estate values. During\nrecessions that include sizable job losses, some people use difficult labor markets as their\nimpetus to start a small business. Such efforts have often been financed through home\nequity loans, which tend to be the lowest-cost type of financing available, especially\ncompared to the much more expensive use of credit cards.\nHowever, the ability to start a small business in this way has been severely\nhampered by the decline in house values and the tightening of credit standards. These\nfactors have made the traditional sources of entrepreneurial financing much less readily\navailable.\nIn addition, some of the states that saw the most dramatic declines in real estate\nvalues have also seen particularly high unemployment rates. As Figure 8 shows, the socalled “sand states” such as California, Nevada, and Florida have unemployment rates\nmuch higher than the U.S. average, and have also experienced sharp declines in\nresidential real estate values – declines much larger than the U.S. average. As a result,\nunemployed workers in these states are unlikely to have home equity available for\nfinancing a startup small business that could provide alternate employment.\nIn sum, these data suggest a very concerning dynamic. My sense is that in areas\nwhere high levels of unemployment might otherwise lead individuals to use home-equity\nfinancing or credit cards to start a business, today many find access to such forms of\ncredit impeded by impaired credit scores and the disappearance of home equity, given\ndepressed home values.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nPatterns in Bank Financing\nFigure 9 shows how the composition of business loans (at commercial and\nsavings banks) has changed over the past decade. There has been a significant increase in\nlarge commercial real estate loans, while small commercial and industrial (C&I) loans\nand small commercial real estate loans are now accounting for a lower share of the total.\nRelative to ten years ago, small-business loans account for a smaller percentage of overall\nbusiness loans.\nOver the past year we have seen only moderate growth in gross domestic product\n(GDP), and some hiring from the larger mid-sized firms. Figure 10 shows that lending\ndata are consistent with this pattern. Large C&I loans have recently been increasing, and\nlarge commercial real estate loans have remained relatively flat, but small C&I and small\ncommercial real estate loans have declined.\nTo me, the pattern is even more striking when you break up the composition of\nloans by the size of the bank, as shown in Figure 11. While small-business lending (in\nblue) has decreased across all bank sizes, the decline has been particularly striking at the\nlarger banks, shown on the left, where you see a substantial decline in small business\nloans. Banks of all sizes have increased their lending for large business loans (in red),\nwith the biggest percentage increase occurring at the smallest banks. In part this reflects\nthe fact that many of the smaller banks remain very well capitalized, and some mid-sized\nfirms have decided to shift their banking relationships from large banks to more\ncommunity-based banks (as more community-based banks compete for that business).\nFigure 12 shows the creation of new establishments. Given what I have\ndescribed so far, it is unfortunate but not surprising that the “birth rate” of new\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nestablishments declined sharply and remains below historical levels. Starting businesses\nwith financing from home equity or credit cards has become more difficult, and getting\nsmall business loans without some form of collateral remains quite challenging. While\ndemand for small business credit from qualified seekers surely plays a role, my sense is\nthat at least one reason for slow job creation in this tepid recovery may be that obtaining\nfinancing for new firms has become more difficult. And this suggests one reason why\nrecoveries after financial crises are particularly slow.\n\nImpact on the Outlook and Policymaking\nRecently the economic data has been somewhat more positive concerning the\nfourth quarter, but most forecasters do not, unfortunately, expect that momentum to carry\nthrough 2012. Most forecasters expect that economic growth in 2012 will be between 2\nto 3 percent, with the outlook gradually improving over the course of the year.\nUnfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar, which is consistent with only a very\ngradual improvement in labor markets.\nAllow me to briefly summarize my thinking.\nRecessions accompanied by significant financial problems tend to be more severe\ndownturns, followed by relatively slow recoveries. One reason for a slow recovery is that\nthe financial condition of households and firms – their “balance sheets,” given their\nliabilities and assets – take time to recover, and credit for borrowers with financial\nimpairments becomes more difficult to obtain. This is currently reflected in both\nlingering problems with residential real estate and with the difficulties related to small\nbusiness creation that I’ve described today.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nLet me touch briefly on residential real estate. It continues to be impacted by high\nforeclosures, falling housing prices in some areas, and tightened credit standards. I have\nnoted in prior talks that residential real estate tends to grow rapidly in the early stages of\na recovery, but not this time. Policymakers have pursued a variety of fiscal and monetary\napproaches to help with a housing recovery, and there have been recent suggestions\naround what more can be done.2\nIn terms of monetary policy, actions the Fed has taken to reduce long-term\ninterest rates are supportive of housing, and the Fed’s purchases of mortgage-backed\nsecurities provided an even more targeted approach to stimulating housing. Further\npurchases of mortgage-backed securities would in my view help provide a more rapid\nrecovery in housing, by reducing the costs of refinancing or purchasing new homes. Of\ncourse, these Fed actions would be even more effective if accompanied by fiscal policies\ndesigned to speed the recovery in housing.\nAs I have highlighted today, some of the slow employment growth we see is\nassociated with a less robust small business sector. The charts I shared show that loan\noriginations to small businesses have been quite weak, and that smaller firms have not\npushed the improvement in employment that we saw after the last recession. (I would\nnote that these points are amplified and more formally addressed in a Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston working paper by Duygan-Bump, Levkov, and Montoriol-Garriga.3).\nThis is a very serious challenge to the recovery and to the economy. As such,\npolicymakers must in my opinion explore all possible remedies, and weigh the costs and\nbenefits of each.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile many of the problems in this sector reflect impaired financials for many\nsmall businesses, and inadequate demand for products, I would add that credit availability\nfor creating or expanding small businesses can be quite a challenge. Again, monetary\npolicies that push down longer-term rates can be helpful, and that would be particularly\ntrue if there could be a targeted approach to improve small business financing. As with\nhousing, such monetary policies would be most effective if pursued in conjunction with\nfiscal policies targeted to improving conditions for small business.\nActions taken to date highlight that these problems are not easy to resolve. This,\nto my thinking, only underlines the need to look for creative policy solutions targeted to\nboth housing and small business.\nIn addition to these tangible problems, there remain of course significant\ndownside risks that are likely to make households and businesses cautious. Problems\nwith a slowing European economy, and sovereign and banking issues in Europe, remain\ndownside risks. Excessive fiscal austerity here or abroad also has the potential for near\nterm downside risk. Finally, recent uncertainty in the Middle East highlights the everpresent risk of potential oil shocks. Of course monetary policy has no direct influence on\nany of these risks. But they highlight the importance of finding ways to hasten the pace\nof economic growth and job creation at this point in time.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I know I don’t need to tell you that we continue to\nhave a slow recovery. We all know, as well, that issues of some concern exist in Europe\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nand elsewhere. I would reiterate that one reason for the tepid pace of recovery is that\nfinancial problems and restraints continue to have lingering effects on the economy.\nToday I have focused on one of those lingering problems, the impairment of\nhousehold financial condition that has made new business formation particularly difficult.\nGiven the low inflation rate and weak labor markets that are both likely to persist this\nyear, I believe the Federal Reserve should continue to explore ways to promote more\nrapid recovery through stronger growth.\nThe Federal Reserve has a variety of tools to consider as we try to promote faster\neconomic growth – including communicating in different ways the likely future path of\nthe economy and the implications for interest-rate policy (as was mentioned in FOMC\nminutes released this week), and considering additional large-scale asset purchases.\nIn addition, I believe that policymakers can and should continue to look at ways\nto better target fiscal and monetary policy to address the housing and small business\nfinancing problems we are seeing in this recovery. I believe that the continuing\ndifficulties compel us to think creatively and proactively about ways to return the\neconomy to full employment. I hope today I have stimulated some thinking about the\npossible policy remedies.\nThank you for having me join you today, and despite these challenging economic\ntimes let me extend my best wishes for the coming year to each of you and to every New\nEnglander.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\ni.e., the household “balance sheet.”\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 6, 2012 at 10:30 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Four Common Misconceptions\nAbout the Federal Reserve”\nRemarks at the\nBoston Economic Club\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 16, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nI would like to thank Chip Case for inviting me to address the Boston Economic Club.\nOver the years Chip has been a visiting scholar at the Boston Fed and has provided wonderful\ninsights into developments in real estate markets. As you all know, Chip is one of the country’s\nleading experts on real estate – an area that has been the focus of much attention and a lot of\ndifficulties over the last few years.\nNormally when giving a talk I try to focus on an important element of the economic\noutlook, or an important policy action the Federal Reserve has recently taken – and I use data to\nexplain the issue and its relevance.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nToday, however, I am going to take a different tack. I still want to use data – never fear –\nbut for a somewhat different reason.\nAs you know, ever since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has been lauded by\nsome for its bold actions and criticized by others. This comes with the territory of being the\nnation’s central bank. Certainly much of the criticism stems from an economy that is very\ndifficult for many citizens. And importantly, some of the criticism is deserved – and we at the\nFed truly try to learn when we do fall short.\nBut some of the criticism stems from what I’ll call some “common misconceptions” or\nassumptions about the Fed.1 Today I would like to offer a plainspoken defense to some of those\ncommon misconceptions. A defense rooted in facts and numbers, to be sure – my rhetorical\nskills may not win over Fed critics, but the facts and numbers may help them and others\nunderstand how the Fed actually operates.\nLet me acknowledge, of course, that as important and illuminating as they are, facts and\ndata do not capture the emotion and the frustration of these challenging economic times. At the\nFed we appreciate the widespread frustration stemming from the financial crisis, the recession,\nand the anemic recovery. But to go forward and tangibly improve things, we must use facts to\nguide our work, and must do a better job of sharing key facts and the data that underlie how and\nwhy the Fed takes the steps it does.\nLet me add as I always do that my comments reflect my perspectives, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Fed’s Board of Governors.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn recent years the U.S. central bank has taken unusual steps to combat a threatening\nfinancial crisis, a severe recession, and a disappointing recovery. By no means were we perfect,\nbut we acted in the public’s interest and I’m very supportive of the strong steps taken. I would\npoint out that the U.S. experience in the 1920s and 1930s, and Japan’s experience in recent\ndecades, show the even more dramatic economic pain that comes when central banks and\nnational governments act less than forcefully, or declare the crisis over too soon.\nHowever, the extraordinary steps the Fed has taken over the last four years have led to\nsome misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. Central banking and monetary policy are not\neasy to explain, but the Fed could have done a better job of it. But at the end of the day we’ve\nseen the creation of certain misconceptions, not supported by facts, about the U.S. central bank\nas an institution. The best way to address a misconception is to offer up the facts. So today I\nplan to address some of the misconceived assumptions about the Federal Reserve and our\nactions.\nIt is not surprising the Federal Reserve and other central banks have received an unusual\namount of attention of late. We are experiencing historic times, and an unusual confluence of\nevents. We experienced a global financial crisis which underlined the fact that financial markets\nand financial institutions have a significant impact on the real economy and all of its participants.\nWe have seen in dramatic fashion how increased global interconnectedness, despite its benefits,\nallows problems to quickly move across national borders. As a case in point, witness the\nreactions of our own U.S. financial markets to actions occurring, or not occurring, in Greece – a\ncountry of less than 11 million people, roughly the size of Ohio – and other countries. Add to\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthis the fact that, both here and abroad, fiscal problems have increasingly limited the response we\nwould normally expect in a severe economic downturn and a painfully slow recovery.\nThese events, taken together, have made forecasting the future path of the economy quite\nchallenging – and should instill humility about predicting the future, or how future shocks could\nimpact the domestic or world economy.\nIn response to the crises, the Federal Reserve has been forceful in trying to promote\ngrowth and thus reduce the unemployment rate, while achieving core inflation rates close to 2\npercent. Other central banks have too. Central banks2 have attempted to fight the crisis and\ndownturn by dramatically increasing their balance sheets (see Figure 1), buying non-traditional\nassets, and pushing short and long-term rates to new lows to try to create conditions that\nstimulate economic activity.\nUnfortunately, the creative and forceful response of many central banks to a bad\neconomic situation has not often been matched by fiscal policymakers and international officials.\nCentral banks cannot address these economic problems on their own. They can mitigate some of\nthe problems by reducing the cost of credit to individuals and businesses. And make no mistake,\nwhile the scale of the problem is great, that should not dissuade us from actions that make even\njust “a dent.” For instance, an action that reduces the unemployment rate by half a percent does\nnot bring us close to full employment, and does not solve the country’s problems, but\nnonetheless would perhaps create roughly 750,000 jobs that may not have been created in the\nabsence of the action.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFederal Reserve actions alone cannot solve all the problems affecting the domestic and\nworld economy. But the Fed can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of actions, and where\nactions can move us closer to better economic outcomes without substantial costs, it can and\nshould take action. In fact, that’s exactly what the Fed has been doing, and that is exactly what it\nshould be doing – consistent with the dual mandate given to us by Congress, to do what we can\nto achieve maximum sustainable employment consistent with stable prices.\nWith that introduction, allow me now to discuss four common misconceptions about the\nFed. To give you an overview, the four assumptions or misconceptions are as follows:\n•\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\n\n•\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\n\n•\n\n“Printing money” has caused serious inflation\n\n•\n\nRates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the\neconomy\n\nThere are of course a number of other issues we could discuss, but I think these are\nimportant and involve plenty for us to cover today.\n\nCommon Misconception 1:\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\nIn recent years there have been those advocating that the Federal Reserve should be\naudited. They are right in that the Fed should be audited – but they are mistaken in believing that\nthe Fed is not. In truth the Fed is a heavily audited organization subject to substantial oversight.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThis is entirely appropriate given the sensitivity of what central banks do, and the need to do it\nwithout reproach.\nIn truth,\n•\n\nall twelve Federal Reserve Banks employ professional internal auditors;\n\n•\n\nan outside audit firm, Deloitte & Touche, audits our financial statements;\n\n•\n\nthe Federal Reserve’s Inspector General, created by Congress, audits our activities;\n\n•\n\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office audits our actions, and\n\n•\n\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve System, provides significant oversight\nregarding Fed actions, as demonstrated by frequent requests to testify before\ncommittees – and by legislation over the years that has altered our role.3\n\nBut as one who loves data and facts, let me say a bit more to be quite specific on this\nmatter.\nWe produce an annual report that includes audited financial statements and a letter from\nme as CEO attesting to effective internal controls, based on the work of our internal audit and\nrisk-management teams. We include a letter from Deloitte & Touche attesting that we have\nmaintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are also audited by the Office of Inspector General, created by Congress to provide\nindependent oversight over the Federal Reserve – with the power to do investigations,\ninspections, audits, and reports. The Inspector General reports to Congress semi-annually – the\nmost recent report covers activities through March and is available on the web.4\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn Figure 2, I list some of the reports by the Inspector General over the past year, all of\nwhich are available on the Board’s web site. As you can see, the reports cover a wide range of\ntopics.\nWe are also audited by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which\nconducts audits, investigations, inspections, and reports on behalf of Congress. These reports are\npublicly available on the GAO web site. Figure 3 shows some of the GAO reports done in the\npast year regarding a wide variety of Federal Reserve activities. As with the Inspector General\nreports, one GAO report covers the operations of the Fed’s emergency liquidity facilities,\nincluding the one run at the Boston Fed on behalf of the System.5\nAnd we have direct oversight by Congress, which requests testimony on a wide range of\ntopics. Figure 4 lists some of the recent Congressional testimony provided by the Fed’s\nGovernors, all of which are available on the Board website. For the sake of brevity this figure\ndoes not include the testimony of staff other than Governors. Naturally, Congressional hearings\ninclude extensive questioning concerning our actions and policies.\nWe are an entity created by Congress. Congress can and does change our roles and\nresponsibilities over time. A good example is the Dodd-Frank legislation which increased our\nresponsibilities in some areas (like savings and loan holding company supervision) and curtailed\nour role in others (such as lending in “emergency and exigent” circumstances).\nSo in sum we are a heavily audited and supervised organization.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, I suspect that some who argue for more audits of the Federal Reserve may\nactually be advocating for the politicization of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve was\ndesigned by Congress to be a non-partisan organization that conducts monetary policy in the\npublic interest free of political influence. Good monetary policy in the public’s long-run interest\ncan involve unpopular decisions in the short run – such as the Volcker-era effort to rein in\ninflation using very high interest rates. Central banks in developed countries have become\nindependent of legislative bodies and the chief executive precisely because monetary policy has\nbeen shown to result in better economic outcomes (e.g., growth, and price stability) when it is\nnot influenced by partisan politics.\nI strongly believe that officials in the Federal Reserve conduct policy without regard to\npartisan politics, and to the best of their abilities try to administer monetary policy in the national\ninterest. This is a hallmark of our organization and should not change.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not audited and its\nactions occur without oversight. The fact is that the Fed is widely audited, and is subject to\nrobust oversight – which is as it should be.6\n\nCommon Misconception 2:\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\nWhen I first joined the Federal Reserve 25 years ago, the lack of transparency was a very\nvalid criticism of the Fed and most other central banks. However, the fact is that much has\nchanged in the last 25 years – and particularly in recent years.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nLet me admit that in the midst of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 one could fairly\nsay that we did not spend sufficient time explaining to the public the unique and extraordinary\nactions being taken. All I can say is that in the midst of the crisis there was a focus on solutions,\nand given the severity of the situation, this resulted in our spending less time communicating\nwell about what we were doing and why. Though no excuse, reacting to a crisis in real time\neffectively requires something else “give” – and we were frankly so preoccupied with\nextinguishing the fire we did not explain as well as we should have what we were doing and\nwhy. At the Fed we have tried since to explain precisely what we did and why, but we are still\nsome distance from being understood, or fully trusted for that matter.\nI think the Fed has learned from this. I would argue that at this point our organization has\nshifted a great deal compared to two years ago, and at this point we are quite transparent and\ngetting better at it in time.\nWhen I started at the Fed there was no explicit mention of our federal funds target after\nFederal Open Market Committee meetings, no minutes of the meetings, and no transcript\nreleased with a five-year lag. The minutes we provide now are quite detailed, providing a\nsummary of staff presentations, discussion of the views of all participants regarding the outlook\nfor the economy, and discussion of the debate around the policy recommendation.\nIn addition, we have started providing economic projections after each scheduled two-day\nmeeting – currently four times a year. This provides a summary of the forecasts by the twelve\nReserve Bank presidents and the Governors (currently there are five); on variables related to\ninflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of GDP. We provide both the range of forecasts\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand the central tendency of the forecasts. And the Fed is continuing to review its\ncommunications practices to ensure accountability and increase public understanding.\nAlso, after the four two-day FOMC meetings the Chairman now conducts a press\nconference. He fully describes recent policy decisions and the forecasts of the participants in the\nFOMC meeting, and answers questions posed by members of the press.\nAnd the Federal Reserve has also been communicating more directly with the public.\nThe Chairman has participated in a variety of what for central bankers are less traditional\nopportunities, from “60 Minutes” to various town hall style meetings, including one last week\nwith soldiers and their families on base in Texas.\nThe role of the Reserve Bank presidents has also evolved. Figure 5 lists the speeches I\nhave given this year that like today’s include a published text, charts, and an invitation to\nmembers of the media. The text and slides of this speech are available to anyone on our public\nweb site. When we can, we make video summaries available as well. We “tweet” some of the\nmain points.7 And at the end of the speech I will be answering whatever questions you would\nlike to raise.\nI also give a variety of informal talks that generally provide condensed versions of some\nof my previous public speeches. In addition, I have from time to time had interviews with\nmembers of the media working in print, radio, and TV. And I am not alone in this respect. My\npeers have similarly been trying to communicate more about actions we are taking on a range of\nissues, from monetary policy to supervisory policy to financial stability. We do not always agree\non policy matters and this in itself is an indicator of transparency.\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAlso, there are some areas in which the Federal Reserve is now being more transparent –\nin part with the encouragement of Congress. The emergency facility loans we made during the\ncrisis are listed on our web site, and information on “Discount Window” loans to banks are\nprovided with a lag.\nThe reason for this lag is straightforward – not secret for secrecy’s sake. As a lender of\nlast resort concerned about financial stability and the continuation of lending during times of\nfinancial turbulence, you want institutions that are in generally sound financial condition to turn\nto the central bank when there is a temporary shortage of liquidity in the banking system – in\nother words when they have liquidity but not solvency problems. In the parlance of monetary\npolicymaking, this prevents interest rates from rising significantly during a financial disruption.8\nHowever, immediate disclosure might cause financial institutions to view loans from the\nFed as stigmatized, possibly raising concerns with depositors and investors, and further\ncontributing to liquidity problems. The Dodd-Frank legislation wrestled with this issue and\ncame up with what I view as a reasonable solution – disclosure of Discount Window loans after\ntwo years.\nSo I fully acknowledge that the Federal Reserve has not always been very transparent –\nbut feel very comfortable attesting that there has been a rather dramatic change over the last two\ndecades, and in particular over the last few years. While we at the Fed continue to examine ways\nto better explain and describe monetary policy and other aspects of central banking, I would\nsuggest that there are now regular opportunities to hear from Federal Reserve officials directly or\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nvia the press, and I am glad that Fed officials are now much more publicly discussing policy\nactions.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not a transparent\norganization. The fact is that we are quite an open central bank – much better than we used to be\n– and are improving in this area even as we speak.\n\nCommon Misconception 3:\n“Printing money” has caused serious inflation\nFigure 6 highlights that both bank reserves and the total assets of the Federal Reserve\nhave grown substantially during the crisis, recession, and anemic recovery – with the most rapid\nexpansion occurring in the fall of 2008. The asset expansion is broken out in more detail in\nFigure 7. In the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the freezing up of short-term credit\nmarkets, the Federal Reserve established a variety of emergency liquidity facilities. Something\nthat is frequently overlooked is that over time all the loans were paid back with interest and the\nfacilities have been closed. The size of the Fed’s balance sheet has still continued to grow, as a\nresult of our large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities – policy actions\nwe took given the weak economy and our primary policy rate hitting the lower bound of near\nzero.\nHowever, while the most rapid growth in reserves occurred three years ago, Figure 8\nshows that over the three-year period ending last quarter the U.S. has experienced the lowest\naverage inflation rate of any such period over the past thirty years. Over the past three years,\ntotal personal consumption expenditures (PCE9) inflation has averaged only 1.2 percent.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 9 shows that in only two of the five most recent three-year periods has total PCE\ninflation been above 2 percent – and these two periods were ones where food and energy shocks\noccurred.\nWe have indeed expanded our balance sheet – some call that “printing money” – but it is\na misconception that it has resulted in significant inflation.\nThe reason why this is so is shown in Figure 10, which depicts loan growth at\ncommercial banks over the same three-year periods. Anemic loan growth in the credit crunch\nera of the early 1990s is one outlier on the chart, and the negative growth in the most recent\nthree-year period is another. In the recent period banks have become more risk averse, and have\nfocused (appropriately) on rebuilding their capital – while many borrowers have had their\nborrowing capacity weakened by the difficult business conditions of a severe recession and slow\nrecovery. The end result is curtailed lending. Bank reserves are not going to be inflationary\nwhen bank lending is not expanding.10\nLet me be quick to stress that inflation would be serious and detrimental at higher levels.\nI am not suggesting otherwise. I am just pointing out some facts that suggest it is currently very\nrestrained.\nIndeed, other market indicators show little evidence of concern over inflation. The 10year U.S. Treasury bond has fallen to around 2 percent, as shown in Figure 11. Similarly, other\ncountries where the central banks have expanded their balance sheets to fight the anemic\neconomic conditions also have very low 10-year government bond rates. Evidently investors\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nare not expecting large increases in inflation, or they would demand much higher rates to\npurchase long-term securities.\nAs everyone knows, high unemployment goes hand in hand with wages and salaries\ngrowing very slowly, at least for most jobs. Given the current conditions in the job market, there\nis little upward pressure on wages and salaries – and this means that there is little reason to\nexpect significant inflationary pressures as higher labor costs push up higher end prices. I would\nadd that while measures of money such as M211 have grown rapidly of late, much of that growth\nreflects investor risk aversion – investors moved funds to bank accounts during the debt ceiling\ndiscussion in August and in light of the European problems that have emerged more recently.\nFinally, I would note that one country where the central bank expanded its balance sheet\nsignificantly, some time ago, is Japan. The Japanese central bank began expanding its balance\nsheet more than a decade ago but rather than experiencing rapid inflation, they have been\nconcerned with deflation, as shown in Figure 12. Deflation – which is not my forecast at this\npoint, let me say – can be extremely difficult to overcome, as consumers expect products will be\ncheaper in the future, wages and salaries decline, and debtors face high real interest rates.\nMake no mistake, the Federal Reserve will need to remove its current policy\naccommodation as the economy improves. The current level of bank reserves would not be\nappropriate if we were at full employment – such accommodation would indeed be inflationary\nin that situation. However, that is not the situation the country is in now, and I fully expect we\nwill remove accommodation appropriately as the economy improves.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M.

While rates can be impacted by a variety of factors – for\nexample if the economy were to show signs of rapid growth you would expect rates to rise – 10year rates now are much lower than they were before we undertook our actions.\nIt is unlikely that lower rates would have no impact on the economy. Such an assumption\nwould be quite a leap of faith, because in general further lowering rates would:\n\n•\n\nimpact home purchases – because lower rates can have a big impact on cash flow of\nconsumers;\n\n•\n\nimpact consumer durables like cars – because auto-loan rates are one of the largest\npayments many people make each month;\n\n•\n\nimpact investment – because lower rates improve the potential benefit (the net present\nvalue) of investment projects;\n\n•\n\nimpact exchange rates and foreign trade – as suggested by the complaints heard from\nsome trading partners when the Fed has previously lowered rates;\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n•\n\nimpact inflation expectations, which impact real interest rates – given the evidence\nthat one-year inflation expectations did rise when the Fed announced its purchase\nprogram last year.\n\nResearchers at the Boston Fed have conducted statistical tests to determine if the reaction\nto long-term interest rates is different after the crisis, and whether there is empirical evidence that\nlower interest rates would indeed have no impact. Research by my colleague Giovanni Olivei\nhas found that prior to the crisis our statistical model of the economy would imply that a\nsustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would lead to a cumulative\nincrease in real GDP over two years of approximately 2.5 percent.\nWith the reduction in interest sensitivity in housing more recently, the model would\nimply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would now lead to\na cumulative increase in real GDP over two years of approximately 2 percent – as shown in\nFigure 13.12 Concerns with falling prices, high unemployment, and limited access to credit have\nlikely all contributed to this lower – but clearly non-zero – response to lower rates in housing\nmarkets.13 The assertion that our rate actions simply will have no impact is not supported by our\nstatistical work.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that rates are already low so further monetary\npolicy actions will have no impact on the economy. In fact, statistical analysis suggests the\nopposite.\n\n16\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nWe continue to experience unusual turbulence in financial markets. We had significant\nfinancial shocks that impacted the real economy during the crisis and recession, and we remain at\nrisk that financial shocks here or abroad could still impact our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve, like other central banks, has taken strong action to mitigate the\nimpact and avoid worse outcomes for the economy. As stated at the outset of my talk, the Fed’s\nactions have mitigated problems but we alone cannot quickly restore full employment. That will\ntake time and appropriate actions by international policymakers, U.S. fiscal policymakers, and\nmonetary policymakers.\nThank you for indulging me today as I discussed some common misconceptions about\nthe Federal Reserve. In sum, I believe the facts show that the Fed remains an organization with\nsignificant oversight, which has substantially increased its transparency, and continues to pursue\nactions consistent with our Congressional mandate to work to the best of our ability to achieve\nmaximum employment consistent with stable prices, in the national interest.\nThank you, and I would be happy to take a few questions now.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary’s primary definition of a misconception is “An incorrect interpretation or\nunderstanding.” I am also thinking of assumptions, which the same dictionary defines as “a statement accepted or\nsupposed true without proof or demonstration.”\n\n17\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Higher Education and the Economy”\nRemarks at New England Board of Higher Education’s “New\nEngland Works” Summit on Bridging Higher Education and\nthe Workforce\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 7, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today. I want to welcome all of you to the Boston\nFed and especially commend all the educators in the room for the work that you do. I benefited\nimmeasurably from my experience at Colby College as an undergraduate and at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison in graduate school. I am pleased now to have the opportunity to “give back”\nto both schools, in that I serve on an advisory committee for the economics department at\nMadison, and on Colby College’s Board of Trustees. These experiences give me a window into\nsome of the daunting challenges that you face, particularly in the current economic environment.\nToday I want to spend a few minutes discussing the nexus between what you do as\neducators and what I do as a central banker. Like a central banker should, let me first note that\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmy comments represent my perspectives, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Returning to\nthat nexus between what you and I do, at first glance it might seem as if there is not much\ncommonality. A case in point – generally when setting monetary policy, we assume we have\nlittle impact on demographic variables including the educational attainment of the workforce.1\nNot that such variables are unimportant, by any stretch, because we all know that the educational\ncharacteristics of the workforce play an important role in the dynamics of an economy. A welleducated work force is likely to be more productive, and highly skilled workers tend to have\nmuch lower unemployment rates in economic downturns.\nOn the other hand, as senior officials at colleges and universities, you likely view\nmacroeconomic conditions as something you have little control over. You focus instead on key\nmatters like educating students, worrying about raising funds for the endowments that are a key\ningredient to financial aid, and affording new and engaging educational programs. So while you\nmight take them as “given,” the recent recession has only highlighted how economic conditions\naffect how you go about educating students.\nI would like to suggest, however, that what educators do matters to the Fed and what the\nFed does matters to educators. I’ll touch briefly on some of the reasons why.\nAs you all probably know, the monthly U.S. employment report was released last Friday.\nThe unemployment rate is now 9.0 percent – a rate that remains stubbornly, and unacceptably,\nhigh. The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to improve the growth rate in the\neconomy. But economic “headwinds” – stemming from the previous financial crisis and\nconcerns about possible future financial shocks – have meant that despite Federal Reserve\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nactions, economic growth has been lethargic and job growth has been too slow to make\nsignificant inroads into reducing the unemployment rate.\nHowever, underlying the average unemployment statistics are a vast range of\ncircumstances, depending on educational attainment.\nToday I want to discuss some of those statistics and propose that as you and your peers\nare making admissions, financial aid, and retention-program decisions at your schools, you are\npowerfully shaping the outcomes for individuals – and society more generally. I also want to\nemphasize that institutions represented in this room play an important role in economic\ndevelopment in the communities in which you are located. There are important synergies\nbetween communities and schools of higher education. Schools are important anchors for their\ncommunities. They provide good and stable jobs for people in the area, and businesses that\nsupport the academic community benefit as well. They also bring in highly motivated students,\nsome of whom choose to use their education to form businesses in the communities where they\nwere educated. And of course the schools benefits, in many ways, from their communities.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Work Force\nIt is stating the obvious, but educational attainment is one of the defining characteristics\nof a workforce. Particularly in New England we tend to have highly skilled and highly educated\nworkers.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI would like to take just a moment to show how educational attainment is important not\nonly to individuals, but also to the communities they inhabit. In the current economic\nenvironment, the variation in unemployment by educational attainment is particularly striking.\nTo begin, let me draw your attention to Figure 1. As a result of a long and severe\nrecession, the unemployment rate has gone up dramatically for people in all categories of\neducational attainment, but no one will be surprised to hear that the levels of unemployment are\ndramatically different depending on educational attainment. Those with no high school diploma\nare experiencing more than three times the unemployment rate of those with at least a bachelor’s\ndegree. While the current unemployment rate is 9.0 percent percent, for those with at least a\ncollege education it is only 4.4 percent.\nIt is important to note that while the level of unemployment has varied by educational\nattainment, Figure 1 is not supportive of what economists call a “structural” unemployment\nexplanation for persistently high unemployment – such as when there are lots of open jobs that\ncannot be filled because the available workers have the wrong skill sets for those positions. As\nyou may know, evidence of a change in the structural level of unemployment has been a matter\nof significant debate among economists and policymakers. Figure 1 might provide some\nevidence that structural unemployment was a problem if, for example, unemployment had risen\ndramatically for lower-skilled workers but there was a shortage of highly skilled workers (that is,\ntheir unemployment rate had fallen).\nStimulating an economy where most of the unemployment is structural would place\nadditional demand on high-skilled jobs – causing rapid increases in compensation for those\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nworkers without generating improvement in the overall unemployment rate, as the supply of\nhighly educated workers would be slow to respond.\nBut we see quite the opposite right now, because people at all levels of educational\nattainment have experienced a substantial increase in unemployment, as shown in Figure 2. In\nfact, if one compares the percentage increase in unemployment by category of educational\nattainment, it is striking what a high percentage increase in unemployment has occurred in each\ncategory. This is consistent not with the “mismatch” dynamic of structural unemployment but\nwith a story of weak demand throughout the economy.\nOn this subject I would recommend a recent paper by economists Bob Triest and Bill\nDickens, presented last month at the Boston Fed’s annual economic conference. They provide\nimportant evidence on employment flows – evidence that is consistent with most of the\nunemployment being driven by inadequate demand, rather than structural problems.2\nA look at the compensation data in Figure 3 provides additional evidence that structural\nunemployment cannot explain the persistently high unemployment rate. If most of the current\nunemployment were structural, we would expect to see compensation increasing as employers\nbid for scarce high-skilled workers. But as the figure shows, compensation growth has slowed,\nand remains quite low relative to compensation over the past 30 years.\nSimilarly, Figure 4 shows there has been no great divergence in compensation trends\nacross occupations. If a skills mismatch existed, one would expect wages in the sectors where\nsupply is short to be accelerating, while wages would be declining in sectors where there was\nexcess labor supply. We do not see this happening. Growth in compensation for management\nand professionals – presumably a higher skilled occupational category – has not shown evidence\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof sharp acceleration relative to occupations that one would presume have somewhat lower skill\nrequirements, such as work in natural resources, construction, and maintenance.\nIn fact, Figure 5 presents the increase in labor costs over the past nine quarters (since the\nbeginning of the recovery) by occupation, and it does not show dramatically different growth in\ncompensation by job type. In fact, management and professional occupations have seen\ncompensation grow less than workers in natural resources, construction, and maintenance over\nthese nine quarters of recovery.\nThis is just some of the evidence that suggests why the notion of rising structural\nunemployment cannot explain the high aggregate unemployment rate we are unfortunately\nexperiencing. This distinction is very important to the policy response. Of course, for\nindividuals it should be noted that employment prospects are significantly improved with\neducational attainment.\nBut educational attainment affects far more than just employment prospects. The lefthand chart in Figure 6 shows the relationship between median household income and\neducational attainment. While the median income of all households is approximately $50,000,\nthere are substantial differences based on educational attainment. Those with no high school\ndiploma have less than half the median income, and those with just a high school diploma (no\ncollege experience) have about three-quarters of the median income. And those with\nprofessional degrees have more than twice the median income.\nAnd the right panel of the figure shows that growth in median income over the past two\ndecades also varies substantially by educational attainment. For example, those with only a high\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nschool education have experienced a significant decline in median real income where the most\nrapid growth has been for those that have received doctorate or master’s degrees.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment also translates into significant differences in\nnet worth. Those with college degrees have more than triple the net worth of those that do not.\nOver the last two decades, those with college degrees have had a significant increase in their real\nnet worth – while in contrast, those with no high school diploma have substantially less net\nworth, and their real net worth has declined over the past two decades. Of course, the causation\ncan work in both directions here, especially with regard to inherited net worth – that is, parental\nwealth makes it easier to afford higher education.\n\nThe Implications\nFigure 8 shows that the U.S. workforce is becoming more educated. There has been a\nsubstantial increase in the number of people in the workforce that have a bachelor’s degree or\nhigher. Given the employment, income, and net worth differentials shown in earlier charts, it is\nnot surprising that an increasing number of high school students are realizing that higher\neducational attainment is in their interest.\nHowever, underlying this positive trend are sharp differences across racial categories.\nFigure 9 shows that educational attainment differs substantially by race. While Asian\nindividuals have been particularly successful in obtaining college degrees, African-Americans\nand Hispanics in the labor force significantly lag in educational attainment. This lack of\neducation makes it much more difficult for them to maximize their potential, given the evolving\nwork-force needs in the US economy.\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI think there are a number of potential implications for educational leaders from this\nanalysis. As you consider whom to admit, how much of an endowment to spend to provide\nfinancial aid, whether financial aid should be in the form of grants or loans, and how those scarce\nfunds should be allocated, I would urge you to keep in mind that you are making choices that are\nnot only important for individuals but for society more generally. And I would urge public\npolicymakers to keep similar notions in mind when they consider budgetary investments in\npublic and community institutions.\nIndeed, income and net worth differences are highly related to educational attainment, as\nI have shown. Insuring that children have adequate preparation, from early childhood education\nthrough high school, is critically important. And it is critical that those whose families have\nlimited financial means are not shut out from the opportunities an education provides. In short,\nfinding ways to encourage greater educational attainment – particularly for low and moderate\nincome families and those racial groups that have traditionally been underrepresented – will be\nan important determinant of the quality of the U.S. work force and the income distribution in our\ncountry.\nSimilarly, many of your institutions are in cities that have been hard hit by the economic\ndownturn and tepid recovery, making it even more important – to a macroeconomic policymaker\n– that you reach out to affected communities, and view your institutions as anchors of\ncommunity economic development. Certainly the location of this conference, in Boston,\nhighlights the tangible benefits that can accrue to a community when it has great colleges, and\ncollege leaders that take the development of their communities seriously.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFinally, I am pleased to note that many schools have become better at bridging their\nstudents to the working world. I would strongly encourage using alumni networks and other\nresources to provide students with internship opportunities. A vibrant New England needs a\nvibrant work force, and internships can be an important way for communities to attract and retain\ntop talent.\nHelping the region attract and retain talented college students is one reason the Boston\nFed partnered with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce to provide a better clearinghouse\nfor college internships in the Boston area. I would encourage your institutions’ career offices to\ndirect students looking for internship opportunities to the web site that has been set up.3 We and\nour partners hope it will continue to grow and provide many opportunities in the greater Boston\narea over time.\nI have described the Boston Fed’s research that highlights the important role that\neducation plays in our regional development. Let me touch briefly on other policy work that we\ndo and describe what is currently a major concern to us. At the Boston Fed it is central to our\nmission to explore ways that U.S. monetary policy – entrusted by Congress to the Federal\nReserve System – can promote maximum employment with stable prices. My own forecast is\nthat inflation is likely to be below 2 percent over the next several years, in part because of the\nvery weak labor markets. Given the very weak labor market conditions and the low expected\ninflation rate, the Federal Reserve should in my view continue to take action to aggressively try\nto reduce the stubbornly high U.S. unemployment rate.\nBut clearly the Federal Reserve cannot do it alone. Given the sobering macroeconomic\nsituation, it is important that fiscal policy, controlled by the federal government and the states, do\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nits part. It is also important for international policy makers to take actions that provide more\nstable world markets. But at the same time, in my view the Federal Reserve should continue to\nuse the tools at its disposal to boost demand in the economy. And at the same time, we would do\nwell to work on addressing any impediments to students getting the employment opportunities\nthat will serve them, their communities, and the macroeconomy.\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today, and to take a few minutes to explore the nexus\nbetween higher education and the macroeconomy. Thank you for having me.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nI am aware, of course, that investment in human capital through schooling may have a degree of sensitivity to\ninterest rates.\n2\n\nSee their paper at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/LTE2011/papers/dickens-triest.pdf.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Global Financial Intermediaries:\nLessons and Continuing Challenges”\nAddress at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston’s\n56th Economic Conference:\nThe Long-Term Effects\nof the Great Recession\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 19, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nI’d like to reiterate the welcome to conference participants that I offered yesterday.\nThank you for being here to take part in this conference on the long-term effects of what many\nhave come to call, sadly, the “Great Recession.” I hope that the ideas and analysis exchanged at\nthis conference will help alleviate the effects of this downturn and the slow recovery, as well as\nhelp prevent future problems from causing so much hardship for so many.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI should mention that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nAs I – and others – have noted many times, a key lesson from the recent downturn and\nprior financial crises is that problems in financial institutions and financial markets can and do\nspill over to the real economy, very significantly. Policymakers must worry about the financial\nsystem and markets because problems there can disrupt the financial intermediation on which\nmarket economies depend.1 When this happens the economy suffers, and the economic\nprospects of its participants.\nGiven the severity of the recession that followed the recent financial crisis, it is crucial\nthat our financial infrastructure becomes resilient enough so that financial intermediation can\ncontinue, regardless of a shock, without extraordinary intervention from the public sector (the\ngovernment and, ultimately, taxpayers). During 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Congress, Treasury\ndepartment, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve all took\nextraordinary actions to avoid a more-severe financial crisis and more damage to economic\nprospects. Despite this unprecedented public-policy response, the recession was long and severe\nand the recovery continues to be much slower than we would like. And the United States was\nnot unique in this respect. Many foreign governments and foreign central banks also took\nunprecedented action to try to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis in their countries.\nParticularly noteworthy is how many large global financial intermediaries experienced\nsevere distress. These institutions play a vital role in the credit flows and financial\nintermediation that underpin the global economy. They span national borders and presumably\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhave the ability to be better diversified across products and geographic locations than smaller\ninstitutions or intermediaries doing business in just one country.\nBut because these global intermediaries are key players in many countries and in many\nfinancial markets, and because they are highly interconnected with other financial institutions,\nthey also serve as particularly efficient conductors or transmitters of shocks in one area to the\nwider global financial system. Unfortunately, such was the case with the major shock caused by\nresidential real estate problems in the U.S. More recently it appears to be the case with the\nsovereign debt problems in Europe.\nAs you know, there have been significant legislative and regulatory responses to the\nfinancial crisis that emerged in 2007. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank legislation made\nsignificant changes to frameworks for addressing systemically important financial institutions,\namong other things. Internationally, many of the impending Basel III rules are similarly\nintended to address some of the lessons of the financial crisis.\nI am very supportive of these efforts, but I suspect they can be strengthened and\nimproved. Indeed some countries, such as the U.K. and Switzerland, are fairly far along in\nestablishing standards that are higher than those required by Basel III. But in my view some\nsignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system in which\nno institution is “too big to fail” given the collateral damage its disorderly demise would cause to\neconomies and citizens.\nBefore the new domestic and international rules could be fully implemented, the world\nhas once again been buffeted by financial shocks, this time emanating in Europe. And once\nagain large financial intermediaries, despite all the positive roles they play in facilitating global\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncommerce, have been efficient in transmitting or conducting the shocks. As a result the world\neconomy has slowed, and stock prices of large financial intermediaries have fallen significantly.\nOnce again, governments have started to intervene to mitigate global banking problems,\nwhich in turn may stress the debt burden of those governments, and could ultimately undermine\nthe credit ratings of some countries. While the full impact of sovereign debt problems and their\nimpact on large financial intermediaries will not be known for some time, it is apparent that the\nfinancial intermediaries encompass some vulnerabilities for the world financial system and the\nglobal economy.\n\nConsidering the Large Financial Intermediaries\nGiven the key role that large financial intermediaries played in the crisis of 2007 and\n2008, as well as their role in the problems that have arisen more recently, it is important to\nunderstand why financial intermediaries contribute vulnerabilities to the global financial system.\nSo I’d like to provide some background on the large intermediaries and their potential for\nconducting shocks around the global economy.\nFigure 1 explores bank size relative to the size of the home country, specifically the asset\nsize of the largest bank in each country as a share of GDP.2 When financial intermediaries\nbecome large relative to the GDP of the home country, several potential challenges exist.3 First,\na large institution could essentially be “too big to save.” Should a global bank become insolvent\nand the home country need to recapitalize it – so that it can continue its crucial role in financial\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nintermediation within the economy – then the sheer scale of the required equity capital could\nstrain a country trying to raise sufficient funds to provide the equity.\nConsider a hypothetical example. A troubled two trillion dollar bank located in a country\nwhose GDP is also two trillion dollars would in all likelihood put the country in a position of\nneeding to issue government debt to finance an equity infusion. If the government recapitalized\nthe bank with 10 percent more capital, the nation’s debt to GDP ratio would increase by 10\npercent. If multiple banks failed at the same time, the national debt to GDP ratio would rise even\nfurther. Thus while government rescue of a bank may stem an individual institution’s crisis, it\ncan precipitate sovereign debt concerns.\nIreland’s recent experience is instructive. The Irish banks were not among the world’s\nlargest financial intermediaries, but they were large relative to the size of their home country’s\neconomy. Prior to its banking crisis, Ireland was a country with a relatively low debt to GDP,\nbut became a country with a high debt to GDP ratio – largely as a result of providing emergency\nequity support for its troubled banking sector.\nNow I would like to direct your attention to Figure 2, which shows the pricing on\nsovereign credit default swaps for a number of countries. Credit default swap (CDS) rates for\nmany countries are now very high by historical standards – meaning the cost of insuring against\na sovereign default has risen appreciably. While I know that thin trading in credit default swaps\nfor individual entities necessitates caution in their interpretation, the overall trend is clear. A\ncountry needing to recapitalize one or more of its financial intermediaries faces further fiscal\nstrain – potentially at a precarious time, when investors have already become more cautious\nabout trends in the country’s debt to GDP levels.\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAnother potential problem arises when investors have little confidence in a particular\nglobal bank or the home government. In this case, simply recapitalizing the bank may not be\nsufficient to address concerns, and additional financial support by the country may be necessary.\nFor example if depositors rapidly withdraw their deposits from a troubled bank, the home\ncountry may need to support deposit holders in addition to providing equity (capital) –\nparticularly in countries where deposit insurance regimes are not robust, or payment of\ndepositors’ claims is not timely.\nWhat’s more, a failure to support the liabilities of a troubled bank (in this case the\ndeposits) would potentially destabilize other banks in the country, even those with relatively\nhealthy balance sheets. Compared to simply infusing capital, supporting liabilities could require\nmuch larger expenditures by the home country and thus the home country would need to\ncontribute substantial additional funds.\nYet another issue concerns the reliance of large financial intermediaries on so-called\nwholesale financing arrangements. As you know, retail depositors are frequently covered (to\nvarying degrees) by deposit insurance, so in countries with credible deposit insurance\nframeworks, retail depositors covered by insurance are less likely to “run.” In contrast, however,\nwholesale funds – such as very large certificates of deposit, and commercial paper – tend to\nmove out of troubled banks relatively quickly. Thus banks that depend heavily on wholesale\nfunding can potentially experience a fairly sudden liquidity crisis. Such crises force\ngovernments to make quick decisions about providing support – decisions that have important\neconomic ramifications for their countries.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nDiscussing these concerns is not an esoteric exercise. Figure 3 shows the average credit\ndefault swap spreads for largest financial intermediaries, in groups of five.4 As I just mentioned,\none needs to use caution in reading too much into credit default swap rates – but they do indicate\nthat similar to credit default swap spreads on countries, financial firms around the world have\nseen a marked increase in CDS spreads. The cost of insuring against default has gone up\nsubstantially relative to the beginning of the financial crisis. Suffice to say for many banks, the\nrates remain quite elevated at present.\nFigure 4 shows stock price declines at the largest bank by country (and for countries with\nmore than one bank in the top 20 in assets, the declines are averaged). Bank stock prices have\ndeclined substantially since the beginning of the year. Many large financial intermediaries have\nexperienced significant declines and market prices already reflect concerns with financial\nintermediaries outside and inside Europe. Figure 5 provides stock-price data on the largest\ninstitutions in Europe and the U.S., again in groups of five, including the average change from\nthe peak to the current level, and from the end of 2010 to the current level for each group of\nbanks.\n\nOutstanding Issues Related to Large Financial Intermediaries\nThe Basel III capital accord is designed to reduce the risk that large financial\nintermediaries will become troubled and require government intervention. While there are a\nvariety of proposed requirements in Basel III, two major initiatives include potentially raising\ncapital requirements for systemically important institutions – to reduce the probability they\nbecome insolvent – and improving the ability of large financial intermediaries to withstand\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nliquidity shocks. These are important and necessary improvements, and the overall accord is an\nimportant step in the right direction. Yet some important outstanding issues remain to be\naddressed. I would like to mention some key ones, which of course are more interrelated than\nstand-alone.\n\n1. Resolution of large financial intermediaries\nThe first outstanding issue involves the challenge of resolving a failing international\nfinancial institution. Different countries have very different bankruptcy frameworks and\nresolution arrangements, and these differences can significantly impact who gets payment in a\nrestructuring. These differences remain a major impediment to orderly resolution.5\nAs seen in Figure 6, related to absolute priority in liquidation, there are significant\ndifferences across countries, particularly related to the treatment of secured creditors and\nemployee claims. These differences mean that the place where funds “reside” in a global\norganization will determine which creditors get paid. Knowing this, there is the potential for the\norganization in danger of failure to shift funds (prior to closure) to countries where the treatment\nof particular classes of creditors is favorable to the organization.\nA disorderly failure of a global financial institution can be extremely damaging.\nCreditors may not know which jurisdictions hold valuable assets. They may be unclear on the\nprevailing bankruptcy rules, how these rules affect their positions, or how long their funds will\nbe tied up. The situation surrounding the failure of Lehmann Brothers is quite relevant here.\nThree years after the bankruptcy, significant litigation continues. Some creditors were impacted\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nby the movement of funds in the final days before bankruptcy, and many creditors still do not\nknow the amount they will receive or the timeframe in which they will be paid.\nThe failure of several Icelandic banks also highlights the problem. While small by\ninternational standards, the troubled banks were large relative to the size of the Icelandic\neconomy. Uncertainty about whether depositor claims (particularly foreign depositors’ claims)\nwould be satisfied – and by whom – highlights the difficulties that can emerge when even\nrelatively small institutions fail.\nSuch uncertainty could provide depositors and creditors with a strong incentive to remove\nfunds from a troubled global financial institution. This may mean that large financial\nintermediaries could be particularly susceptible to the rapid withdrawal of deposits due to\nuncertainty surrounding resolution. Needless to say, this is particularly problematic at a time of\nfinancial stress.\nIdeally, international agreements would govern cross-border claims on global institutions.\nHowever, as the table highlights, differences in national views on which creditors should get the\nhighest priority make obtaining an international agreement quite elusive, at least any time soon.\nThere are fundamental legal and cultural differences in national insolvency and resolution\nregimes – including differences in insolvency criteria; which parties can initiate an insolvency\nproceeding; whether the debtor or an administrator is in charge; the time for payment of claims;\nset-off and preference rules; and others.\nWhile a uniform approach to creditor hierarchy would arguably enhance financial\ninstitution resolution and financial stability efforts globally, the likelihood of harmonizing the\narray of entrenched national creditor hierarchies would seem to be unlikely in the near term.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nMoreover, these differences are unique and important to individual countries. Consequently,\ninterim or alternative measures seem appropriate. But I hope I have helped illuminate a key\nchallenge that could make an orderly failure of a large institution potentially elusive.\n\n2. Wholesale financing of large financial intermediaries\nA second outstanding issue involves large financial intermediaries’ reliance on wholesale\nfunding arrangements. Many large financial intermediaries raise funds across international\nborders, so the location of their creditors may well differ from the location of their assets. This\nsituation is quite prevalent among many large European banks that have raised funds in the\nshort-term credit markets for commercial paper and jumbo certificates of deposit, in order to\nfund longer-term assets either in the United States or elsewhere in their global operations.6\nBut this practice of raising short-term dollar liabilities to fund longer-term dollar assets\ncan make the financial institution less stable if global creditors come to feel less certain about the\ninstitution’s prospects (or the prospects of a class of institutions). In fact, Figure 7 shows that\nthe cost of raising dollar liabilities through the use of foreign exchange swaps has increased\nsubstantially this year – an indicator of creditor concern about such institutions.\nThis reliance on wholesale liabilities – compared to retail liabilities like deposits that\nusually enjoy deposit insurance – makes a large financial intermediary more susceptible to\nliquidity pressures. This is precisely why the new Basel III requirements devote significant\nattention to the liquidity and funding strategies of large financial intermediaries.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAdditionally, during periods of distress there is a natural incentive for regulators in a\ngiven country to “ring fence” some operations of a global bank within their borders – in other\nwords to prevent any bank assets from leaving the country in order to maximize funding\navailable to meet their liabilities to domestic creditors. Such a policy could make it difficult for\nlarge financial intermediaries to continue funding – particularly wholesale funding – across\nnational borders.\nAs long as the sources and uses of funds in such situations differ because of national\nborders and related regulatory and legal requirements, the ability to resolve a global bank will be\ncomplicated, giving rise to concerns about the risks of broad financial contagion. I would add\nthat if we are to avoid future crises and the need for extraordinary government intervention in\ncrises, then the issue of over-reliance on wholesale funding will need to be addressed.\n\n3. Protection of home country operations\nA third lingering issue concerns the protection of home country operations. An\nalternative being explored in the United Kingdom and in Switzerland – areas with global\nfinancial intermediaries that are large relative to their economies – is whether in some\ncircumstances the public sector will only support the domestic operations of their banks. By\nring-fencing responsibilities, the home country government will be better able to forestall a crisis\nin their country. However, other countries could be adversely affected if subsidiaries and\nbranches in their jurisdiction must “fend for themselves.”\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAgain, the Icelandic example highlights the problem of small countries supporting large\nfinancial intermediaries, and whether the home country and its regulatory authority and\ntaxpayers can be expected to be willing and able to serve as a source of strength should the bank\nbe in danger of failing, or fail. It is exactly these concerns that have caused some countries to\nrequire that all branches of foreign banks operating within their borders be supported by capital\n(sometimes referred to as full subsidiarization).\nThe benefits of creating a subsidiary with deposit insurance and access to the Federal\nHome Loan Bank system would likely change the nature of their U.S. operations. By requiring\ncapital against all assets in the country, financial firms are more likely to depend on a more\nstable mix of liabilities – including retail deposits, wholesale funding, and term debt – rather than\njust wholesale deposits. And the capital in the country would provide additional protection to\nmeet domestic claims should the global parent become troubled. Alternatively, the domestic\noperations would be more readily salable, which could potentially reduce the spread of\ndifficulties and limit the disruption of crucial financial intermediation. However, this solution\nalso comes at a cost – as risk management, liquidity management, capital management and\nregulatory requirements become more costly to the parent, since all financial operations in a\ncountry are now subject to the regulatory requirements of that host country.\n\n4. Reluctance to be proactive in retaining and raising additional capital\nA fourth outstanding issue involves the reluctance of bank management or regulators to\nbe proactive in retaining and raising additional capital for an institution or for groups of\ninstitutions. Basel III provides new restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends as their\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncapital becomes depleted. However, book and regulatory capital measures tend to be lagging\nindicators of the financial strength of the bank. Some financial intermediaries have experienced\nlarge declines in share prices and large increases in the pricing on credit default swaps, but still\ncontinue to pay dividends or buy back shares.\nGiven the support of governments to large financial intermediaries around the world in\n2008, a more proactive approach to retaining capital within organizations during times of stress\nis in my view warranted – a view I have expressed a number of times in various talks. If\ntaxpayer funds in a country may be used to bolster a bank due to its critical role as a financial\nintermediary in the country’s economy, that step should not manifest itself in paying scarce\nfunds to equity holders.\nMoving to a structure where an institution’s dividends are deferred during times of\nfinancial stress would greatly facilitate the increase of capital buffers at times when investors are\nconcerned with a given bank’s financial performance. Using easily observable financial triggers,\nsuch as very substantial declines in a firm’s stock price, to pause share repurchases and dividends\nwould provide no additional information about the institution’s financial strength – but would\nallow it to build up capital during times of stress.\nThe amount of necessary government support for large financial institutions globally\nshould provide a strong incentive for the capital requirement aspects of Basel III. In fact, it is\nnotable that proposals in both the U.K. and Switzerland are calling for significantly higher\ncapital requirements than in Basel III, to reduce the need for future interventions by those\ngovernments.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, during 2008, governments around the world were forced to intervene to\nprotect the global financial system. The Dodd-Frank legislation provided significant regulatory\ntools to address the “too big to fail” problem. However, three years after the failure of Lehmann\nBrothers, there remain significant impediments to avoiding the need for government intervention\nto protect large financial intermediaries. Everyone knows that some large European financial\ninstitutions have of late encountered problems. So it is critical that we focus on strengthening the\nfinancial architecture, so that the struggles of one institution or a group of them no longer poses\nrisks to the broader global economy.\nSignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system\nwhere no bank is too big to fail given the collateral damage it would cause to economies and\ncitizens. I hope that this conference and others like it will be part of the important process of\naddressing these outstanding issues and challenges.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nI discussed my definition of financial stability, and the implications of the definition, in a talk earlier this\nyear at the Stanford Financial Forum. I noted that in my view “Financial stability reflects the ability of\nthe financial system to consistently supply the credit intermediation and payment services that are needed\nin the real economy if it is to continue on its growth path.” And “Financial instability occurs when\nproblems (or concerns about potential problems) within institutions, markets, payments systems, or the\nfinancial system in general significantly impair the supply of credit intermediation services – so as to\nsubstantially impact the expected path of real economic activity.” The talk is available at\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm.\n\n2\n\nThis includes the U.S., and all European countries with a bank ranked among the top 50 worldwide as of\nDecember 31, 2010.\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Global Interdependence Center’s\nConference on Capital Markets in the Post Crisis Environment\nStockholm, Sweden\nSeptember 29, 2011\n\nI am very happy to be with you for this substantive conference on capital markets in the “postcrisis” environment. It is vital for policymakers and practitioners to study and apply the recent\nlessons of financial interdependence, given the obvious effects on public wellbeing. So I am glad to\nbe able to join you in these discussions. And I commend the Global Interdependence Center for\norganizing this event, and others like it.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC). That is a standard disclaimer for Fed officials, but I really do mean it. My\ncomments should not be construed as official Fed perspectives or policy, but rather one person’s\ncarefully considered perspectives, based on much study. Let me also mention that my charts, and the\nanalysis I will share with you today, are all built on publicly available data.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nMy intent today is to offer up some constructive observations that I believe will help us move\ntowards greater financial stability, to the benefit of all. We need to create a more stable financial\ninfrastructure and I believe we can, in a thoughtful manner.\nFor the second time in four years, problems with financial institutions have captured the\nattention not only of economists, but also the mainstream press and the public at large. Given the\nimportance of credit to economic performance, we should reflect on why our financial system seems\nso susceptible to shocks, and on how we can strengthen its resilience so government intervention is no\nlonger necessitated by such shocks. My hope is that bankers and central bankers can once again be\nrelegated from the front pages of our newspapers to the business sections.\nYesterday I had an opportunity to participate in an economic outlook forum and discuss some\nof the challenges in the real economy – specifically in housing – that we are trying to address in the\nUnited States. Today I’d like to shift somewhat from the real economy directly, and focus on more\nunderlying financial-market challenges.\nIt goes without saying that this is an important time to be discussing financial markets. Global\nfinancial markets are being buffeted by concerns about the challenges facing various financial\ninstitutions, in part as a result of issues with fiscal imbalances in a number of countries. This\nheightened uncertainty is occurring despite the aggressive monetary policy actions taken in response\nto the recent recession – actions that at first blush would seemingly mitigate some of these challenges.\nConsistent with our mandate, the Federal Reserve acted aggressively when financial\ndisruptions emerged and the economy faltered. After cutting the federal funds rate essentially as far\nas possible, the Fed took less traditional policy actions, again to pursue our mandate. Figure 1 shows\nthat bank reserves in the United States have increased dramatically. We have increased the size of the\nFederal Reserve balance sheet, providing over a trillion dollars in additional bank reserves – yet even\nso, dollar funding markets have experienced strains.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 2 highlights that interbank markets are showing more strains as the spread between the\n3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate has widened.\nThis is happening even though most banks are loath to post higher rates for fear of signaling financial\nchallenges.\nAlso reflective of the current strain is Figure 3, which essentially shows the cost of utilizing\nderivatives contracts to secure dollar funding. It shows the spread between the 3-month dollar cash\nrate implied by a 3-month euro-dollar FX swap, and 3-month dollar LIBOR. Under normal\nconditions the line should be quite close to zero, but during periods of dollar funding problems, the\nspread can widen. As the chart shows, the spread is now at the widest it has been in the past several\nyears.\nSo how can there be a shortage of dollar funding at a time when there are so many bank\nreserves? One answer lies in the structure of short-term funding markets – a structure that has\nevolved to a state that is, unfortunately, particularly sensitive to liquidity shocks.\nToday I will highlight that the structure of the U.S. money market mutual fund (MMMF)\nindustry1 -- and the practice of many financial institutions to fund long-term dollar assets with shortterm dollar liabilities – have both helped make the global financial system susceptible to liquidity\nshocks and (relatedly) to changes in the perceived credit risk of market participants.\nI will first discuss the role that MMMFs play in providing short-term funding, including\nserving as an important source of short-term financing for European banks. I will highlight that the\ncurrent structure makes MMMFs particularly susceptible to credit shocks that can turn into liquidity\nproblems for the whole industry – and will suggest some ways that the industry could be made more\nresilient.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAnd I will then turn to the practice among some European banks of funding long-term dollar\nassets with short-term paper purchased by MMMFs. This too, has proved to be a structure that makes\nshort-term credit markets susceptible to liquidity shocks.\nI will conclude with some general observations about the current stresses in financial markets.\n\nThe Role of Money Market Mutual Funds in Short-Term Credit Markets\nMMMFs are mutual funds that provide investors the ability to invest in a diversified set of\nshort-term credit-market instruments. Because MMMFs generally invest in highly liquid, high\nquality, short-term credit instruments they are not required to alter their net value to reflect small\nmovements in underlying asset values. The resulting stable (versus floating) net asset value makes\nthe investments attractive to investors looking for a transactional account that generally has paid a\nsomewhat higher return than comparable bank products.\nLike other mutual funds, MMMFs are not required to hold any capital as protection against\nadverse movements in the value of the assets they hold. This absence of capital, together with the\nstable net asset value, results in a structure that despite its appeal in other ways is prone to shareholder\n“runs” during times of financial stresses.\nMMMFs have been viewed as appealingly safe investment vehicles for investors seeking\nhighly liquid investment opportunities. As a condition of transacting at a stable net asset value, the\nMMMFs, which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are required to\nmaintain significant liquidity ratios and are limited in the duration and credit ratings of the financial\ninstruments they can hold.2, 3\nMMMFs are critical players in short-term credit markets. They have been very significant\nbuyers of commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. MMMFs\nhave provided an important source of financing for organizations dependent on wholesale financing,\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nincluding branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. – I will discuss them in a\nmoment – and others that issue short-term credit instruments to finance longer-term dollardenominated assets.\nAs Figure 4 illustrates, MMMFs are sizeable participants in financial markets with about $2.5\ntrillion of assets under management. They grew rapidly for much of the last decade, but encountered\nsignificant problems in the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers. One MMMF, the Reserve\nPrimary Fund, had a position in Lehman Brothers and was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value\n(“broke the buck”) after Lehman failed and the value of its commercial paper plummeted. This led to\nrapid withdrawals from many MMMFs (a “run”) as investors became concerned that other MMMFs\nwould not be able to maintain their stable net asset value.\nIn response to the rapid withdrawals, the U.S. Treasury announced a temporary insurance\nprogram for MMMFs. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston administered on behalf of the Federal\nReserve System a lending facility that was designed to address the short-term liquidity needs of\nMMMFs and help stabilize short-term credit markets that were disrupted by the rapid liquidation of\ninvestments by many MMMFs.4,5 These efforts proved successful at restoring stability and avoiding\nfurther harm, and all of the loans were repaid with interest.6\nSince then, balances at MMMFs have gradually declined – by more than a trillion dollars from\ntheir peak – over the past three years in response to the historically low interest rate environment and\ncorresponding returns.\nFigure 5 shows the three major categories of MMMFs, determined by the assets in which they\ninvest. The prime money market funds are the largest category, with approximately $1.5 trillion in\nassets. The prime funds have the most flexibility in investing and are allowed to hold commercial\npaper, jumbo CDs,7 and asset-backed commercial paper as well as government-backed securities.\nThe second largest category, with approximately $850 million in assets, involves MMMFs that invest\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nin U.S. Treasury and agency securities. These funds have lower credit risk, but also generate lower\nreturns. The smallest category involves MMMFs that provide tax-free returns to investors.\nAt the time of the Lehman Brothers failure, prime MMMFs that had credit-sensitive investors\nand exposure to large financial institutions experienced the largest and most rapid redemptions.8\nMany investor outflows from prime funds were redirected to MMMFs that were government-only\nfunds.\nMMMFs have substantially increased their liquidity over the last year. In part this reflects a\ntightening of liquidity requirements by the SEC, but it also reflects the realization among MMMF\nmanagers that during times of significant liquidity risk, they need to maintain a more defensive\nposture. As Figure 6 shows, prime funds have been increasing their holdings of short-maturity assets\nof late – in part, one assumes, as a result of the debt ceiling concerns in the U.S. and the funding\nworries related to governments and financial institutions in Europe.\nSince MMMFs have increased liquidity in an environment of very low returns on short-term\ncredit instruments, their returns to investors have been squeezed further. Figure 7 illustrates the\nimpact on MMMF returns. The first line in the table provides the average yields for the five highest\nyielding MMMFs, and the second line provides the average yields for the next five highest yielding\nfunds. The table highlights that while the gross yield averages about 40 basis points for the five\nhighest yielding MMMFs, investors are only getting a net yield of only five basis points.\nMMMFs have purchased a large amount of foreign-bank securities. But as Figure 8 shows,\nmost MMMFs have been reducing their exposure to European banks that the market may see as\nposing more significant credit risks. Some of the reductions have been quite dramatic, and MMMFs\nare no longer holding short-term credit instruments issued by institutions headquartered in the most\nfinancially strained countries. They have greatly reduced the size of their overall exposure, and have\nalso significantly reduced the maturity they are willing to hold.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nHowever, one of the challenges for the MMMF industry is that, just as in the fall of 2008, a\nvery few aggressive MMMFs – maybe even one – could under certain circumstances encounter\ntrouble that ends up ratcheting up redemption requests across the industry.\nNo one wants to see a repeat of 2008, nor should we. The industry and all participants can get\nto a better place. For example, an examination of the publicly available monthly reports on portfolio\nholdings of MMMFs highlights that a few MMMFs hold financial paper that has not been\ndowngraded but nonetheless is seen by the market as posing more credit risk than could seem\nappropriate for entities that are allowed to maintain a fixed net asset value.\nMMMFs have been required to provide a monthly report of holdings and have increased their\nliquidity. Still, we are passing the three-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman and the run on the\nMMMFs and it remains important to explore the ways that the industry, which plays a pivotal role in\nshort-term credit markets, can address its susceptibility to a credit shock that could in turn be\ntransmitted to short-term financial markets. I am not saying anything that has not been expressed\nbefore, but want to highlight the opportunities we all have to move thoughtfully but expeditiously to a\nmore stable place.\nGiven all this, I believe a more proactive regulatory approach may be necessary. While the\nmonthly reporting has been helpful, given the very short maturity of many of the assets, I believe the\nreporting should be more frequent to avoid the possibility of “window dressing” at the end of the\nmonth. Also, reducing a fund’s maximum permissible exposure to any one firm could reduce the\npotential loss that would occur from a credit event involving only one counterparty. Consideration\nmight also be given to whether the assets of riskier firms (for example those with very high market\ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) prices are appropriate investments for MMMFs, which are expected to\nmaintain a low risk profile.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nThere have been a variety of proposals recommending more substantial changes in this arena.\nHowever, three years after a systemically significant episode, no one proposal has been settled on.\nMy own preferred approach would be to require MMMFs to have a meaningful capital-like\nbuffer that exceeds, for example, their single-issuer concentration exposure limits – perhaps on the\norder of 2 to 3 percent – that, if violated, automatically leads to a fund’s conversion to a floating net\nasset value. Examples of how to structure such a buffer include having the MMMF’s sponsor directly\nfund the creation of the buffer, or creating a separate class of loss-absorbing shares that could be\nmarketed to investors willing to bear some risk in exchange for a higher return than that provided by\nthe stable value shares. If in some appropriate period of time a satisfactory plan for such a capital\nbuffer is not produced and accepted, then those prime funds would be required to float their net asset\nvalue.\nAll in all, though, given the systemic importance of the MMMF industry, it is critical that one\nway or another we make the industry less susceptible to credit shocks and liquidity runs. While many\nin the MMMF industry have been reducing their exposure to troubled financial institutions, some\ncontinue to take what some observers might consider outsized credit risks. The experience of 2008\nshowed the potential for a MMMF’s problems to precipitate redemptions that are ultimately\ndestabilizing to short-term credit markets, and contribute to economic difficulties. I am certainly not\npredicting any such outcome but noting that policymakers, market participants, and the industry can\nand should make steady progress on these matters.\n\nForeign Branches and Agencies in the United States\nThe consideration of MMMFs is intertwined with another issue of systemic risk that I would\nlike to discuss – the dependence, to a large degree, of foreign branches and agencies in the U.S. on\nshort-term wholesale funding.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nLet me first note that while I will raise some concerns in this arena, we are beginning to\naddress them within the existing statutory framework. However, over time other structural remedies\nmay be warranted and possible.\nUnlike domestic banks or foreign bank subsidiaries in the U.S., foreign branches and agencies\nare not allowed to have U.S. deposit insurance and thus cannot rely on insured retail deposits as a\nfunding source. In addition, foreign banks are ineligible for membership in, and receiving secured\nfunds from, the Federal Home Loan banks – which have been an important source of liquidity for\nmany domestic banks. As a result, they are especially reliant on wholesale funding – that is, raising\nfunds by issuing jumbo certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements; all of\nwhich during times of stress are less stable than typical retail deposit accounts.9\nParenthetically, I would note that foreign branches are not required to directly hold any capital\nwith their U.S. operations. I will say more on this in a moment.\nWhile wholesale funding is an important part of a bank’s liability structure, an excessive\nreliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance long-term assets can be problematic. In\nparticular, in situations where wholesale financing is not available, foreign branches can find it\ndifficult to raise required dollar funding and the foreign parent may not be able to fill the funding gap\neffectively. This is one of the reasons why foreign banks were among the most aggressive users of\nthe Fed’s liquidity facilities and Discount Window in the wake of the run on MMMFs in the fall of\n2008.\nForeign branches and agencies utilize wholesale dollar deposits for two main purposes. First,\nthey use the short-term wholesale deposits to fund longer-term U.S. dollar bank loans and securities\nholdings. They frequently fund large corporate borrowing needs. Second, the branches are often used\nto raise dollar funding for their global parent. Thus, branches frequently provide longer-term funding\nto their parent to fund dollar assets the parent is holding outside of the branch.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nI will say a fair amount about foreign branches today, so I want to stress that the focus stems\nfrom the important and useful function that they serve as a source of finance in our global economy.\nFigure 9 provides the major components of foreign branch assets. These are principally loans\nand leases and securities holdings such as high-grade corporate securities. In addition, you can see\nthat foreign banks have been attempting to increase their liquidity in case their access to wholesale\nfunding becomes constrained – as reflected in the sharp increase in cash and bank reserves.\nFigure 10 provides the major components of foreign branch liabilities. Roughly 75 percent of\nbranch liabilities are generated by jumbo deposits, commercial paper and other borrowing, including\nfinancing through repurchase agreements. One of the primary sources of these funds are the\nMMMFs.\nUsing shorter-term wholesale funding (in branches) to fund longer-term assets held by the\nbranch or the parent proved problematic in the fall of 2008. The investor run on money market funds\nforced the funds to stop acquiring new (and “rolling over” existing) jumbo deposits and commercial\npaper, causing a serious funding problem for the issuing entities. Short-term credit markets became\nseverely stressed, requiring significant government intervention to restore liquidity to the market.\nConcerns over problems in Europe are once again posing a problem for the strategy of shortterm wholesale funding of longer-term U.S. dollar assets. Despite the large supply of bank reserves I\nmentioned earlier, a reduction in MMMF financing has once again resulted in a problem for\nwholesale dollar funding. The recent announcement of several central banks that they would provide\nlonger-term dollar financing has once again highlighted that short-term credit markets are, in my own\nopinion, overly dependent on structures that are highly sensitive to credit and liquidity conditions.\nOver time it will be important to get to a place where adequate funding flows do not require official\nintervention during times of stress.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAs with MMMFs, a greater focus on financial stability should cause a re-evaluation of\nstructures with no direct capital and a clear reliance on rolling over short-term liabilities to fund\nlonger-term assets. The foreign branch system is important because of the role it plays in U.S. credit\nmarkets and also because of the dollar funding it facilitates for foreign banks, facilitating global\ncommerce. However, it does suffer from some of the same problems as the money market funds.\nThere are a number ways to try to reduce these liquidity problems associated with the current\nbranch structure. Clearly this issue requires much careful thought and analysis, so what I’ll suggest\ntoday should be viewed only as examples of possible approaches that could be taken.\nOne supervisory approach could be to preserve the current branch structure but take steps to\nreduce funding risks in various ways.10 It may be advisable to require greater liquidity from global\nparents. And I would note that several of the Basel III Capital Accord’s liquidity measures will make\nreliance on wholesale funding less attractive.11\nSecondly, regulatory approaches that have been taken in some countries require foreign\nbranches to hold capital, or require all bank operations to be under a separate holding company\nstructure with capital to support the entirety of domestic operations in the country. Requiring capital\nfor all domestic operations of foreign banks has costs.12 But it is one option, worthy of study.\nBoth of these approaches would in all likelihood cause firms to reconsider whether a more\nstable funding model – for example a more stable mix of funds including wholesale, insured, and\nlonger-term debt – could be superior to purely wholesale funding.\nWhile we should actively consider a variety of options, my personal preference would be to\nmove towards all foreign banking operations requiring some form of bank capital. This approach\ncould reduce the liquidity crises that have occurred episodically, and could also address the possibility\nthat as some banks have become large relative to the size of their countries, it could be difficult for\nparents to back up branches during a crisis.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAll in all, I would suggest that the financial stability issues raised in 2008, and which have\nbecome increasingly prevalent of late, require a reexamination of issues that influence the stability of\nshort-term credit markets.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum and in conclusion, short-term credit markets have become increasingly susceptible to\nrapid shifts in sentiment – shifts that can create global liquidity problems. The structure of MMMFs,\neven with improvements that make them less at risk of runs, can still cause problems – for example if\nMMMFs move assets quickly out of certain segments of wholesale funding markets. This could\nhappen because of increased credit concerns on the part of either money-market investors or moneymarket managers.\nAnd foreign banks that have become dependent on MMMFs and other sources of wholesale\nfunding are another concern. As in 2008, now in 2011 we are seeing dollar shortages as MMMFs\nshun some financial institutions with various exposures to troubles in Europe – a situation that is\nhaving a negative impact on short-term credit markets.\nAll in all, the global banking system currently remains more vulnerable than it should and\ncould be. And more than just the liquidity structure is problematic. Some global banks appear to\nhave lost the confidence of more than the MMMFs. Share prices have fallen dramatically for some\nbank stocks, and credit default swap prices for some global banks are at elevated levels.\nBank supervisors worldwide may do more to utilize these market signals when deciding\nwhether banks should be allowed to issue dividends or make share repurchases. Using market\ntriggers as well as capital triggers to prevent capital from leaving the banking system (or to bolster it\nas necessary) during times of stress should be revisited. Should market assessments be wrong, banks\nwould only have deferred dividends or share repurchases. They could be resumed at a higher level\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nonce the problems are resolved. Furthermore, using publicly observed signals to trigger a cessation of\ndividends may have less of a market impact than dividend reductions based on management\njudgment.13\nAllowing dividends and share repurchases to occur when the risk of a crisis is high allows\nscarce capital to leave the banking system at a time when it is most needed. Such a policy risks that\ntaxpayers, debt holders, and the economy will suffer should bank capital be insufficient to weather the\ncrisis.\nIf market triggers were hit and bank supervisors became concerned about credit availability\nfrom the financial system, in certain circumstances they could choose to suspend dividends and stock\nrepurchases for all systemically important banks. This would retain capital in the banking system and\nallow the stronger banks to continue their important role as financial intermediaries at a time when\nsome of their peers are constrained by their financial problems. While Basel III has proposed dividend\nreductions as capital becomes depleted, I suspect that is likely to be too late, given the slow pace at\nwhich accounting losses are realized.\nIt has become clear that financial stability is too central to the performance of economies not\nto explore options for moving forward and reducing instability. We need to move constructively and\nprudently to a better place, and I believe we can and should.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe analysis presented here includes 2a-7 funds but, in fact, a broader definition of money funds can be considered\nwhen discussing the structure and the sensitivity to liquidity shocks.\n2\n\nUnder section 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act – that is, under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 2a-7 (17\nCFR 270.2a-7) issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Rule 2a-7).\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\n3\n\nThey cannot hold securities with a maturity greater than 13 months, and the average maturity of their assets cannot\nexceed 90 days. The securities have to be of low credit risk, and a fund can have no more than 5 percent of its assets with\nany one issuer.\n4\n\nGiven the disruptions, the Federal Reserve System announced an asset-backed commercial paper MMMF liquidity\nfacility. The facility, operated for the System by the Boston Fed, allowed money market funds to sell asset-backed\ncommercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale proceeds to meet redemption requests – and the asset-backed\ncommercial paper was pledged by the banks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back\nwith interest.\n5\n\nFor more on this episode see my remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum in June:\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm\n6\n\nSee “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility” (QAU Working Paper No. QAU10-3\nby Burcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick M. Parkinson, Eric S. Rosengren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul S. Willen). The working\npaper explains that following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, short-term credit markets were severely\ndisrupted. In response, the Federal Reserve implemented new and unconventional facilities to help restore liquidity. Many\nexisting analyses of these interventions are confounded by identification problems because they rely on aggregate data.\nTwo unique micro datasets allow us to exploit both time series and cross-sectional variation to evaluate one of the most\nunusual of these facilities—the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF).\nThe AMLF extended collateralized loans to depository institutions that purchased asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)\nfrom money market funds, helping these funds meet the heavy redemptions that followed Lehman’s bankruptcy. The\nprogram, which lent $150 billion in its first 10 days of operation, was wound down with no credit losses to the Federal\nReserve. Our findings indicate that the facility was effective as measured against its dual objectives: it helped stabilize\nasset outflows from money market mutual funds, and it improved liquidity in the ABCP market. Using a differences-indifferences approach we show that after the facility was implemented, money market fund outflows decreased more for\nthose funds that held more eligible collateral. Similarly, we show that yields on AMLF-eligible ABCP decreased\nsignificantly relative to those on otherwise comparable AMLF-ineligible commercial paper.\n7\n\nSome funds restrict their investments to FDIC insured CDs. The foreign branch CDs tend to be jumbos.\n\n8\n\nThese are shareholders redeeming their equity investments.\n\n9\n\nDuring times of stress it may also be more difficult to rely on the foreign parent organization for support, as it may be\nunder stress as well.\n10\n\nSteps could include increasing liquidity concentration; limiting the level of receivables from related entities; requiring\nthat any such receivables be collateralized by high-quality assets held at the parent; increasing diversification in third party\nfunding; establishing funding tenor limits, so that branches hold less shorter-term wholesale funding; requiring that\nbranches collateralize some of their third party funding with high-quality collateral; and requiring branches to better match\nthe tenor of assets with the tenor of liabilities they hold.\n\n11\n\nHowever, in this regard it depends upon how the rules for “significant currencies” are enforced.\n\n12\n\nFor example, banks would have less flexibility to move liquidity and capital across borders, and maintaining separate\nrisk analysis by country could raise costs for global banks.\n13\n\nSince by construction the public trigger approach conveys no negative information about the bank’s earnings prospects\nbeyond what the market already knows.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2011 AT 2:50 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Economic Outlook Seminar\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nSeptember 28, 2011\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be in Sweden to participate in today’s session on the current economic\noutlook and tomorrow’s conference on capital markets in the post-crisis environment. It is vital that\npolicymakers and practitioners study and apply the recent lessons of the global economy and financial\ninterdependence, so I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nOn a personal note, I should mention that my grandfather John Johanson left Sweden at the\nage of six, changing his name to Rosengren and joining his father – who was deploying what he had\nlearned as a gardener in Sweden to open greenhouses in America. My relatives were able to take\nwhat they had learned in Sweden and apply it – with perhaps some variation – in the United States. In\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\na similar way, there is much to consider about the economic experience in Europe and the U.S. over\nthe past four years. What is similar? What is different? And what can be learned and applied?\nThe window into these broader questions that I would like to use today is housing. One of the\nhallmarks of the recent financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruption, has been the very\nsignificant role played by unusually large movements in residential real estate values, within and\nacross countries.\nGiven our setting today, let me start by comparing U.S. and Swedish home price movements\nsince 1995, shown in Figure 1. In the U.S., house prices increased steadily and reached a peak in\n2006, before beginning an unprecedented decline – not just in selected regions of the country, but\nnationally – resulting in aggregate declines of more than 30 percent. In contrast, Swedish real estate\nprices increased even more substantially, and have not experienced any substantial decline. Indeed,\nthey continued to rise after the global financial crisis.\nWhile the U.S. housing price decline was a nationwide phenomenon, there were relatively\nmore severe declines in some parts of the country, such as the so-called “sand states” of Florida,\nArizona, Nevada, and California. Figure 2 shows the home price declines in various metropolitan\nareas (a subset of those included in the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index) and the lines drop\nfurthest and fastest for the metro areas in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California.\nAs I talk with economists from countries whose housing values have risen markedly but not\nexperienced sharp declines, I have been struck by two things. First, they are often confident that\nnational (versus regional) house-price reductions are unlikely. And secondly, most assume that a\ndecline in house prices would have a measured impact on the economy should that in fact occur. But\nthe experience of Japan in recent decades and the U.S. more recently1 should provide some caution –\ngiven that the economic retrenchment that followed these significant declines in home values\nexceeded most people’s expectations.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nWhile sustained rapid increases in house prices are frequently followed by significant\ndeclines, I am certainly not predicting price declines in any country, given my limited knowledge of\nmarket characteristics. But I do recommend a thoughtful consideration of the recent U.S. experience,\ngiven its severity and the fact that it was not foreseen. Indeed, while residential investment2 now\ncomprises only 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the U.S., our housing problems have\nhad a tremendously disproportionate impact on economic performance and on the recovery of growth\nand employment.\nI would like to discuss some of the reasons for that disproportionate impact today. By way of\npreview, let me mention that I plan to highlight the following points.\nFirst, while housing is a small component of U.S. GDP, it is also quite volatile. Historically,\nan outsized proportion of U.S. economic growth in the first two years of a recovery from a recession\nis generated by residential investment. The sector is very responsive to monetary policy3 since the\nability to purchase a home can be quite sensitive to the interest rate and the resulting cost of financing.\nSecond, the characteristics of a country’s mortgage-finance market determine the impact that\nwill come from a change in the rates directly influenced by monetary policy. In the U.S., most homes\nare financed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, so a fall in long-term interest rates really only affects\nexisting home owners to the extent they refinance. As a result, the U.S. gets less effect from the\nmovement of short-term, monetary policy interest rates compared to countries where the primary\nmortgage financing instruments are floating-rate loans. In countries with this institutional feature,\nboth new and existing home buyers get more immediate boosts from lower short-term rates. Figure 3\nhelps to illustrate this by showing the greater responsiveness of U.S. adjustable-rate mortgage rates to\nthe target federal funds rate, versus 30-year fixed-rate loans.\nThird, many U.S. financial institutions have significant exposure to real estate, either through\ndirect lending or through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, declines in real\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nestate prices can have a substantial impact on the capital of financial institutions, which impacts their\nability to finance not only the housing sector, but also other sectors of the economy.4\nFourth, falling home prices have not only impaired the capital of many financial institutions,\nbut in a very real sense have disrupted the transmission of monetary policy. This is because falling\nhome prices have brought about a situation where the availability of credit is more important in many\ncases than the cost of credit. Borrowers may not qualify for lower rates – in other words, the credit\nmight not be available to them – because their household balance sheet is weaker than prior to the\nrecession, because the collateral values of homes and commercial real estate have fallen, and because\nlender perception of risks inherent in the economy and in collateral valuations has risen – all at a time\nwhen lenders’ capital has been depleted.\nFifth, I will argue that changes in some housing policies in the U.S. could make it less difficult\nfor monetary policy to affect the economy when housing prices have fallen.\nI will also discuss the actions taken last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the\nhousing sector and the economy more broadly. I am very supportive of these actions.\nLet me stress that I know housing markets have critical institutional features that differ greatly\nacross countries – including financing arrangements, mortgage insurance, the role of government, tax\ntreatment, mortgage servicing, and borrower liability in foreclosure. This makes it difficult to\ngeneralize from the U.S. experience.\nWhat may be transferable, however, is the observation that sharp declines in housing prices\ncan have additional negative effects, with broad implications for macroeconomic outcomes and\nmonetary policy – broader, perhaps, than may be assumed and incorporated into most statistical\nmodels of the economy. I don’t intend to talk about whether housing prices will fall, but rather want\nto emphasize that when they do fall the effect on the economy is often much greater than many people\nexpect.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nLet me pause to mention at the outset that a number of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve\nare studying and speaking about these important issues. Most recently Elizabeth Duke, a member of\nthe Fed’s Board of Governors and herself a former banker, spoke at the Board’s Policy Forum on the\nHousing Market Going Forward and I recommend her address to you.5 I share Governor Duke’s\nview that in the U.S. we “currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance that it is\nhampering our economic recovery.” I may not be as convinced as she is about one possible remedy –\nthat banks may be suitable landlords upon converting foreclosed properties to rentals – but I\nrecommend absorbing her perspectives on things that can be done in the near term to help the housing\nmarket stabilize and rebalance.6\nAlso, colleagues at the Boston Fed including Paul Willen and Chris Foote have done a great\ndeal of empirical work on these issues, and are exploring the key institutional characteristics of the\nhousing market that play important roles in the current problems. Among other things, they are\nworking on estimates of the macroeconomic effects of possible refinancing plans.\n\nThe Role of Housing in the Slow U.S. Recovery\nThe decline in housing prices has created a multitude of difficulties for the U.S. economic\nrecovery. I would like to provide some evidence of the problem, and discuss its origins.\nThe housing sector in the U.S. played a major role in the recent financial crisis, and in making\nthe recovery from the resulting recession so anemic. In the U.S. we had seen regional declines in\nhome prices during previous recessions, but had not seen a national decline in house prices in the\npost-war era. So for most lenders, investors, and homeowners, the sustained and substantial decline\nin home prices was not anticipated. Even sophisticated investors had placed only a very small\nprobability on such a correlated decline. A key lesson from the past several years is that homes are\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nnot riskless investments – and that highly rated, regionally-diversified mortgage securities do not\nnecessarily carry low risk.\nAs mentioned earlier, even though residential investment is a small share of GDP (today only\n2.2 percent), it is quite interest-sensitive – it can decline quite dramatically as interest rates rise, and\nexpand quickly when interest rates are relatively low. So it has been a disproportionally important\npart of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.\nIn the current situation, however, U.S. mortgage rates are quite low but residential investment\nhas not been the engine of growth that it normally is in economic recoveries. As shown in Figure 4,\nexports have been a source of strength in the first two years of the U.S. recovery, and business fixed\ninvestment has grown at approximately the same rate in this recovery as in the previous three. Yet the\nhousehold sector has been particularly weak. Consumption, which accounts for approximately 70\npercent of U.S. GDP, has grown only about half as much in the first two years of the recovery as it did\nin the previous three recoveries. And the shortfall for residential investment is even more striking. In\nthe previous three recoveries, residential investment grew over 30 percent on average in the first years\nof the recovery – but has actually decreased in the first two years of this recovery.\nFigure 5 explores this pattern further by showing the contributions to total GDP growth that\nresidential investment has provided in the first and second years of recent recoveries. In the past three\nrecoveries, residential investment on average contributed more than 20 percent of GDP growth in the\nfirst year and 10 percent of growth in the second. So in the typical recovery, residential investment\ncontributes much more to growth in the first two years of the recovery than would be expected given\nits share of GDP. This reflects the fact that interest rates generally fall during a recession and the\ninitial stages of a recovery – and residential investment is usually quite responsive to interest rates.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nIn this recovery, residential investment was only a small share of the growth in the first year of\nthe recovery and declined in the second year. So the unusually slow recovery is, in part, due to the\nuncharacteristically muted response of residential investment to very low interest rates.\nMore than one observer has commented that we are seeing a different pattern this time that\nequates almost to a “negative feedback loop.” High unemployment leads to risk aversion, which\ndecreases demand for new housing. But without construction activity we are not seeing the typical\nuptick in housing-related jobs.\nHaving said a bit about residential investment and the slow recovery, I would like to now\ntouch on other problems that stem from the decline in housing prices. Because residential investment\nis not the only facet of the economy that is affected by the drop in home values.\nIndeed, the decline in housing prices has contributed to a sharp decline in household wealth.\nIn fact, Figure 6 shows (in both dollar and percent terms) that there was a significant decline in\nhousehold net worth from 2005 to 2009, and that it particularly impacted racial and ethnic minorities\nin the U.S.7 These insights are drawn from a Pew Research Center study that used data from the\nCensus Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.8\nTo explore this a bit more, Figure 7 shows that while homes are an important component of\nnet worth for Americans regardless of racial and ethnic group, African American and Hispanic\nhouseholds are particularly reliant on home values as a share of their wealth (between 50 and 60\npercent, versus between 30 and 40 percent for White and Asian households in the U.S.). While stock\nprices have increased substantially from their crisis lows, those households whose primary source of\nwealth is their home have been disproportionately affected by the decline in house prices. And\nintuitively, households whose net worth has been significantly impacted are likely to reduce their\nconsumption levels by more than households whose net worth has recovered.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 8 shows the erosion in home equity for U.S. households, again in both dollar and\npercent terms. Home equity is not only a source of funds to finance consumer purchases, but also\nfrequently serves as a source of funds for individuals starting new businesses. With the decline in\nhome equity, many entrepreneurs do not have that route available to finance start-ups or to expand\nexisting small businesses.\nThe weak housing sector also has an impact on employment. Figure 9 shows that far fewer\njobs have been created in the first two years of this recovery (the left bar in each pair) than in previous\nrecoveries (the right bar in the pair). In fact, construction jobs have continued to decline during the\nfirst two years of this recovery – we have lost over a half a million construction jobs since the\nrecovery began. While construction employment is typically volatile during a recovery, on average\nthe sector adds roughly 150,000 jobs.\nIndeed, Figure 10 shows that employment in construction has declined by 9 percent in the\nfirst two years of this recovery compared to growth over 4 percent during the previous three\nrecoveries. And weak construction employment and activity also reduces the demand for labor in\nsectors that support construction.\nFigure 11 highlights that the rate of mortgage delinquency in the U.S. has been much greater\nduring this recession than in previous ones. Despite two years of recovery (albeit a very slow one),\nthe mortgage delinquency rate remains well above the peak level seen over the previous 30 years.\nAnd Figure 12 shows that with significant foreclosures and a weak economy, both the housing\nvacancy rate and the rental vacancy rate remain quite high by historical standards.\nSo the problems in housing have greatly complicated the recovery in the U.S. Not only has\nresidential investment been unusually weak, but “to add insult to injury” consumption, business\nformation, and employment have also been affected by problems in the housing sector.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nHousing’s Impacts on the Policy Response\nMonetary policy in the U.S., entrusted to the Federal Reserve by Congress, has responded\naggressively to both the severe recession and the weak recovery. Short-term interest rates were cut\nessentially to zero.\nHitting the so-called “zero lower bound” has certainly brought challenges to the ability of\nmonetary policy to stimulate the economy. However, once the zero lower bound was reached, the\nFederal Reserve used a variety of tools to try to push down longer-term interest rates, as merited by\neconomic conditions. Our efforts have included asset purchases both traditional (Treasury securities)\nand nontraditional (mortgage-backed securities). We have also altered our communications strategy.\nAt the August FOMC meeting we announced that the Fed expects to maintain short-term interest\nrates (the target range for the federal funds rate) near the zero bound at least through mid-2013 unless\nthere is a significant improvement in economic conditions relative to our forecast, and as long as the\ninflation outlook remains subdued.9 At the September FOMC meeting we announced a plan to extend\nthe maturity of our holdings of securities and reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency\ndebt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The recent\nactions have helped lower long-term interest rates significantly, which is intended to promote growth\nin interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.\nFigure 13 shows that in the U.S. the 10-year Treasury rate, and 30-year mortgage rates, have\nreached historically low levels. Figure 14 illustrates that the combination of low rates and falling\nhouse prices significantly improved the affordability of homes.10 In addition, Figure 15 shows that\nboth population and household formation in the U.S. have continued to rise over the past five years.11\nThe problem is, while many households have been able to refinance and some new home\nbuyers have taken advantage of the improved affordability of houses, falling home prices have made\nmany unable to refinance, and many unable or unwilling to purchase a home. While the housing\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nmarket would have been more severely impacted (and housing prices fallen more substantially) had\nthe Federal Reserve not eased monetary policy aggressively, the impact of our policies on the\neconomy has clearly been impaired by falling housing prices.\nMonetary policy would have had a greater impact if households were able to respond to the\nlower interest rates as if house prices had not fallen. The data can help one gauge the scope of the\npotential. The widely followed CoreLogic estimate is that as of the second quarter, 10.9 million, or\n22.5 percent, of all mortgaged residential properties had negative equity, where the debt exceeds the\nvalue of the house.12 These so-called upside-down homeowners typically have a much harder time\nrefinancing than owners with positive equity.\nAlong these lines, CoreLogic estimates that about three-quarters of owners with negative\nequity are paying \"above-market\" interest rates, which the company defines as rates above 5.1\npercent.13 By contrast, slightly more than half of positive-equity owners are paying above-market\nrates. All in all, CoreLogic estimates that there are about 28 million borrowers who are paying abovemarket rates and thus might potentially benefit from a refinance.14\nThere are several proposals that attempt to facilitate refinancing for homeowners who have\nbeen negatively impacted by the drop in housing prices. These proposals do face hurdles, including\nhow to address private mortgage insurance and second liens. However, a program that made it\npossible for many homeowners to refinance, even if they were upside down, would likely provide\nsignificant reductions in mortgage payments to individuals who are likely to have a relatively high\npropensity to consume. Clearly getting more money into the hands of homeowners who would spend\nit could help to fuel GDP growth. This would reduce one of the impediments to a more significant\neffect from the monetary policy actions taken to date.\nI hasten to add that there is already a government program to allow underwater borrowers to\nrefinance, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). This program allows underwater\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nborrowers with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans to refinance at lower rates. Unfortunately, the\nprogram has helped fewer borrowers than was originally hoped. Fed Governor Betsy Duke outlined\nsome of the potential reasons why, in the talk I mentioned earlier. They include loan-level price\nadjustments (LLPAs) that raise interest rates for many borrowers and thereby reduce the benefit of\nrefinancing; originator worries about “buybacks” forced on them by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;\njunior lien-holder resistance to re-subordinating their loans; and mortgage insurance policies.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now investigating whether there are ways\nto enhance the program to benefit more borrowers.15 As this work proceeds, I hope the FHFA\nconsiders dropping or reducing LLPAs in cases when a GSE loan is refinanced into another GSE\nloan. Such a refinance actually reduces the GSE’s credit risk (they already guarantee the existing\nmortgage and the homeowner will be able to take advantage of lower rates, freeing up cash flow).\nA second potential way to help resuscitate the housing sector would be to facilitate the\nreduction in the number of vacant homes.16 One way to do this would be to help responsible investors\npurchase vacant homes and then convert them into rental properties. Today, a majority of investor\ndeals are financed with cash, which suggests that there is room for improvement in the financing of\ninvestor properties.\nA step in the right direction is a new loan product from Fannie Mae that allows a cash-out\nrefinance of properties purchased with cash within the past six months, helping to “recycle” investor\ndollars through the market. But more could be done. Two possibilities include allowing investors to\naccess FHA 203(k) purchase-rehab loans and increasing the cap on the number of Freddie Mac loans\nthat are available to a single investor. In short, improving access to credit for responsible investors to\npurchase and improve properties would not only help provide affordable rental housing. It would also\nhelp to boost housing demand and limit some of the collateral problems from the large supply of\nvacant homes.17\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nA third way to help today’s housing market would be to provide as much certainty as possible\nregarding future government policy in this area. The GSEs are likely to play a different role in the\nnew system.18 The uncertainty has real effects on how well our current system works. A case in point\nconcerns GSE repurchase requests on delinquent loans.19\nFinally, I would like to be able to guarantee that the United States will never again suffer a\nsignificant house-price decline. But instead I can suggest some improvements that could make the\nhousing market of the future more robust in the face of disruptive shocks. One suggestion concerns\nspeeding up20 the resolution of delinquent mortgages that have no hope of becoming current again.\nThe government’s Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program (HAFA) is intended to speed\nthe resolution of troubled homeownerships by offering monetary incentives to borrowers and\nservicers who agree to short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. But like the larger HAMP program,\ntake-up rates for HAFA have been disappointing.21\nThe ultimate solution may be to rethink the foreclosure process from the start, and economic\ntheory could play a role here.22 By influencing the costs and benefits of non-foreclosure transfers, a\nnew system of ownership transfer might better align the incentives of borrowers and lenders, while\nstill protecting the legitimate property rights of homeowners. If so, society as a whole would benefit.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would reiterate that problems in the housing sector of the U.S. economy have\nbeen a major impediment to recovery. As you know, we took significant actions last week at the\nFOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly. 23\nI am very supportive of the actions, which were designed to promote stronger growth and\nreduce unemployment rates, consistent with our dual mandate, by putting downward pressure on\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nlonger-term interest rates and helping make financial conditions more accommodative. The actions\nannounced last week involve extending the average maturity of our holdings of securities, by selling\n$400 billion of Treasury securities with maturities of less than three years, and purchasing $400\nbillion in securities with maturities of from six to thirty years. I would highlight that 29 percent of the\nsecurities being purchased are in the maturity range over 20 years.\nThe FOMC also announced that to support conditions in mortgage markets we will now\nreinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities\nin agency mortgage-backed securities, rather than purchasing Treasury securities.\nThere was a substantial market reaction to the announcement. Thirty-year Treasury yields\ndeclined by 18 basis points and thirty-year mortgage rates declined by 22 basis points that day – and\nfell further the following day.\nPictured in Figure 16 is the spread between the 30-year mortgage yield (a wholesale yield)\nand the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread illustrates in part what the Fed's actions are addressing –\nthe upward movement in the spread since mid 2011 – and the market's reaction, a 17-basis-point drop\nin the spread, following the Fed’s announcement. Since some of this action had been anticipated and\nalready reflected in market prices, I view this as a very significant decline.\nWhile there are a variety of impacts that lower long-term Treasury and mortgage yields can\nhave, certainly one is encouraging more refinancing and home purchases than would happen in the\nabsence of action. In my own view, the Federal Reserve should continue to closely monitor spreads\nbetween mortgage and Treasury yields and consider taking action if that spread widens significantly,\nas it had recently.\nWhile the housing sector and the economy would have been weaker in the absence of the\nFed’s actions to lower rates, I believe it is equally important to examine housing policies that might be\nchanged to reduce the impediments to monetary policy and more generally help facilitate recovery.\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nThere should be strong encouragement for the GSEs to focus on the housing recovery so home buyers\nand those that already have loans can fully benefit from the lower interest rates generated by our\nmonetary policy action. Given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently under conservatorship\nby the U.S. government, I believe they should play a larger role in achieving the public policy goals\ninherent in addressing these housing-market problems.\nWhile monetary policy cannot fully offset the many problems stemming from the recession, it\ncan certainly mitigate some of the effects. A policy action that, for instance, reduces the\nunemployment rate by half a percent over time will not return the economy to full employment, of\ncourse, but will still mean 750,000 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of the action.\nOf course, carefully weighing the potential costs of additional action with the expected potential\nbenefits involves a high degree of uncertainty, given we have not operated at the zero bound with\nfalling housing prices in the post-war period. However, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and with\ninflation in the medium term expected to remain below 2 percent, monetary and fiscal policies should\nbe focused on returning the economy to full employment.\nGiven what I have laid out today, let me close with this. We need to recognize the urgency of\nthe situation and the broader economic implications of housing’s continued struggles. All parties in\nthese markets should redouble their efforts, given the broader economic effects and their painful toll.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nNot to mention some European countries.\n\n2\n\nResidential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

This document, titled “Reforming\nAmerica’s Housing Finance Market: A Report to Congress,” is available at\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/Reforming%20America%27s%20Housing%20Finance%20Market.pdf.\n19\n\nThe GSEs regularly review delinquent loans to ensure that their loan files are consistent with the representations and\nwarranties made by originators. In cases where the GSEs believe the loan file does not match what the originator\npromised, the GSEs can issue a repurchase request. As delinquencies have risen, so have the number of these buyback\nrequests. Many have argued that concern over buybacks has made originators less willing to issue certain types of loans.\nOver the long run, economic theory would predict that market participants could work out a solution to this problem. For\nexample, third-party firms could arise to offer insurance to originators against buybacks. Alternatively, the originators and\nthe GSEs could find ways of doing business that would better capture the mutual gains from trade. But these market\nsolutions are less likely to come about if mortgage-market participants are uncertain about the future role of the GSEs.\n20\n\nAccording to the August 2011 Mortgage Monitor, published by Lender Processing Services, Inc., foreclosure timelines\nhave lengthened significantly during the past three years. In July 2011, the average mortgage in foreclosure was\ndelinquent for 599 days, up from 319 days in January 2009 [The LPS Mortgage Monitor, published by LPS Applied\nAnalytics, is available at\nhttp://www.lpsvcs.com/LPSCorporateInformation/ResourceCenter/PressResources/Pages/MortgageMonitor.aspx. The\nAugust 2011 Monitor includes data through the end of July. The days-delinquent statistic quoted in the text appears on\nslide 3.]. Also, foreclosure delays tend to be especially serious in states that require judicial involvement.\n21\n\nA report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which funds HAFA) reports that far\nmore short sales and deeds-in-lieu have taken place outside of HAFA than in it. See p. 67 of the SIGTARP’s July 2011\nQuarterly Report to Congress, available at\nhttp://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2011/July2011_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf.\nThis report states: “As of June 30, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data available, approximately $37.9\nmillion from TARP had been paid to investors, borrowers, and servicers in connection with 10,280 short sales or deeds-inlieu of foreclosure transfers completed under HAFA. As of May 31, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data\navailable, Treasury reported that the 10 largest servicers alone had completed 112,525 short sales and deeds-in-lieu\noutside HAMP for borrowers whose HAMP trial modifications had failed, borrowers who had chosen not to participate, or\nwere ineligible for the program.” The most recent data on the number of HAFA transactions is available from the U.S.\nTreasury at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx. While\ndocumentation requirements and other regulations in HAFA may be responsible for much of this difference, the Special\nInspector General’s report suggests that the difference could result in part by the ability of servicers to collect fees and\ndeficiency judgments for non-HAFA transactions. Deficiency judgments are not permitted in the HAFA program.\nNotably, many HAFA requirements have recently been relaxed. For example, as of February 1, servicers of non-GSE\nmortgages participating in HAFA are no longer required to verify a borrower’s financial information, or to determine that\nhis monthly mortgage payment exceeded 31 percent of his monthly income. However, servicers must continue to obtain a\nsigned affidavit indicating that the borrower has experienced some sort of financial hardship. See page 2 of the Making\nHome Affordable Program’s Supplemental Directive 10-18\n(https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/programs/docs/hafa/sd1018.pdf).\n22\n\nBorrowers currently have few incentives to speed the transfer of ownership.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nClark University\nWorcester, Massachusetts\nJuly 13, 2011\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today in Worcester as we discuss the opportunities and\nchallenges facing New England’s smaller industrial cities.1 At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,\nwe are very pleased to be collaborating with our co-sponsors in organizing this forum –\nthe Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, MassINC, and the Rappaport Institute for Greater\nBoston.\nI would like to briefly frame the economic context that prevails as we gather today. I think the\neconomic backdrop only underscores the importance of a practical and constructive forum like this\none, and the need for collaboration and leadership – which are themes of particular focus at this event.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nThe deep recession and slow recovery have had a significant impact on New England’s cities.\nAt the same time, we should note that our experience of late in New England has been less severe\nthan that of the nation. The unemployment rate for New England in May, the latest month we have a\nregional number for, was 7.9 percent – high, but well below the 9.1 percent rate for the nation as a\nwhole in May (a number that climbed to 9.2 percent in June). Many of our cities, particularly in the\nnorthern half of New England, have unemployment rates well below the national average. Also,\nmany cities in New England did not experience the extremes of boom and bust in residential real\nestate that plagued some cities elsewhere in the country.\nAs the economy continues its slow recovery, there are significant opportunities but also\ndaunting challenges facing our cities. But before discussing those opportunities and challenges, I\nwould like to briefly describe the national economic outlook.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\n\nAs we consider the national outlook, I would note that some have referred to the first half of\nthis year as a “slow patch” in the recovery. I am not sure that phrase is quite right, however – the\nnotion of a slow patch suggests strong growth that has been temporarily interrupted by some sort of\nheadwind or shock, like natural disasters or extreme weather that crimps economic activity. I would\ninstead describe the past two years as a consistently weak recovery, interrupted by a period of\nstronger growth. Let me add that a weak recovery like we have seen is, unfortunately, typical of\nrecoveries after a financial crisis.2\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 1 shows growth in what we call real final sales, which represents the goods and\nservices produced in the economy, not including inventories. If one assumes that the economy needs\nto grow faster than 2.5 percent – an estimate of what economists call its potential – to yield much\nimprovement in the unemployment rate, you see that we have had only one strong quarter in this\nrecovery (the fourth quarter of 2010).\nAlso, Figure 2 shows that consumers have been particularly tentative during the recovery.\nThe only quarter in which we saw consumption growth in excess of 2.5 percent during this recovery\nwas that same fourth quarter of 2010.\nIn short, the only quarter of strong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one\ncontaining the holiday season at the end of last year. With housing activity and government spending\nlikely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business\nconfidence improve so that consumption and investment can offset the weaker growth in other\ncomponents of gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe first half of this year saw the economic recovery impacted by the tragic destruction in\nJapan, which disrupted manufacturing supply chains, as well as weather issues ranging from severe\nwinter conditions to damaging floods. The result is that growth in the first half of this year is likely to\nbe roughly 2 percent.\nAs the effects of these problems fade, we do expect a rebound in purchases of consumer\ndurables to yield stronger growth in the third quarter. I expect economic growth over the second half\nof this year to average somewhere in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent. While this represents an\nimprovement from the first half, it is still quite slow given the amount of slack in the economy, and\nslower than I had expected at the beginning of this year.\nWhile we are seeing some positive economic signs such as equipment and software spending,\nand growth in exports, the employment report issued last Friday was dismal. The national\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nunemployment rate rose slightly (a tenth of a percent) to 9.2 percent in June. And net job growth was\nvery weak over the last two months – job growth averaged only 21,500 over the two-month period of\nMay and June.3 The employment-to-population ratio fell to 58.2 percent, matching the 28 year low\nthat we have hit a few times in this recovery.4\nNot surprisingly, with so much painful slack in the labor market we are not seeing any\nsignificant wage pressure – average hourly earnings fell slightly this month and have increased only\n1.9 percent over the past year – which is consistent with a continued low inflation rate in the medium\nterm. As Figures 3 highlights, wages are not likely to place much upward pressure on inflation since\ncompensation is growing only slowly, given weak job markets. In addition, Figure 4 shows that\nmany commodity prices have stabilized or retreated from their recent highs. These factors give\nmonetary policy the leeway to remain accommodative, so as to provide the monetary conditions for\nimproved economic growth.\nIn addition, there are significant downside risks associated with an outlook that includes only\nvery slow improvement in the economy. The headlines from Europe continue to remind us of this.\nWith fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here and abroad, it will in my view be important\nto maintain sufficiently accommodative U.S. monetary policy so that national labor market conditions\ncan improve.\n\nOpportunities and Challenges for New England’s Mid-Sized Cities\n\nSo the national outlook is for a continued slow recovery, which of course factors into the\nopportunities and challenges for New England’s mid-sized cities we have come together to discuss\ntoday.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nAlso, with widespread pressure for fiscal austerity not only impacting Federal budgets but also\nbudgets at the state and local level, I think we should acknowledge the acute challenges that cities\nface in prioritizing expenditures to ensure that program cuts do not impair the ability of their\ncommunities to prosper over the long term.\nAs we think about their opportunities and challenges, I think it is useful to highlight some of\nthe trends in New England’s mid-sized cities relative to New England as a whole, and the nation. For\nexample, Figure 5 highlights the differences in the populations of our mid-sized cities and the rest of\nthe region and the country with respect to age, at roughly decade intervals. The most recent data\nsuggest that New England as a whole now has a greater portion of people over 65 and a smaller\nportion of people under 15, and age 15 to 24, than the U.S. However, the residents of the region’s\nsmall and mid-sized cities are on average younger than the rest of New England – with a smaller share\nof people over 65 and a larger share of people 15 to 24 than both the region and the nation. As for the\nportion of people under 15, these cities exceed the region and are basically on par with the nation.\nIn exploring these trends and characteristics, I would like to offer a few possibilities – in the\ninterest of generating discussion today.\nFirst, it may be that younger workers “just starting out” are especially receptive to training for\njobs in a growing sector. So this younger profile of our mid-sized cities, and the fact that they are\noften the site of medical facilities serving the surrounding communities, together highlight a potential\nopportunity. Many of the mid-sized cities may be able to build on their medical-services base. While\nmedical employers require highly skilled doctors and nurses, they also hire a variety of other\nemployees in positions that often require only an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Indeed, our\nanalysis suggests that the number of jobs in the healthcare industry as a percent of total jobs is much\nhigher for these mid-sized New England cities than it is for the region as a whole, or for the nation.5\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nWorcester is a particularly good example of this, being home to hospitals, the University of\nMassachusetts medical school, and medical research firms. Other cities in the region have major\nmedical facilities with spillover benefits to the broader community, including Providence (with\nBrown medical school and partner hospitals), New Haven (with Yale school of medicine and YaleNew Haven Hospital), greater Hartford (with the University of Connecticut Health Center in the\nHartford suburb of Farmington), and Springfield (with Baystate Medical Center).\nTurning to educational characteristics in these cities, Figure 6 shows the percent of the\npopulation with a bachelor’s degree or higher, and with some college education or an associate’s\ndegree – again at roughly decade intervals. New England has a much higher percentage of college\ngraduates than the nation as a whole, but a smaller percentage of people with some college education\nor an associate’s degree. In contrast, the mid-sized cities have a smaller percentage than New\nEngland or the U.S of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher, or some college education or an\nassociate’s degree. The trend is up in these cities, however, over time.\nThis is particularly significant when we note that the unemployment experience over the past\ndecade has been quite different when segmented by educational attainment, as shown in Figure 7.\nThis is particularly true over the past several years, when the unemployment rates by educational\nattainment have widened significantly from where they were 10 years ago.\nAll this may suggest that community colleges can and should play a larger role in many of our\nmid-sized cities. Community colleges in New England have played less of a role in workforce\ndevelopment than in some parts of the country, where there is a very close connection between\nemployers (and potential employers) and the curricula developed and offered at community colleges.\nAs we think about future developments in our mid-sized cities, it is important that leaders at\ncommunity colleges and local business leaders work together in the ongoing development of\nspecialized curricula that will meet the evolving needs of local employers.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 8 shows that mid-sized cities in New England are increasingly diverse. Mid-sized\nNew England cities have a much higher proportion of individuals who were born outside of the U.S.\nthan the rest of New England or the country, and this has intensified over recent decades. These cities\nalso have a much higher percentage of individuals who are not proficient English speakers. This\nhighlights a potential impediment to getting higher education or some jobs.\nThe availability of English classes remains extremely important, and increasingly so. The\nsame is true for providing greater access to government programs for those with limited English. For\nexample, a working paper by the Bank’s Ana Patricia Muñoz shows that small business\nentrepreneurship programs often do not target Latino populations.6 State and Federal programs\ndesigned to help fund or provide technical assistance to small businesses may need to increasingly\ntailor some of their programs to fit the needs of local populations.\nHowever, despite these challenges I believe that the diversity in our mid-sized cities can also\nbe a decided advantage. Let me show another chart, Figure 9, which instead of foreign born and\nlimited English speakers simply indicates the portion of the population that is Hispanic, and the\nportion that is African American. You see again that while New England as a whole may be less\ndiverse than the rest of the nation, our mid-sized cities are more diverse -- and increasingly so over\nthe decades. Finding ways for businesses to reach diverse populations is likely to become\nincreasingly important as the country as a whole becomes more diverse, and as technology allows\neven small companies to reach markets in other countries. A product or service developed by or for a\ndiverse population in Worcester or Hartford or another mid-sized city may be a first step toward\naccessing diverse markets in the U.S., or even globally.\nMoreover, developing successful entrepreneurs within a diverse population could of course be\na source of local economic development. The Muñoz paper finds Latino businesses starting up in\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nmany of New England’s mid-sized cities, and this can be a source of future job growth if some of\nthese businesses can grow.\nFinally and importantly, I would observe that while New England has fared better than the rest\nof the country during the recession and the early stages of the recovery, the same is not true for our\nmid-sized cities, as shown in Figure 10. Unemployment rates are much higher in the mid-sized cities\nthan they are in New England or the country as a whole, in contrast to 10 years ago when the\nunemployment rates in the region’s mid-sized cities were below the national average.\n\nConcluding Observations\n\nIn summary and conclusion, our mid-sized cities are on average younger, proportionally less\nadvanced in education, and more diverse than the rest of New England. This provides both\nopportunities and challenges, as I have noted.\nAs many of these cities are regional centers, further developing their activities as medical and\neducational centers will be important, particularly given their younger population compared to New\nEngland as a whole.\nA theme for this conference is the need to build collaborative leadership. Leaders in\ngovernment will need to work collaboratively with leaders in education, the sciences, and businesses\nmore generally, and find ways to take advantage of some of the differences we see in our mid-sized\ncities.\nI think we all know this, and the challenge is in finding the best ways to do so, to everyone’s\nbenefit. It is our hope that this forum will be one avenue for supporting and advancing that\ncollaboration.\nThank you.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nWe define mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000, excluding\n“suburb cities” within 20 miles of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New Haven, CT;\nNorwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA; Lowell, MA; Lynn, MA;\nNew Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worcester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua, NH; Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and\nWarwick, RI.\n2\n\nAs I have discussed in other forums, the following dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are\naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower recoveries. Banks\nexperiencing large losses are often reluctant to raise additional capital – either because it could signal financial problems\nor be perceived as an attempt to avoid diluting existing shareholders. Instead, firms that choose not to raise additional\ncapital often satisfy capital-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets, and more importantly for the real economy,\nreducing their willingness to lend (loans are assets on a bank’s balance sheet). If this behavior is widespread, it can\nsignificantly reduce credit intermediation. Earlier in my career I studied this dynamic with my colleague Joe Peek, and\nour research found such behavior during the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession and during\nthe Japanese banking crisis.\nSee the following from Peek and Rosengren: “The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of\nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638. “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch,” in the\nJournal of Banking & Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692. \"The International Transmission of\nFinancial Shocks: The Case of Japan\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.\n\"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic\nReview, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45. \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of\nCredit in Japan\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166.\n3\n\nAbout 18,000 jobs were added in June and the May figure was revised to 25,000. The percent change over the two\nmonths is 0.03%. Employment rose by an average of 215,000 jobs per month from February through April but now has\naveraged 21,500 jobs over the past two months.\n4\n\nThe employment-to-population ratio hit 58.2 percent in Dec. 2009, Nov. 2010, and June 2011. It was 58.1 percent in\nJuly of 1983.\n5\n\nUsing data from the Economic Census, the figure for health care employment in mid-sized cities is almost 30 percent\n– twice as large a proportion as for the U.S. or New England – but it should be noted that the figures are calculated as a\npercent of total jobs that are available in the Economic Census, which excludes several job-heavy sectors (like elementary\nand secondary schools, colleges and universities, public administration and employees in most government owned\nestablishments like public utilities). Using different data sources that include many of these sectors suggests health care is\nover 22 percent of jobs in mid-sized Massachusetts cities, just under 15 percent in New England, and around 12 percent in\nthe U.S. Either approach suggests that health care is a very important sector for jobs, in absolute terms and compared to\nthe U.S. and rest of New England.\n6\n\nAna Patricia Muñoz, \"Small Businesses in Springfield, Massachusetts: A Look at Latino Entrepreneurship\", a Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston Community Development Discussion paper with Lynn Browne, Sol Carbonell, Prabal\nChakrabarti, DeAnna Green, Yolanda K.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nA Look Inside\na Key Economic Debate:\nHow Should Monetary Policy Respond\nto Price Increases Driven by\nSupply Shocks?\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the Massachusetts Chapter of\nNAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate\nDevelopment Association\nMay 4, 2011\n\nI would like to thank David Begelfer and his colleagues at NAIOP Massachusetts for\ninviting me to join you today to discuss the economy and monetary policy.\nI am happy that financial markets and the economy have made significant progress since\nthe depths of the financial crisis, but I am far less happy that the recovery to date has been so\nundesirably slow and anemic. In my reading of economic history this is, unfortunately, typical\nof economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial disruptions.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe debate I’d like to focus on today is the one over the likely impact of recent increases\nin the prices of food and energy, and how monetary policy should respond.* The Fed’s policy\nstance, as you know, is currently very accommodative – a stance that I believe is appropriate\ngiven the tentative recovery and still-high unemployment. But with food and energy prices\nrising, some observers think the Fed should shift its stance to less accommodation – slowing\neconomic growth now to ensure we don’t have undesirably high inflation in the future – even\nthough current measures of core inflation (that is, inflation omitting volatile food and energy\nprices) remain low by historical standards.\nAs the recovery continues – albeit slowly – several events have occurred that further\ncomplicate the outlook for inflation and real economic activity. Political upheaval in the Middle\nEast has contributed to sharply higher oil prices. Severe weather has reduced harvests from\nRussia to Australia, causing higher prices for many agricultural products. And Japan’s tragic\nearthquake and tsunami caused not only terrible loss of life, but also disruption to a supply chain\nthat is increasingly global.\nSo today I would like to discuss how monetary policy should react when the economy is\nbuffeted by a series of these so-called “supply shocks.” I’d like to just highlight my major points\nbefore getting into the data and analysis that underpin my perspective.\nFirst, I want to explain that while I will be making distinctions in this talk between socalled “core” and overall or total measures of inflation, we at the Federal Reserve look at all\nprices, including food and energy prices, when developing U.S. monetary policy. While we\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\noften use core measures as a guide to where overall inflation is most likely to go, our goal is to\nstabilize overall inflation.\nAllow me to preview one of my conclusions. Because my analysis suggests that recent\nfood and oil price increases have their roots in concerns about wheat harvests in Russia and oil\nproduction in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to\nrespond to these disruptions. While many observers see food and energy prices rising and\nassume the Fed should tighten policy – raise the cost of money and credit – to head off inflation,\nI would suggest taking a step back and recognizing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do\nnothing to stabilize Libyan oil production, reduce uncertainty about political stability in the rest\nof the Middle East, or increase the wheat harvest in Russia.\nIn fact, tightening monetary policy solely in response to contractionary supply shocks\nwould likely make the impact of the shocks worse for households and businesses. To see why\nthis is so, it is important to keep in mind how supply shocks affect the economy.1\nFirst, supply shocks can lead to increases in food and energy prices that slow economic\ngrowth. For example, because a person’s need to drive may not be very flexible, spending on\ngas consumes a bigger portion of their budget. So an oil shock tends to force consumers to\nreduce their spending on other goods and services as they absorb higher oil costs.2\nSecond, while the prices of goods directly affected by the supply disruption increase,\nother prices in the marketplace may be unaffected – at least initially. If the supply shock\ninvolves food or energy, this dynamic causes measures of total inflation to rise, but does not\nhave a large impact on what economists call core inflation – which excludes the volatile food\nand energy sectors. But in the longer-run, the impact of the supply shock on the prices of other\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngoods will depend importantly on how inflation expectations respond to the shock. If people\nexpect that food and energy prices will stabilize – in other words, that the price shock will be\ntemporary – and do not believe that the central bank will allow any long-run effect on inflation,\nthen the disruption to total inflation will likely be temporary and the total inflation rate will\neventually converge with the lower core inflation rate. Since 1986, this has largely been what\nhappened when we experienced these types of supply shocks – as I’ll illustrate in a moment with\nsome charts.\nAlternatively, if expectations of inflation do rise in response to the supply shock, then\n(nominal) wages and salaries across the economy will be pressured to increase over time to keep\npace. If that happens, the supply shock could affect prices throughout the economy – not just\nthose that that were part of the initial supply shock. In this case, the core rate of inflation rises to\nconverge with the higher measure of total inflation. This was the U.S. experience in the 1970s,\nfor reasons I’ll discuss in a moment.\nWe at the Fed need to very closely monitor the data to make sure that inflation remains\ncontained. And we will. But as I believe I will demonstrate this morning, the most likely result\nis that these supply shocks cause slower growth in the near term while having only a modest\neffect on longer-term inflation rates – which has been the U.S. experience since 1986.\nUnemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 percent, and I anticipate a slower return to\nfull employment than we would have experienced absent these supply shocks. With the core\ninflation rate over the prior year at a little above 1 percent, I anticipate only a gradual return of\ncore and total inflation rates to something like our consensus “stable” rate of about 2 percent,\nover the medium term.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIf the economic data continue to support this outlook then the current, accommodative\nstance of monetary policy is appropriate, and can remain in place and continue to support\neconomic growth – so that we continue to make progress toward our goals of returning to full\nemployment and a sustainable long-run inflation rate – the two elements of the Federal Reserve’s\ndual mandate from Congress.\n\nThe Impact of Recent Supply Shocks\nNow that you know my basic take on this key – and current – economic debate, allow me\nto flesh out my perspective with the supporting data and analysis. The full impact of the recent\nshocks to supply that I mentioned at the outset will likely emerge over time. But clearly there\nhave been significant increases in a variety of food and energy prices. As Figure 1 illustrates,\nthe recent turmoil in the Middle East has contributed to a significant increase in oil prices, which\nhave risen to over $100 a barrel. This is well above the average of nearly $80 a barrel\nexperienced over 2010, but at the same time still well below the peak of $146 a barrel that\noccurred in mid July, 2008.\nThe recent volatility in oil prices, as the chart shows, is quite striking. Sharp increases\nhave been followed by sharp decreases. This is one reason we may not want to overreact to price\nchanges – they could be transitory.\nFigure 2 shows the movements in oil prices – their percent change from a year earlier, in\nthe top line – relative to the change in compensation (the lower line), since 2000. Oil prices have\nrisen recently, but based on the history captured in this chart, one would not expect much of a\nresponse in wages and salaries. This, of course, is one reason why consumers feel worse off\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nafter an oil supply shock. Prices at gas stations in Massachusetts are now around $4.00 a gallon,\nyet most people’s need to drive cars has not changed much if at all. So income available for\nbuying other goods and services has been squeezed by the increase in oil prices.3\nSome softness in measures of consumer confidence suggests that consumers tend to be\nless confident about the future when oil prices rise. If consumers pull back spending as a result\nof a supply shock, it has the potential to be a drag on the economy. The Boston Fed’s statistical\nmodeling suggests that a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil will shave roughly four-tenths\nof a percentage point off the rate of economic growth over two years, and cause the\nunemployment rate to be roughly two-tenths of a percentage point higher than it would be absent\nthe oil shock. While this is certainly not enough to completely stop the recovery, it does imply a\nslowing down of its pace.\nOil is not the only commodity to experience price increases of late. A variety of\nagricultural prices have also increased. For example, Figure 3 shows the movement of wheat\nprices over the last decade. Droughts in Russia, flooding in Australia, and increased demand in\nemerging markets have all placed upward pressure on wheat prices.\nAs with oil prices, higher food prices appear to be responding to supply and demand\nfeatures of this market – and these types of price changes cannot be offset by monetary policy. It\ngoes without saying that monetary policy cannot alter the supply of oil from volatile parts of the\nworld, nor weather conditions in countries that are major exporters of agricultural products.\nMonetary policy can have a role in insuring that relative price changes do not alter inflation\nexpectations. Rising inflation expectations could make it difficult to achieve a moderate and\nacceptable inflation rate over the medium term.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHistorical Experience with Supply Shocks\nSupply shocks are not unique to this period. However, the evidence shows that the\neconomic impact of supply shocks on inflation has changed over time – actually quite\ndramatically. Figure 4 shows the inflation rate (total inflation and core, which again excludes\nfood and energy) since 1970. What is striking is the way the behavior of the two series differed\nin the 1970 to 1985 period versus the period from 1986 to the present. The interplay of core and\ntotal inflation is very, very different in the more recent period than it was in the former.\nI realize that delving into topics like total and core inflation can seem a bit abstract. So\nlet me bring in something a bit straightforward – energy prices and inflation. Figure 5 shows the\nprofound effect that energy prices had in the 1970s on core inflation. In the 1970s the lines\nmove up and down together as core inflation increased with energy prices. That is why my\nearlier chart shows core and total inflation moving so closely in that era. But since 1986,\ndramatic movements in energy prices have not affected core prices.\nMy next two figures look at each period separately. Figure 6 shows that for much of that\nearlier period, inflation rates were much higher than they are currently. From 1970 to 1985,\ninflation was quite volatile – with total inflation (measured by the all-items Consumer Price\nIndex or CPI) peaking at almost 15 percent, in 1980. The key observation is that during this\nperiod, increases in core inflation tended to follow increases in total inflation (which includes\nfood and energy). The oil and food price increases “pulled” core inflation.\nIn contrast, Figure 7 shows the total and core inflation rates since 1986. During this\nperiod, inflation has been lower and less volatile. And unlike in the earlier period, core inflation\ndoes not follow or gravitate to the level of total inflation. Total inflation jumps up and down as\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfood and energy prices live up to their reputation for volatility. The spikes are tough on\nhouseholds, to be sure. But importantly, total inflation eventually gravitates to the core measure\nthat excludes food and energy. Core inflation stays “moored.”\nFigure 8 represents another way to use the available data to explore this relationship. It\ntoo shows that the increases in total inflation in recent years have generally been temporary. For\neach quarter from 1998 to 2010, the figure plots the difference between total inflation and core\ninflation at the time, and the total inflation rate two years later. What it shows is that when there\nis a supply shock such that total inflation (including food and energy) exceeds core inflation, two\nyears later total inflation tends to be lower – when supply shocks such as oil prices drive up total\ninflation relative to core, the total tends to come back down toward the core inflation rate.\nFigure 9 performs similar analysis but focuses on the future core inflation rate, instead of\nthe total. It shows no strong relationship. When total and core inflation diverge, core inflation\ntends to stay put. In other words, in recent years, when something like an oil shock causes total\ninflation to diverge from core, there was no consistent implication for the future core inflation\nrate. The shock to total inflation did not become embedded in core inflation.\nWhy is all this important? If supply shocks tend to have a transitory impact on headline\ninflation, and do not pass through to any meaningful extent into core inflation, then monetary\npolicy need not respond to the price increases caused by the supply shock. Currently, we have\nexperienced sharply higher food and energy prices. If the relationship we document over the last\n13 years continues, we should expect the impact on inflation to be transitory – and that total\ninflation will converge back to core inflation, which remains well below 2 percent.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nTo digress, it is likely the case that supply shocks have become transitory because of the\nway in which monetary policy has tended to respond. So, as long as monetary policy behaves\nabout as it has in recent years, then there is no reason to expect supply shocks to have lasting\neffects.\nSo is Fed policy behaving as it has since the mid 1980s? Interestingly, although Fed\npolicy is perceived as exceptionally accommodative, because of hitting the zero lower bound the\nfederal funds rate is actually higher – has come down less – than would be expected if the Fed\nbehaved as it has over the last 25 years. The current level of the funds rate suggest that we have\nbeen less accommodative in recent years given that interest-rate reductions (policy easing) ran\ninto at the zero lower bound.4\n\nWhy the Different Reaction to Supply Shocks Over Time?\nBut how confident should we be that the relationship we have experienced over the past\n25 years – little response in medium term inflation rates to supply shocks – will continue? The\nanswer is rooted in why we are seeing different reactions to supply shocks – in other words a\ndifferent interplay of total and core inflation – now versus in the past.\nThere are a variety of reasons why medium-term inflation has not been significantly\ninfluenced by short-run supply shocks in recent years. In my view the reasons include the\nincreased role of services in the economy, the importance of labor costs in such an economy, the\nreduced share of oil consumption relative to GDP, and as I mentioned earlier the improved\nconduct of monetary policy versus the 1960s and 1970s.5\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 10 shows that the service sector has grown from a little over 60 percent of private\nsector employment in 1970 to a little over 80 percent in 2010. As the economy has come to\nemphasize services versus manufacturing, it may be that commodities (and thus their prices)\nhave become somewhat less important to the production of goods and services. And goods\nprices are more volatile than services prices, and more likely to be priced like commodities.\nFigure 11 shows the per capita consumption of oil declining in the United States.\nConservation measures by consumers and businesses have made the economy less dependent on\noil than in the 1970s. While oil remains a very important commodity, the trend towards reducing\ndependence on oil provides greater insulation from oil-induced supply shocks.\nFigure 12 shows the U.S. share of world oil consumption (in blue) ticking down, but also\nclearly shows (in red) the steady climb in the share consumed by three of the so-called emergingmarket economies – China, India, and Brazil. Figure 13 shows the growth in oil consumption in\nthose three countries, in the upper three lines. Both charts depict quite strikingly the heightened\ndemand for oil emanating from emerging markets.\nReturning to the U.S. and inflation concerns, Figure 14 shows that the growth rate of\nemployee compensation has generally been declining over the past two decades. With\ncompensation slowing and productivity increasing, many firms have been profitable and able to\nwithstand increases in commodity prices without passing such costs on to final prices. This fits\nwith the observation that higher food and energy prices have not tended to have much of an\nimpact on prices in situations where food and energy are not direct costs of doing business.\nFigure 15 shows two measures of inflation expectations, plotted alongside oil price\nmovements. The red line shows what professional forecasters expected inflation to average over\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe next 10 years, at various points in time. Their expectations have declined somewhat over the\npast 20 years, but what is striking is the relative stability of their inflation expectations. In\naddition, there was no significant reaction to the oil price shock that we experienced in 2008.\nThe chart also shows a second measure of inflation expectations – the University of Michigan\nSurvey (the green line), which asks respondents about their expectations for inflation over the\nnext 5 to 10 years6. Again these expectations are not very responsive to movements in oil prices,\nand have remained quite stable over the past two decades.\nIt is worth noting that countries can be affected quite differently by supply shocks. As\nFigure 16 shows, the importance of food in the “basket” of goods purchased by consumers can\nvary greatly by country. In less developed countries, food is a very significant component of\noverall purchases by consumers. In a developed country such as the United States, food is a\nmuch smaller share of overall purchases. Thus the impact of a food-supply shock on the overall\ninflation rate and on other important economic variables such as wages and total imports can\nvary widely by country. Given the different impacts of supply shocks, it is not surprising that\nmonetary policy is likely to react differently to a supply shock such as food, depending on the\nunique characteristics of the particular country.\nFigure 17 shows that in the United States, the importance of food as a component of\ninflation measures has been declining over time. And, despite improvements in energy\nconservation that have lowered the per capita consumption of oil, higher energy prices have\ncontributed to recent increases in the importance of energy in the consumer price index. The fact\nthat food and energy prices have been quite volatile recently, but remain a relatively small part of\nthe entire basket of goods, helps to explain why core inflation rates have not been particularly\nresponsive to food and energy shocks.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I recognize that recent supply shocks have caused pressures on many\nhousehold budgets, and have led some analysts and observers to become concerned about\npotential long-term inflationary impacts. However, I think the evidence shows that over the past\n25 years most supply shocks have been transitory – and have had no long-lasting imprint on\nlonger term inflation, or on inflation expectations.\nNonetheless, recent historical trends do not always continue, so it is important to monitor\ninflation dynamics very closely to make sure that this pattern is continuing in the incoming data.\nIn particular, I will look intently at whether there is any evidence that the expectations of\nunderlying inflation have changed. To date, expectations seem quite stable and show no\nevidence of diverging from the recent past. I am committed to responding decisively, and as\nforcefully as necessary, to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain stable and that\nfood and energy price increases are not passing through to other prices.7\nGiven the important role of labor costs in a developed, services-focused economy such as\nthe United States, it is important to closely monitor trends in labor markets. Currently, wages\nand salaries are reflecting heightened unemployment, and show no evidence that potential\ninflation concerns are placing upward pressure on wages and salaries.\nCore inflation rates tend to be a reasonable predictor of inflation in the intermediate term.\nCore inflation remains well below my long-run target for inflation. This gives us flexibility to\nfocus on accommodative monetary policy doing what it can to promote more rapid growth in the\neconomy. As Figure 18 illustrates, the percent of the adult population that is employed now is\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nquite low in relation to recent history, and has shown only a slight improvement over the course\nof the recovery.\nSo with significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation expectations, and core inflation\nwell below our longer run target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down with\ntighter monetary policy. Until we make more progress on both elements of the Federal\nReserve’s mandate – employment and inflation – the current, accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy is appropriate.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nMy colleague Geoffrey Tootell, Director of Research at the Boston Fed, has prepared an illuminating public policy\nbrief that investigates whether commodity price spikes cause long-term inflation. The brief, which will be available\nat http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppb/2011/ppb111.htm, examines the relationship between trend inflation and\ncommodity price increases and finds that evidence from recent decades supports the notion that commodity price\nchanges do not affect the long-run inflation rate. Evidence from earlier decades suggests that effects on inflation\nexpectations and wages played a key role in whether commodity price movements altered trend inflation.\n2\n\nReaders may be interested in “Oil and the Macroeconomy in a Changing World,” the proceedings of a 2010\nsymposium held at the Boston Fed to explore the interactions between energy prices, growth, and inflation – the\ndeterminants of oil prices and about the effect that oil prices have on the world economy. The proceedings are\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/oil2010/index.htm\n\n3\n\nEven future purchases can be affected, if saving for them is squeezed.\n\n4\n\nThe Fed’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases have partly, but not completely, substituted for the constraint imposed by\nthe zero lower bound on policy easing. With all the excess capacity — a reflection of our inability to be as\naccommodative as we might have liked, given the zero bound — it seems unlikely that supply shocks will turn into\nincreased inflation expectations that will affect wages and non-oil, non-food prices.\n5\n\nVice Chair Yellen notes that “a key lesson from the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the stability of\nlonger-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. At that time, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy\nframework was opaque, its measures of resource utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a\nstop-start pattern that undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve's commitment to keep inflation under\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncontrol. Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and nominal wages and prices spiraled\nupward as workers sought compensation for past price increases and as firms responded to accelerating labor costs\nwith further increases in prices. That wage-price spiral was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under\nChairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s. Since then the Federal Reserve\nhas remained determined to avoid these mistakes and to keep inflation low and stable.”\n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20110411a.htm]\n6\n\nThe average annual expected price change they expect over the next 5 to 10 years\n\n7\n\nSee for example the comments on commodity price pressures and monetary policy by my colleague William\nDudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee:\n“Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term\ninflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.”\n[http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2011/dud110228.html]\n\n14\n\n\fHow Should Monetary Policy\nRespond to Price Increases\nDriven by Supply Shocks?\nEric S.

I’d like to thank Boston University and all the conference organizers,\nparticularly Larry Kotlikoff, for the opportunity to be here to discuss lessons learned from the\nglobal financial meltdown.*\nEveryone knows that the past three years have been a particularly difficult period for\nglobal financial market stability and for the global economy. The financial crisis clearly showed\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nthe dramatic impact that financial problems can have on the real economy. And in spite of a fair\namount of focus on financial stability prior to the crisis, events highlighted that the private and\npublic sectors both here and abroad were not fully prepared for the kinds of financial shocks we\nexperienced.\nToday I’d like to discuss the role of what I call “financial myths” in creating financial\ncrises. By financial myths I mean the beliefs, held by most market participants and by\nregulators, that certain outcomes are so unlikely to occur that they can basically be ignored –\nessentially that low probability events, based on historical experience, can be reclassified as zero\nprobability events. When these sorts of widespread assumptions – these financial myths – turn\nout to be wrong, most financial-market participants find themselves poorly positioned for the\nresulting shocks. The result is insolvency of groups of firms and substantial uncertainty –\nuncertainty about the exposure of many firms to direct losses, or to indirect losses created by\ntheir counterparty exposure to other firms that suffer direct losses.\nThese so-called financial myths are not unique to this time period, or to this country. I\nwould like to briefly mention two among the numerous examples from recent history – examples\nwhere financial myths were important in helping to create a potential crisis. The first example\ninvolves the assumption of many in Japan that real estate prices could not fall in the late 1980s.\nThe second involves the assumption, in the late 1990s, that the Internet had completely changed\nhow we should think about company valuation.\nI will then briefly mention four financial myths that played critical roles in the recent\nfinancial crisis. These include the following assumptions:\n•\n\nthat a diversified portfolio of US real estate had little risk of falling in value;\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n•\n\nthat Triple-A rated securities based on mortgages were so well protected by the\nstructure of the securitization that they posed little risk even if real estate prices did\nfall;\n\n•\n\nthat the evolution of many financial institutions to an “originate to distribute” model\nof lending and securitization meant there was little risk exposure to declining real\nestate prices; and,\n\n•\n\nthat there was little risk of a “run” on organizations like investment banks that relied\non short-term, collateralized borrowing.\n\nThen to conclude I’d like to briefly mention what we can and must do to reduce the risks\nresulting from these sorts of financial myths, going forward. I believe that financial stability\nwill, in the future, be better served as we implement some of the protections afforded by the\nDodd-Frank Act; but I also suspect that doing better at protecting against various financial myths\nultimately requires a cultural change. As a discipline, risk management has been too willing to\naccept that historical statistical relationships will be stable. Ideally, risk management practices\nwould lead us to ask things like “What will happen if the historical relationship breaks down?”\nand “What assumptions would need to change for them to break down?”\nAlso, I will touch on the fact that challenging assumptions and understanding the risk\ninherent in relying solely on historical experience should not be the responsibility of the risk\nmanager alone. These things also need to be better ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of\ndirectors, and regulators. I believe we need to do a much better job of using so-called stress tests\nto challenge commonly held views, so that boards of directors and regulators of firms better\nunderstand the fundamental drivers of risks in organizations and in the financial system.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinancial Myths in Recent History\nLet me look back to the time period before the most recent crisis and share two examples\nof financial myths – and, unfortunately, their messy demise. And I would emphasize that these\nare just two of many examples of the phenomenon.\nFirst, I’ll note that during the late 1980s, New England began to experience substantial\ndeclines in residential and commercial real estate prices. My research at that time at the Boston\nFed was focused on how problems at financial institutions could disrupt credit availability.\nInterestingly, in 1989 I was visited by a variety of Japanese academics and government officials.\nThey wanted to understand how we had missed the signs of an overheating real estate market.\nAs Figure 1 indicates, it was shall we say an interesting time for researchers from Japan\nto ask such a question. However, when I inquired about the rapid increase in real estate prices in\ntheir country, I always received the same answer – Japan is an island nation and had limited\nbuildable lots, and that prevented real estate prices from declining. This view was very widely\nheld. However, as you can see in Figure 2, that widely held financial myth was soon shattered.\nUnfortunately, the result of this belief was eventually the crippling of some of the world’s largest\nfinancial institutions, a long period of subpar economic growth in Japan, and eventually a\nproblematic deflation that Japan struggles with to this day.\nA second example is provided by the growth of the Internet, and in particular the growth\nin “dot-com” stock valuations, in the late 1990s. As Figure 3 shows, there was a substantial runup in stock valuations during this period. At the time I had conversations with a variety of\nfinancial professionals in Boston who made the argument that traditional valuation measures no\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nlonger applied. The view assumed by many was that valuation of firms should be based on\nclicks of a computer mouse rather than earnings, either current or expected in the future.\nAs Figure 4 shows, such enthusiasm for a new way of valuing companies was shortlived. But importantly, the substantial decline in Internet-related stocks did not create a financial\ncrisis. Many of the positions were equity financed – so, while significant wealth was lost,\nfinancial institutions and financial markets did not suffer severe repercussions. That loss in\nwealth helped ignite the 2001 recession, but it was a much more mild downturn than the one we\nhave experienced of late. With the financial infrastructure not significantly damaged, the impact\nwas much less severe than if individuals and firms had taken highly leveraged positions.\n\nFinancial Myths in the Recent Crisis\nNow I’d like to describe, and present some charts that illustrate, four financial myths that\nplayed a role in the recent crisis.\n\nMyth 1 – Diversification eliminated the risk of declines in residential real estate holdings\nDespite the experience of Japan’s real estate in the 1990s, and substantial declines in real\nestate prices in many regions of the United States throughout history, many commentators argued\nthat a significant, widespread housing-price decline in a country as large and varied as the United\nStates had not happened historically and was very unlikely to occur.\nThat logic was based on what you see in Figure 5, which highlights that there had been\nsignificant declines in some regions of the country – but the declines were coincident with\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nincreases elsewhere. As Figure 6 shows, there had not been recent, sustained declines in\nnational real estate prices. This observation, combined with the increased securitization of real\nestate into diversified national portfolios, gave buyers – and those rating the securitizations –\nconfidence that the “real estate cycle risk” was substantially mitigated through diversification.\nBut, as Figure 7 shows, the assumption that a geographically diversified portfolio of real\nestate assets would avoid price declines proved wrong. While prices nationally had not\nexperienced a substantial decline in the past, for three years the U.S. has experienced substantial\nand sustained declines in prices.\nSome of my colleagues point out, probably appropriately, that given the historical data\nthe failure to anticipate nationwide house prices falling is largely understandable. It was\ncertainly very widespread. What may be more surprising is that in the 2005 timeframe, when\nmany were expecting house prices to slow down or flatten, there was not much by way of risk\nmitigation undertaken.\n\nMyth 2 – Triple-A mortgage securities carried little risk\nThe securitization market – that is, the market for securities based on various slices of\npooled mortgages – grew dramatically over the past decade. One reason for the growth in\nsecuritization was investor interest in, and demand for, securities with little credit risk but returns\nabove those of Treasuries.\nMany buyers of such securities felt sure of two things. First, that national real estate\nprices were quite unlikely to fall – in other words, our Myth 1. Second, that even in the highly\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunlikely event that the price of a national portfolio did fall, they would be protected by the\nstructure of the securitization. Securitizations were structured so that any losses were first borne\nby lower-rated securities built from the pool of underlying mortgages. Given the structure, the\nassumption was that lower-valued securities would take all potential losses if borrowers\ndefaulted. Many – but not all, of course1 -- assumed that home-price declines and related\ndefaults would have to be very extreme before the highest rated, Triple-A securities were\nimpacted. Under this assumption these securities fully deserved the Triple-A rating given by the\nrating agencies.\nI should note that making this assumption about Triple-A rated mortgage backed\nsecurities (MBSs) proved less problematic than making this assumption about the recombined\nlower tranches of mortgage-backed securities that were billed as Triple-A rated collateralized\ndebt obligations (CDOs). 2 But many investors focused not on the security’s underlying\ncomponents, merely on the ratings.\nFigure 8 shows that Triple-A securities remained at par values as the securitization boom\ngathered steam. However, Figure 9 shows that when the severity of the decline in house prices\nmanifested itself, even the Triple-A rated mortgage securities collapsed in value. The\ncombination of illiquidity, growing concerns with the real estate market, and ebbing confidence\nin the ratings resulted in dramatic declines in the pricing of Triple-A securities as the financial\ncrisis worsened.3\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMyth 3 - The “originate to distribute” model limited the balance-sheet risk of banks\nOver the decade preceding the crisis, large commercial and investment banks had become\nincreasingly involved in securitizing mortgage assets. They argued that this provided a steady\nstream of fee income but generated little risk for the bank. While they packaged mortgages, they\nwere not retaining the risk in their own portfolio – instead, the risk was taken by those that\npurchased the mortgage securities, particularly the lower-rated mortgage securities.\nWhat was frequently ignored by many was the rapid growth of Triple-A mortgage\nsecurities holdings elsewhere within the banks, as well as in off balance sheet structures. While\nthese off balance sheet structures were considered separate entities, banks found the potential\nreputational risk of not supporting their sponsored off balance sheet risk sufficiently great that\nmany ended up supporting these off balance sheet structures. In a sense, “originate to distribute”\nwas, in practice, something more like “originate to hold, loosely, somewhat off to the side.4”\nIn addition, risk managers, bank management, and regulators were sufficiently lulled by\nMyths 1 and 2 to develop their faith in Myth 3. The unfortunate result was that these banks were\nnot as protected from falling housing prices as many had assumed, and this contributed to the\nsubstantial decline in stock prices and the need for government support for many of these large\nfinancial intermediaries.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMyth 4 – Investment banks were not subject to runs, because their liabilities were\ncollateralized\nThere has long been an understanding, and indeed a regulatory presumption, that banks\ncould be subject to “runs,” resulting in a need for both deposit insurance and a heavily regulated\nenvironment to reduce that risk. At the same time, it had largely been presumed that investment\nbanks were better protected against such runs. While the balance sheets of investment banks had\nsubstantial short-term liabilities, many of them were collateralized. Investment banks would buy\nlonger-term securities but finance them with short-term borrowing (using repurchase\nagreements). It was assumed that because there was collateral backing up the loans, borrowers\nwere protected and would not run.\nFinancing securities with short-term borrowing allowed investment banks to substantially\nexpand their balance sheets, as shown in Figure 10. However, the lenders in this market were\nother banks, money-market funds, and hedge funds. As questions about the value of the\ncollateral became more prominent, and the solvency and liquidity of investment banks became a\ngreater concern, many short-term lenders abandoned the market. Figure 11 shows the dramatic\nchange that occurred. The inability to finance large securities holdings made the traditional\nmodel of investment banking unsustainable, and this contributed to the failure of investment\nbanks and the merger under duress, or conversion to bank holding companies, of others.\n\nWhat Can We Do about Financial Myths, Going Forward?\nWe plumb this history to help us understand what we can do about financial myths, going\nforward, and how we can avoid their damaging impact.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAs the previous slides have shown, taking too much confidence in historical data\nrepeating in the future can be dangerous – to the financial health of institutions and the financial\nsystem. That said, we are probably not likely to see a sea-change in the tendency for\noverconfidence in and reliance on recent statistical regularities.\nHowever, there are a variety of market participants that could better protect their own\ninterests – and the financial system – if they spend more time understanding the key assumptions\nbeing made in financial modeling, and have a clearer understanding of what could happen if\nthose assumptions were invalid. Properly done, stress testing should provide valuable\ninformation to organizations on key risk drivers. This needs to be more than feeding a handful of\nmacroeconomic assumptions into a model. It requires an understanding of the events that could\nlead to that macroeconomic outcome, and what other indirect effects might be likely to occur.\nWho should be responsible for regular, thoughtful stress testing? Risk managers, CEOs,\nand boards of directors should all understand key risk drivers – and should consider whether a\nstress scenario is sufficiently severe, and whether the direct and indirect effects are reasonably\ncaptured. Rating agencies and stock analysts should be increasingly demanding better quality\nstress tests, and that the results be made available to them. Finally, regulators should be able to\ncompare and contrast the quality of stress tests across organizations and hold accountable those\norganizations that are not keeping up with their peers.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, challenging assumptions and understanding risks should not\nonly be the responsibility of the risk manager. These things also need to be better ingrained in\nCEOs, members of boards of directors, and regulators.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nOperationalizing this point is not going to be easy, but it is critical. At a fundamental\nlevel, debunking a myth requires individuals to go against strongly and widely held beliefs, to\nconvince decision-makers, and to build consensus. For this to happen we may need significant\nchanges in the governance of risk management at banks and other parties in the financial system.\nPut more plainly, we need to think about an environment where those in the position of most\ninfluence have the incentive to “poke holes” in myths via robust stress tests, and not the\nincentives to override their risk managers when the stress-test implications are not to their liking,\nor risk a near-term loss of clients or market share.\n\nConcluding Observations\nNew financial myths are regularly created. In closing, I will just speculate on where\nsome may exist that interested parties should be exploring, now.\n\n•\n\nPotential Myth 1 – Sovereign debt problems will not be disruptive to the world\neconomy. Not long ago, the sovereign debt problems were viewed as manageable\nand confined to one country. However, as interest rate spreads have widened – as\nshown in Figure 12 – investors are highlighting that problems in many countries have\nyet to be resolved. While I believe the most likely outcome is that there are no\nserious disruptions, interested parties should diligently consider scenarios that could\nbe disruptive, involving various countries.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n•\n\nPotential Myth 2 – State and local financing problems will not be disruptive to the national\neconomy.\n\nWhile much attention has been given to problems in state and local\n\nfinances, it is generally assumed that the capacity exists to resolve these problems.\nWhile I expect these issues will be resolved without widespread or cascading\nproblems, we should consider what scenarios could emerge if political impasses result\nin more disruptive outcomes.\n\nThese are just two of many potential scenarios that are worth exploring. However, I\nwould add that the recent financial crisis highlighted that unlikely events can happen, and when\nthey do, the outcomes can be quite costly for everyone. So the need for better risk management\nis clear. Fortunately, the opportunity is there as well.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nBoston Fed researchers note some examples of contrary analysis of Subprime ABS structures written in\n2005 suggesting vulnerability to even a 5 percent fall in house prices.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJanuary 14, 2011\nRemarks at the New England Mortgage Expo,\nhosted by the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation and The Warren Group\n\nI’d like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak with you today. The\nbeginning of a new year is a good time to discuss the outlook for the economy. I will also try to\nanswer a couple of the key questions that most everyone seems to be asking about, in relation to\nthis recovery.*\nAs I’m sure you know, over the past several weeks we have been getting economic data\nconsistent with a somewhat happier new year. A recovery that has been anemic for the past year\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nand a half looks to be increasingly supported by private spending as 2011 begins. The Blue Chip\nforecast for 2011 has increased 4 tenths over the previous month, to 3.3 percent.\nAnd I am slightly more optimistic than the Blue Chip; my own forecast is for growth of\n3.5 to 4.0 percent over 2011. This is certainly an improvement, but – soberingly – would still\nleave the unemployment rate close to 9 percent at the end of this year, a rate far above anyone’s\nestimate of full employment.\nGiven the evidence of substantial excess capacity and a quite low core inflation rate, it is\nabsolutely appropriate that monetary policy – and indeed fiscal policy – have been deployed in a\nway that encourages a more robust recovery. Going forward, it is my view that monetary policy\nmust continue to focus on addressing both elements of the Fed’s mandate – price stability, and\ngrowth supporting a return to full employment in the medium term.\nToday I am going to focus on two questions that seem to be at the forefront of most\ndiscussions of the recovery.\nThe first question is, what role will housing play in the recovery? As the most interestsensitive component of gross domestic product (GDP), housing has traditionally been an\nimportant sector of the economy for generating recovery. I will be highlighting the fact that,\ndespite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing recovery, I expect housing will\nnot provide as much support to this recovery as it has in previous ones. My sense is that\nresidential investment, consumer durables, and services related to housing will be less robust\nthan is usual in many recoveries, thus playing a role in what I think will be only a gradual\nimprovement in the economy and employment.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nTo put it plainly, these housing-related headwinds are part of why I do not expect growth\ngreater than 4 percent this year. And while 4 percent is not terrible, at that rate it will still take a\nvery long time to get back to full employment.\nThe second key question is, how concerned should we all be about a flare-up in inflation\n– and aren’t the measures the Fed has taken inflationary? Many have expressed concern that\nFederal Reserve policy actions that expanded our balance sheet dramatically will cause inflation.\nI firmly believe that in the short run inflation is likely to remain quite low – and that in the longer\nterm we have the tools, and the steadfast commitment, to address inflationary pressures.\nIndeed, while monetary policy works with lags, I would note that it has been more than\ntwo years since the Fed’s balance sheet expanded dramatically. Since that time, core inflation\nhas fallen and core inflation measures using the CPI or PCE indexes are at something like 50\nyear lows.\nToday I will briefly address the role of the low inflation rate for the economy and\npolicymaking. In doing so, I will discuss why inflation concerns have not materialized to date,\nand why I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next several years.\n\nQuestion 1: Housing and the Economic Recovery\nThe economic recovery officially began in the third quarter of 2009, according to the\norganization responsible for dating our recessions – the National Bureau of Economic Research\n(NBER). Despite being a year and a half into the official recovery, the recovery period has been\nso tepid that there has been very little improvement in the percentage of the population employed\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n(see Figure 1). The percent of the population employed in December was 58.3, close to the low\nof this cycle and below the 59.3 percent employed in July of 2009, when the recovery officially\nstarted. For context, the number was around 63 percent when the recession began. The recent\nstability of the employment-to-population ratio reflects the poor labor market performance of the\ncurrent recovery. We are simply not generating enough jobs to reduce the number of\nunemployed persons. Nor are we, by the way, providing job opportunities for the so-called\n“discouraged workers” who have given up looking for work.\nWhat we call final sales – growth in GDP excluding inventory replenishment – has grown\nquite slowly over the past year and a half. Figure 2 shows that the growth to date has been\nsubstantially slower than during the 1982 recovery, and is tracking quite closely to the weak\nrecovery experienced in the early 2000s. As many economists anticipated, the recovery has been\ntepid given the fact that it comes in the wake of a collapse in a housing bubble with resulting\nfinancial market turmoil and disruption.\nThe largest GDP component is consumption, and consumption has not grown very\nquickly. As Figure 3 shows, in the current recovery, growth in consumption has been much\nslower than in the 1982 recovery and has, unfortunately, tracked the anemic initial recovery from\nthe 2001 recession. While the 2001 recession damaged many a household’s finances, through an\nabrupt decline in stock-market wealth, the current recovery has been hampered by households\ntrying to rebuild their finances given sharply diminished housing wealth in addition to declines in\nthe value of their other investments.\nWhile there have been concerns about business fixed investment, Figure 4 shows that\nthis component of GDP has grown quite well relative to the last two recoveries – although\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsomewhat slower than the 1982 recovery. Despite the concern over economic uncertainty voiced\nby many businesses, investment has been growing.\nThe real laggard in this recovery has been housing. While housing is a relatively small\ncomponent of GDP, it can be quite volatile – and often grows rapidly during an economic\nrecovery. In addition, purchases of appliances, home furnishings, and housing-related services\nare impacted by slowed housing activity. Given the problems that flow from the bursting of the\nhousing bubble, Figure 5 shows that residential fixed investment is roughly where it was at the\ntrough of the recession – and thus not providing its more usual contribution to growth in the\nearly stages of a recovery.\nJust how moribund the housing market has been is shown in Figure 6. Both housing\nstarts and building permits have leveled off, but are showing no signs of a significant recovery\nyet.\nInterest rates are quite low by historical standards, while the equity component of\nhousehold net worth is improving, as shown in Figure 7. And we have seen some positive\nimprovement in real disposable income. Given all that, one would normally anticipate that\nhousing would be improving.\nHowever, lower interest rates are only helpful if credit is available. Figure 8 shows that\nthe number of purchase loans to prime borrowers has been declining, while the subprime market\nis dormant.1 The left side of Figure 9 shows the distribution of all home-purchase loans by\ncredit score in 2006 (before the financial crisis) and in 2010.2 It is striking how the distribution\nof purchase mortgages has changed. Credit standards have tightened, as evidenced by a shift to\nborrowers with higher credit scores. Given what has happened to housing prices, and\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunemployment, lenders are presumably more cautious in lending. Far fewer loans are going to\nborrowers with credit scores below 625, and many more purchase loans are going to borrowers\nwith credit scores above 750. In 2006, about 15 percent of the purchase loans were to borrowers\nwith credit scores below 625, but by 2010, this fraction had fallen to only 3.5 percent.\nThe decline in loans to borrowers with sub-625 scores has not completely resulted from\nthe decline in subprime lending. The right side of the figure shows the credit-score distributions\namong prime loans, and a similar rightward shift in the distribution is apparent. From 2006 to\n2010, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with sub-625 credit scores fell from\n8.5 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with\nscores above 750 rose from about 35 percent to about 41 percent.\nWhile I am certainly not advocating going back to the loose lending standards of, say,\n2006, I think we should be aware of how changes in the distribution have implications for the\nhousing recovery. In particular, I would suggest that current lending standards are another\nreason the housing sector’s role in the recovery is likely to be weaker than usual.\nIn addition to the challenge of availability of credit to borrowers with low credit ratings,\nhousing has another issue. Both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates are quite high, as\nshown in Figure 10 – although there has been recent improvement in these rates, and hopefully\nthe trend is now downward. High vacancy rates, of course, place downward pressure on home\nprices and rental rates, and serve as another headwind to a housing recovery.\nSo again, all in all and despite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing\nrecovery, I expect that housing will not provide as much support to this recovery as it has in\nprevious ones.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nBut now I’d like to turn to the second question, and perhaps leave you feeling a bit less\ndiscouraged when we’re through.\n\nQuestion 2: Inflation, Policy, and the Economic Recovery\nA second key question involves the concerns about Fed actions stoking inflation. This\nquestion is not a distinct and separate issue from the one we just discussed – the strength of the\nrecovery. In fact they are crucially related. If housing-related growth is not going to boost the\nrecovery this time around, we may need policy – particularly monetary policy – to continue\nplaying a stimulative role.\nBut it is important to look at possible costs of stimulative policy, as well as benefits. If\ninflation were to become a problem that would certainly fall in the costs column. But if analysis\nsuggests that inflation is not likely to be a problem, then we can more comfortably align policy to\ncontinue supporting the recovery.\nSome observers and analysts have voiced great concern that the nascent economic\nrecovery, combined with the actions of the Federal Reserve that have expanded its balance sheet,\nwill lead to significant inflation. However, Figure 11 provides a variety of different measures of\ncore inflation; core CPI, core PCE, trimmed core CPI and trimmed core PCE. It is striking how\nmuch all four series have declined. In fact many of these series are at their historical lows.\nFigure 12 shows the different measures of core inflation in the top panel, and the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet in the bottom panel. In the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet expanded significantly – but that period also corresponds to the emergence of disinflation\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n(a reduction in the inflation rate) in the U.S. While monetary policy works with lags, why has\nthe unprecedented increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet corresponded with continued\nsignificant disinflation? The answer is that both have been reacting to an unprecedented\nfinancial shock, which resulted in significant excess capacity in the economy.\nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases assets and expands its balance sheet, it necessarily\ninjects more reserves into the banking system. The key question is what banks do with those\nreserves. Reserves held by the banking system that are not used to provide credit to businesses\nwill have little bearing on either real spending or inflation. The 2009 line in Figure 13 shows\nthat the expansion of bank reserves has not generated increases in lending. As with the 1991\nrecovery, where a credit crunch impeded expansion of bank lending, there has not been an\nexpansion of lending during this recovery. This is particularly noticeable if we look at business\nlending, in Figure 14. Commercial and industrial loans are substantially lower than at the\nrecession trough.\nOf course, those who worry about the inflationary consequences of our balance sheet may\nbe looking to the future. As the economy improves, banks may use their reserves to rapidly\nexpand business lending – increasing economic activity and putting upward pressure on\ninflation. But as Chairman Bernanke has emphasized, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal a\nvariety of tools that will allow it to remove reserves from the banking system once economic\nconditions get closer to normal. Thus the fear that our large balance sheet and the large stock of\nreserves in the banking system will cause inflation – either now or down the road – seems\nmisplaced to me.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nWhile we have been experiencing disinflation generally, it is not the case for all prices.\nAs Figure 15 shows, some prices have risen rapidly. Energy prices in particular have been\nrising, in response to robust growth in emerging markets. But outside of energy prices, most\nprices have shown little increase, and in fact a number of the major categories in the CPI index\nhave experienced declines in prices.\nTo be clear, the Fed certainly cares about increases in energy prices, for two reasons.\nFirst, higher energy prices could potentially bring about long-lasting increases in the overall\ninflation rate. The Fed therefore monitors energy prices closely, given our mandate to keep\noverall inflation low and stable. Second, rising energy prices act as a tax on households and\nbusinesses, who often find it difficult to reduce their consumption of energy in the short run.3\nWith regard to the first concern, our research suggests that the lasting effect of energy\nprices on overall inflation has been surprisingly small in recent years. For evidence, consider the\nenormous surges in oil prices in mid-2008, which were followed by significant declines in core\ninflation, as I mentioned earlier.\nThe second concern remains, however. In sum, my primary concern about rising energy\nprices is not so much that they will lead to higher inflation, but that they will subtract from\nhousehold income and thus weaken the economy.\nFinancial markets are also not expecting sharply higher rates of inflation. The difference\nbetween the 10 year Treasury rate and the 10 year inflation-protected Treasury security (TIPS)\nrate provides a measure of the expected average inflation rate over the next decade. As shown in\nFigure 16, the average expected inflation rate by this measure is still below what the markets\nexpected prior to the recession and the necessary expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConcluding Observations\nThankfully, we are seeing signs that the economy is experiencing a more self-sustaining\nrecovery. However, it is important not to lose sight of how much excess capacity remains. It is\nlikely to take at least four years to return to full employment from the current unemployment rate\nof 9.4 percent. It is also likely that measures of core inflation will remain well below 2 percent\nover the same period. This suggests that the signs of improvement we have seen so far are not\nworrisome, but are most welcome. A sustained period of the economy growing well above its\npotential – not just for a few quarters – is exactly what we need.\nThe current level of accommodation from monetary and fiscal policy is appropriate.\nHowever, once the economy has significantly improved, both fiscal and monetary policy will\nneed to be much less accommodative. Getting this balance right will be one of the main policy\nchallenges over the next several years. I am confident that the Fed’s Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) will meet the challenge.\nFinally, I’d like to note that even with some early signs of economic improvement, a\nnumber of risks remain. As I have highlighted today, the housing market remains fragile and is\nnot likely to contribute to economic recovery in its traditional way – and this is part of why I do\nnot expect growth to exceed 4 percent in 2011. Furthermore, in many areas of the country the\nimpaired balance sheets of borrowers, high foreclosures, and high vacancy rates imply a long\ntime before local housing markets normalize. State and local governments remain significantly\nchallenged by the aftershocks of the financial crisis and recession. And many state and local\ngovernments continue to have both short-run and long-run fiscal challenges.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinally, the large fiscal deficits of many governments accrued during the recession will\nneed to be addressed. And as Figure 17 shows, financial markets are concerned that many\ncountries will be forced to make very painful fiscal choices – in economies with already\nsignificant challenges – or risk default.\nYet while risks like these remain, the economy is in a much better place than it was one\nor two years ago. Fiscal and monetary policy responded aggressively, and in my view\nappropriately, to avoid what would have been a much more severe outcome, absent action.\nThere will be a time when these aggressive actions need to be reversed, but first we need\nto get the economy on a much more solid footing. Even with a relatively robust recovery, it will\ntake several years before we attain full employment and an inflation rate close to a long-run\nexpectation of 2 percent. Taken together there has been clear room for – and indeed an\nimperative for – policy actions like those the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.4 Going\nforward our focus must be on policies that return the economy to a place that meets both\nelements of the Fed’s mandate.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nFigures 8 and 9 are based on data from McDash Analytics LLC, a subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.\nThe McDash data contain loan-level data from mortgage servicers, and cover more than half of all outstanding\nmortgages in the United States. The number of servicers contributing to the McDash dataset is growing over time,\nso the decline in purchase loans depicted in Figure 8 probably understates the true decline in lending to a small\nextent. The 2010 distributions reflect data through November 2010.\n2\n\nThe share of subprime loans in the McDash data is generally smaller than the true subprime share of U.S.\nmortgages. To create Figure 9, subprime loans in the McDash data were “upweighted,” so that the adjusted\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M.

The benchmark figure used for the\nweighting is based on the top panel of Figure 1B in Mayer and Pence (2008): “Subprime Mortgages: What, Where\nand to Whom?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper No. 2008-29, Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System – available on the Board of Governors website at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/PUBS/FEDS/2008/200829/200829pap.pdf\n3\n\nThe first effect would lead Fed policy to be slightly less accommodative while the latter effect would lead it to be\nslightly more accommodative.\n\n4\n\nFor additional perspective, see Vice Chair Janet Yellen’s remarks of January 10, where she discusses the rationale,\ndesign, and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program; and concerns about inflation or adverse\nimbalances resulting.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nGreater Providence Chamber of Commerce\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nNovember 17, 2010\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you here in Providence. Over the past 25 years\nor so, my family and I have followed and enjoyed the rebirth that happened in Providence – from\ntrying some of the great downtown restaurants to occasionally taking in the WaterFire\ncelebration.\nHowever, I have also witnessed what has happened to many Rhode Island communities\nover the past three years, as a result of the recession. Rhode Island has suffered to an even larger\nextent than the rest of New England. Despite the downtown rebirth I mentioned, unfortunately a\ndrive today through Providence includes some empty storefronts and foreclosure signs.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nSo, it is particularly appropriate to be in Rhode Island to discuss what national monetary\npolicy is doing to address economic problems, here and around the country. *\nThere has been a great deal of attention paid to the monetary policy actions that were\ninitiated by the Federal Reserve at the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.\nThere has been much commentary, from a wide range of observers, on our decision to pursue\nlarge scale asset purchases. Given the intensity of the public debate, I have decided to take a\nsomewhat different approach today than I usually do in my talks. Today I am going to do my\nbest to answer the five questions I most often hear about these recent monetary policy actions in\nmy conversations and meetings around New England.\n\n[Slide 2]\nQuestion 1 is, Why was policy changed at the November FOMC meeting?\nBefore we look at the data, I’ll preview my answer. The policy change we at the Fed just\nannounced was consistent with the central bank’s mandate, given how far the national economy\nis from our gauges of health.\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, has provided significant guidance\nover the years on what should be our primary areas of focus. Unlike some foreign central banks\nthat only have one target – price stability – the Federal Reserve has been tasked with pursuing\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nthe lowest possible unemployment rate consistent with price stability. So we refer to a “dual\nmandate,” meaning both maximum employment and stable prices.\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC – the presidents of the\nReserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors in Washington – all provide\nquarterly estimates of where we expect inflation and unemployment to be in the long-run. We\ncan consider those long-run estimates to reflect what members see as achieving our dual mandate\nfor price stability and maximum sustainable employment. According to past submissions, most\nmembers expect that inflation is likely to settle close to 2 percent and that the unemployment rate\nis likely to settle between 5 and 6 percent, in the long run.\nObviously the national economy is quite some distance from those long-run targets. And\nin places like Rhode Island, the gap is even larger. From a national perspective, Figure 1\nhighlights that the unemployment rate, which is currently 9.6 percent, has been well above that 5\nto 6 percent range for some time, as a result of the long recession. Most of this unemployment\nlikely reflects the dramatic decline in demand for goods and services that characterized the\nrecession. With inadequate demand leading to very high unemployment rates, one would\ngenerally expect that such a large gap (in relation to the long-run target) would yield a strong\nbias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nTurning to the stable prices side of our dual mandate, Figure 2 shows that core inflation\nhas fallen quite significantly. The core consumer price index or CPI, which had been above 2\npercent before the recession, is now below 1 percent. With the current amount of slack in the\nlabor markets, it is certainly possible that inflation could fall further. Thus, on inflation we are\nalso far from where we want and expect to be in the longer run – and we are continuing to\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nexperience disinflationary pressures. Again, such a large gap on the inflation side of our\nmandate should provide a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nIn short you see unemployment close to double the mandate-consistent target, and\ninflation about half of what we consider consistent with price stability.\nStill, an argument against further monetary easing could be made if one thought the\neconomy was about to take off. But are things about to turn, or turning now – as some suggest?\nUnfortunately, recent data have not been particularly encouraging. Figure 3 shows that GDP\n(shown in blue) grew by only 2 percent in the third quarter. Even less encouraging is the fact\nthat final sales (shown in green) – which is a better measure of demand for our products, since it\nexcludes inventory investment from the GDP number – was quite anemic in the third quarter,\nand indeed growth in final sales has been falling over the past four quarters. As I have noted in\nprior talks, we are likely to need four to five years of relatively strong growth (above “potential”)\nto bring the unemployment rate down significantly (to a rate consistent with “full\nemployment”1).\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that the growth in final sales from the low point of the\nrecession (shown in the dark line extending out five quarters) has been quite weak, and certainly\nin the weak camp among previous recessions. With these doubts as to the strength of final sales\nshown in the data, one has to question the likelihood that, other things equal, the economy will\ngrow fast enough to significantly reduce the unemployment rate in an acceptable timeframe and\nreduce these disinflationary pressures.\nWith both employment and inflation falling short of the long-run expectations that reflect\nthe Fed’s mandate, one would expect additional accommodative monetary policy. However,\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nwith the federal funds rate close to zero, the Fed’s usual policy tool could not be utilized.\nHowever, monetary policy can still be conducted. The asset-purchase policy announced at the\nNovember FOMC meeting was in my view strongly consistent with our dual mandate from\nCongress – in other words, the pursuit of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.\nStill, some have argued very forcefully that we should not have taken further action. This\nleads to the second question.\n\n[Slide 7]\nQuestion 2 is, What is the likely cost of not changing monetary policy?\nAgain, as we turn to the evidence, let me sum up my answer to this important and at\ntimes overlooked question. Not changing policy risked further disinflation, a rise in the real cost\nof funds tantamount to monetary tightening, and risks of continued and possibly worsening pain\nin labor markets. Allow me to explain.\nFigure 5 highlights how severe the recession has been, in terms of output. We saw\ndramatic declines in GDP in the United States (the black line), but the chart shows that many\nother countries experienced an even more severe decline in output, and for some countries it is\nnot clear they have reached their recession trough as yet. Particularly in Europe, where some\ncountries have had sovereign debt problems and significant fiscal austerity, the output decline is\nstriking.\nWhile that chart shows that in fact the impact on output was lesser in the U.S. than in\nmany countries, Figure 6 shows that the impact on labor markets here in the U.S. has been more\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsevere than in most countries; in fact, only severely distressed Spain and Ireland have seen a\nbigger effect on employment. The U.S., again shown by the black line, is still well below the\npeak employment of prior to the onset of the recession, and the decline has been more significant\nthan in many other countries. Firms in the U.S. moved particularly aggressively to cut jobs,\nparticularly as the recession deepened in the aftermath of financial problems in the fall of 2008.\nFigure 7 shows one of the problems with labor markets remaining extremely weak for a\nprotracted period. The percent of jobless workers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or\nmore is over 40 percent. This is much higher than in recent recessions, as you can see in the\nshaded recession sections of the chart. In fact, it is the highest reading on record for this series.\nLong periods of unemployment can have particularly corrosive effects. Not only do\npeople have to deplete their savings, but unfortunately long-term unemployed job-seekers can\nfind it quite difficult to re-enter the workforce – because skills may atrophy and because hiring\nfirms may shun those who have been unemployed for a long time. In short, there are real and\nsignificant long-term costs to individuals and the economy when the unemployment rate remains\nstubbornly high.\nAllow me to walk you through the next couple of charts, which highlight that it can be\ncostly to not do anything to counteract further disinflation. As those of you in this room know,\nmany economic decisions are influenced by the real cost of borrowing. Figure 8 gives us a\nhistorical perspective, going back to 1980, comparing in the top chart the short-term federal\nfunds rate and the inflation rate. The bottom chart shows what you get when you put the two\ntogether – the real federal funds rate resulting from the effective rate minus the change in the\ncore CPI.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIf we simply narrow the time frame of the chart, as in Figure 9, we see clearly that if\nshort-term interest rates are fixed – say at about the zero bound, as now – but the inflation rate\ndeclines, then the real interest rate actually increases. You see this in the red line on the bottom\nchart. As a result, a decline in the inflation rate when interest rates are fixed amounts to\nmonetary tightening. Given the state of the economy, a monetary contraction right now is both\nunintended and undesirable. So we want to prevent any further disinflation – not only because it\ngets us closer to a harmful deflationary situation, but also because it represents a monetary\ntightening when conditions are indicating that further accommodation is desirable.\nIf the federal funds rate was not close to zero right now, the arguments for reducing it –\nthat is, for easing in monetary policy – would be quite strong. However, the federal funds rate is\nquite close to zero. And this leads us to the third question.\n\n[Slide 13]\nQuestion 3 is, How Different are large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from traditional\nmonetary policy?\nBefore we look at the data, I’ll preview my answer to this question. Are large-scale asset\npurchases a fundamentally different policy, either in intent and mechanics? The answer is no,\nLSAPs are much closer to traditional monetary policy than many commentators assume. We\nsimply move in other markets than the federal funds market. And, like traditional monetary\npolicy actions, we’re not talking about “bailouts” or stimulus spending or placing a debt burden\non future generations. Let me explain.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nIn more normal times when the FOMC wants to ease monetary policy, we buy Treasury\nbills and, in paying the sellers for them2, we create additional bank reserves. By making more\nreserves available to the banking system, we ease conditions in the overnight market for funds –\nthe federal funds market – so the primary impact of these purchases is a reduction in the federal\nfunds rate. But more importantly for the economy, we expect the reduction in the funds rate to\nover time translate into declines in mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, exchange rates, and a\nrise in stock prices – all of which of course help stimulate economic activity.\nNow that the federal funds rate is near zero and the reserves in the system are quite large,\nthe usual course is not an option. Instead of relying on the indirect effects of targeting a lower\nfunds rate, we are opting to more directly affect the interest rates that have the greatest\nconnection to real spending; by buying Treasury bonds and creating additional bank reserves.\nSince there are already substantial reserves in the system, the primary expected effect is lowering\nthe long rate by purchasing a significant amount of longer-term Treasury bonds. Like\nconventional policy, one would expect that mortgage and corporate rates will fall, and exchange\nrates will be impacted, providing additional stimulus to the economy. That is in fact what has\nalready happened, which leads to Question 4.\n\n[Slide 14]\nQuestion 4 is, What has been the impact of the LSAP to date?\nBefore we explore the data, I’ll again share the punch line, which is that these policy\nactions, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, have basically had the expected\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\neffects and – despite some short-run volatility as we get under way – should be broadly effective\nand helpful to the economy going forward.\nStarting with Chairman Bernanke’s Jackson Hole speech, the markets have gradually\ncome to expect that more monetary accommodation was likely. As a result, the impact on\nfinancial markets of any easing was likely incorporated into prices prior to the actual\nannouncement. The next set of charts highlights that the effects one might expect from a\nconventional monetary accommodation do indeed seem to have occurred in anticipation of this\nless-conventional action.3\nI should note that while longer rates have been trending down as desired, there has been\nsome recent movement up, too. Lots of things affect rates in the marketplace, but I am certain\nthat our purchases over time will contribute to lower rates than we would otherwise be seeing.\nFigure 10 explores inflation expectations, and highlights the fact that the implied\ninflation rate over the next 10 years as measured by the difference between the 10-year Treasury\nyield and the 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury yield had fallen to well below 2 percent. As the\nmarkets began to anticipate the LSAP program, the implied inflation rate has risen to a little over\n2 percent. Thus, the action seems to have convinced market participants that further\ndisinflationary pressures in the U.S. were likely to be resisted by monetary policy.\nFigure 11 shows that corporate bond rates and mortgage rates have fallen over this\nperiod, although there has been an uptick over the last couple of days. Lower rates on these\ninstruments will make it easier for firms to finance investments and for home buyers to purchase\nhomes, all other things equal.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFigure 12 shows that there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar exchange rate. While not\na goal of our policies, this should stimulate exports and reduce imports. It is important to reemphasize that in the U.S., as in any country with a flexible exchange rate system, a modest\ncurrency depreciation is the normal consequence of easing monetary policy. By lowering shortand long-term interest rates, investors will, on the margin, seek assets that provide somewhat\ngreater returns than U.S. assets, and in the process, will lower the demand for dollars and\ndepreciate our currency.\nWhile this is an issue that has been passionately discussed in many parts of the globe, I\nthink it is important to note – as shown on Figure 13 – that the current trade weighted exchange\nrate is really not much different than what it was before the recession. Exchange rates have at\ntimes fluctuated for a variety of reasons during this period, including periods of so-called flight\nto quality that pushed U.S. rates down, and periods of flight from European currencies as a result\nof some sovereign debt issues – both of which tended to push the dollar up. At the same time,\nthe data show that the Federal Reserve’s current monetary accommodation to date has merely\nhelped restore the dollar exchange rate to the level it was three years ago.\nFigure 14 shows that the stock market has generally risen over the last several months,\ndespite some downward movement over the last couple of days. While this is not a targeted goal\nof our policy, it is an indicator that the combination of lower rates and better economic prospects\nare being manifested in a rise in stock prices. This increases household wealth for those who\nown stocks and should provide for somewhat stronger consumption, going forward.\nFigure 15 provides some rough estimates of what the impact of the LSAP easing could\nbe, over time, using the Boston Fed’s internal simulation models. While such estimates are by\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nnature quite uncertain, we estimate that the impact could be a reduction in the unemployment\nrate by the end of 2012 of a little less than half a percent. This would translate into more than\n700,000 additional jobs that we would not have had in the absence of this monetary policy\naction.\nIn short this action, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, has broadly\nspeaking had the expected short-run effect and should be helpful going forward. This leads to\nthe final question.\n\n[Slide 21]\nQuestion 5 is, What are the risks of the current policy?\nThe short answer is that there are – of course – some risks. We should not gloss over\nthem, but neither should we overstate them. I am very confident that they can be managed and\nare worth taking.\nNormally the Federal Reserve buys primarily short-term securities. By purchasing longterm securities the Federal Reserve is in fact taking on the risk that their value will fall as interest\nrates rise. The reason is that as interest rates rise above the rates paid on the securities we hold,\nthe lower-rate securities we hold will (not surprisingly) fall in value, as investors favor the\nhigher-rate newer-issue securities. Of course, an environment in which most interest rates were\nrising would imply an economy where disinflation was no longer a problem, which is one of the\nmacroeconomic outcomes the policy is indeed seeking. But in fact the Fed has a number of\noptions and plenty of flexibility to manage the holdings in the best interests of the economy and\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\ntaxpayers. We could hold instruments to maturity, or could sell securities of certain maturities.\nAnd, of course, interest income will accrue. I believe the most likely net outcome will actually\nbe a benefit to the taxpayer, although that is not the objective of our balance sheet moves (rather,\nour dual mandate is).\nA second risk arises from the fact that the Treasury market is quite large – much larger\nthan the federal funds market in which we normally operate. While relatively small purchases of\nsecurities during normal times can be sufficient to move the federal funds rate, it takes large\nasset purchases to have a significant impact on a market as large and deep as the Treasury bond\nmarket. As a result, this policy requires the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet much\nmore than would a traditional monetary easing. Large expansions of the balance sheet can\ncomplicate exit strategy, when that becomes appropriate. While the Federal Reserve has a\nvariety of tools designed to tighten policy, either by raising interest on excess reserves, removing\nreserves, or selling securities, some of these tools have not been used in the past. Naturally this\nmakes the exact impact of various tools somewhat more uncertain than normal. Still, I am very\nconfident of the Fed’s ability and will to exit, when necessary.\nA third risk is that these measures have not been conducted in the United States, at least\nat the current scale. While there are many similarities with typical monetary policy and several\nother countries (for example Japan and the U.K.) have also been pursuing large scale asset\npurchases, the lack of recent U.S. historical precedent makes the possibility of unintended\nconsequences higher than with more typical monetary policy actions.\nAnother risk is that we might be too successful in raising inflation. Thus any policy\naction needs to take care to make clear that the desire is to maintain well-anchored inflation\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nexpectations. But this can best be achieved by insuring that inflation does not get too high nor\ntoo low.\nFinally, some have argued that the Fed is embarking on a policy of monetizing the federal\ndebt. I would counter that this is a temporary monetary policy action taken to return inflation\nand unemployment somewhat more quickly than otherwise to levels consistent with our\nmandate. It is a policy designed to help reduce longer term rates over a fixed period of time, not\nat all a policy to finance government debt indefinitely. I have noted in previous talks that it is\nimportant to provide short-term stimulus, given the current economic situation, but that long-run\nbudget projections are not sustainable and will need to be addressed. It is important to note that\nlarge scale asset purchases do not necessarily need to use Treasury-security purchases to\nstimulate the economy; indeed in our first round we did so with mortgage-backed securities.\nSo all in all there are of course risks to evaluate in light of the current state of the\neconomy and our mandate. We are aware of these risks. I fully expect that we will be able to\nmanage them.\n\n[Slide 22]\nConcluding Observations\nAs I conclude I would like to reiterate that the actions taken earlier this month are\nconsistent with the important mandates that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve in terms of\nemployment (reflecting growth) and prices. With unemployment so high and inflation unusually\nlow, most models indicate that further monetary accommodation is warranted. In addition, I\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nbelieve the cost of having high unemployment rates for an extended period of time, or likewise\nfurther disinflation, could be quite high and potentially very damaging.\nThe recently announced LSAP program has many similarities with more typical\nmonetary policy actions, but of course there are risks with any policy that we have not had\nsignificant experience with. Nonetheless, the initial reactions seem similar to what we would\nhave expected from more typical monetary policy. And the Fed has the tools to minimize its\nown particular risks.\nIn short, these actions are likely to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the risk of\nfurther disinflation relative to not taking action. This is exactly what I hoped would be the result\nof the program.\nLet me leave you with an analogy – and a seasonally appropriate one at that. This past\nweekend, many New Englanders woke up to a lawn full of leaves. Many took out their lawn\nmower intending to get to work picking up those leaves. When pulling on the starter cord, some\nno doubt heard the engine sputter and cough. The immediate reaction is to fiddle with the choke\nswitch and give a little more gas to the engine. Once you get the engine started and running\nsmoothly, you still have the task of mowing up all those leaves. But you won’t make any\nprogress unless you first get the engine operating. And so it is with monetary policy. Our\neconomy has been faltering and sputtering, so it was necessary to take some steps to get it\nactually “running.” Of course this Fed policy will not solve the economy’s problems, just as\ngetting the motor started does not in and of itself take care of the leaves in your yard. Solving\nthe economy’s problems will take time and actions by the public and private sectors – but getting\nthe economic engine running is the essential first step to the broader work ahead.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 8:20 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nRevisiting Monetary Policy in a\nLow Inflation Environment:\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston’s 55th Economic Conference\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 16, 2010\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nI’d like to welcome everyone to the second day of our conference. As has been\nmentioned already, this is in some sense a retrospective. The first conference on monetary\npolicy in a low inflation environment was held in Vermont in October of 1999. I would note that\nseveral speakers we will hear from today also provided comments at that gathering 10 years ago,\nand I am pleased to have them back in New England to see if a decade of relevant data has\ninfluenced their thinking on the topic. *\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n[Slide 2] At that conference, Alan Blinder was on the policy panel, a place he finds\nhimself again today. He said at the time that it was of some interest that the conference was\nbeing held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and not in Japan or Europe. One might attribute the\nlocation to unusually good forecasting prowess evidenced by our Research Director, Jeff Fuhrer,\nwho was actively engaged in organizing the earlier conference as well as this one.\nThe earlier conference took place under very different economic circumstances. It was\nheld in the midst of the period that I believe Jim Stock named “the Great Moderation,” reflecting\nthe reduced volatility we were seeing in unemployment and inflation. There was a growing\nsense of confidence that severe business cycles had been tamed, as policymakers better\nunderstood and calibrated fiscal and monetary policy. At the time of the conference, the\nunemployment rate was 4.1 percent and the core inflation rate was 2.1 percent. 1\nDespite the propitious economic environment at the time, I will say that participants at\nthe conference said quite clearly that monetary policy in a low inflation environment would be\nquite challenging.\n[Slide 3] Perhaps the best summary of this concern was provided those ten years ago by\nKazuo Ueda, who is on the policy panel again this time. His summary of policy when the zero\nbound was hit was that “it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.”\nUnfortunately, his comments have been accurate and prophetic – and quoted rather prominently\nof late.\nPerhaps, as well, they were more true in Japan than anywhere else in the world. At the\ntime of our first conference on this topic, many participants were expecting the Japanese\ndeflation to be quickly eradicated and the country to be “on the mend.” Now, more than a\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ndecade later, Japan continues to combat deflation with its policy still running up against the zero\nlower bound.\nOther participants at the earlier conference for the most part viewed Japan as an anomaly,\nand seemed to think that the likelihood of others ending up in Japan’s predicament was quite\nlow. Unfortunately, that probability seems to have shifted, and we now face a world where\nJapan, Europe, and the U.S. are challenged by the need to conduct monetary policy with shortterm interest rates close to zero.\nAll in all, there was some disagreement over how effective alternate policies could be,\nbut there was a sense that there was little reason not to try them, should circumstances merit it.\n[Slide 4] Figure 1 highlights just how different this so-called Great Recession has been.\nThe chart shows the percent employment change from the peak of employment in post-war\nrecessions. The scale of the job loss during this recession, shown by the black line, is sobering.\n[Slide 5] Another feature of this Great Recession involves the significant difficulties\nwithin financial institutions and financial markets, and the contributions of those difficulties to\nthe economic downturn. While at the earlier conference there was due concern about the\nbanking and financial systems, I think it fair to say that the role that financial institutions and\nmarkets can play in aggravating the business cycle was not fully appreciated. A challenge that\nremains is how best to incorporate financial market developments in our economic models, as\nmuch of the modeling only rather poorly captures the role of financial intermediation.\n[Slide 6] It goes without saying that the circumstances surrounding this conference are\nvery different than those of ten years ago. Unfortunately at today’s conference, unlike ten years\nago, we find unemployment at 9.6 percent, core CPI inflation well below 2 percent, and short3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nterm interest rates bound by zero. Japan is still fighting deflation. So the problems faced by\npolicymakers in the United States and abroad are no longer just matters of academic debate.\nToday I would like to briefly discuss how we should, in my opinion, interpret some of the\ndata and experience we have seen since that prior conference. In particular, I would like to draw\nsome observations from the Japanese experience, and from the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale\nAsset Purchase (LSAP) Program.\n\nThe Case of Japan\n[Slide 7] Japan is the one industrialized country that has faced the zero bound and\ndeflation problem for well over a decade. I would note several points we can draw from Japan’s\nbattle with deflation.\n\n•\n\nFirst, while the Japanese stock market and real estate markets peaked in 1990, and\nwere substantially off their peak prices in the middle of the 1990s, the core inflation\nrate remained low but definitely positive (as shown in Figure 2). While every such\nsituation is unique, the conditions in Japan that moved a low-inflation environment to\none of actually falling prices were monetary and fiscal tightening, and also deferring\nthe process of addressing significant problems in the financial sector.\n\n•\n\n[Slide 8] Second, it is worth noting that Japan and Europe and the United States are\nfacing substantial challenges in monetary policymaking, in part because of lingering\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfinancial problems. Because the transmission of monetary policy occurs through the\nbanking system, impaired banking systems and financial markets greatly complicate\nthe conduct of monetary policy.\n\n•\n\nThird, the fact that Japan is still battling deflation highlights how pernicious deflation\ncan be, and how difficult it is to counteract once it has been firmly established.\n\n[Slide 9] It is important to note that Japan has significantly altered monetary and fiscal\npolicy to try to address its deflation problems. For fiscal policy, as shown in Figure 3, Japan has\nmore than tripled its debt-to-GDP ratio since the early 1990s, as the government has tried to\nignite the economy with more expansionary fiscal policy.\n[Slide 10] Similarly, the Bank of Japan has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet\nsince 1990, to try to combat deflation – as shown in Figure 4.\n[Slide 11] These expansionary monetary and fiscal policies no doubt prevented deflation\nfrom being a much more severe problem than it nonetheless has been. Concerns expressed at our\nearlier conference, and many economic models, highlighted a risk of a strong deflationary spiral,\ngiven the significant slack in the Japanese economy. Thankfully, policy did prevent this severe\noutcome. However, it was not sufficient to prevent a low but persistent degree of deflation. This\nexperience may indicate that a gradual response may not be as effective as a more active\nresponse to arrest deflationary pressures – before they become embedded in thinking that can\naffect household and business spending.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFrom a policy perspective I take several lessons from the Japanese experience. First,\nshould deflation occur, it can be quite difficult to overcome. Second, insuring against the risk of\ndeflation may be much cheaper than waiting until it has occurred and then trying to address it.\nFinally, financially fragile economies may be particularly vulnerable to negative impacts from\npremature austerity measures.\n\nMonetary Policy Lessons from the LSAP Program\n[Slide 12] Now I would like to touch on some lessons for monetary policy from the\nLSAP program. As you know, after reaching the zero lower bound in rate-setting and seeing\ncontinued problems in economic outcomes, the Federal Reserve made a policy decision to\npurchase large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market, in its Large\nScale Asset Purchase or “LSAP” program. Because such programs are relatively new\nphenomena in the United States, it was difficult to predict with precision how the economy\nwould react. 2 Without good historical experience to rely on, and because we are operating at the\nzero bound for the first time in post-war history, it is important to use the evidence we have to\ndraw out a better understanding of LSAP programs and related channels.\nThere are many potential impediments to accurately measuring the effects of the LSAP\nprogram. First, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the program from other relevant changes\nsuch as shifts in fiscal policy, changes in policies of major trading partners, or developments in\nsupervisory or regulatory policies that can have an impact on financial markets. Second, these\nprograms have been operating when many economic and financial variables are outside their\nnormal ranges. Thus, the impact of the program may differ depending on economic and\nfinancial conditions prevalent during their operation. Third, to the extent that policy changes are\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nanticipated, the effect of a policy change may be difficult to measure with any degree of\ncertainty.\n[Slide 13] Despite these challenges, many researchers have begun to evaluate the policy\nchannels that are impacted by an LSAP program. 3 While there is much work to be done, and the\nsample of U.S. experience is fairly limited, allow me to provide my own take on the evidence\nthat is currently available.\n[Slide 14] Figure 5 shows the impact on mortgage rates of the announcements of the\nLSAP program – when it was first announced and at the March FOMC meeting when the\nparameters of the initial program were detailed.\nSince the initial program focused on purchases of mortgage securities, one might expect\nthe largest impact to be on mortgage rates. Mortgage rates that had been trading at 6 percent\nprior to the announcements declined to roughly 5 percent. Empirical event studies that try to\ncorrect for possible confounding events tend to find an impact on mortgage rates in the range of\n25 to 100 basis points. Thus, I think the empirical evidence supports the view that an LSAP\nprogram can influence the market rate of the asset being purchased. Certainly the impact may be\ninfluenced by the economic and financial conditions at the time of the announcement and\npurchase. The scale of the program should be sensitive to the prevailing conditions, and the size\nof the program would need to vary to accomplish a particular interest rate outcome.\n[Slide 15] An LSAP program will be most effective if it not only influences the rates on\nassets being purchased, but also influences rates on other assets with similar characteristics. For\nexample, purchases of mortgage securities are likely to influence the price and yield of other\nlong-term securities that may also be held by investors looking for long-term assets. As the rate\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\non MBS securities falls, some investors will look to buy these other assets, and the increased\ndemand will bid up their prices and push down their rates.\n[Slide 16] Indeed, as Figure 6 highlights, other long-term rates did fall with the LSAP\nannouncements. Both long-term Treasury and corporate bond rates fell with the announcements.\nSeveral studies have concluded that the cross-correlation is relatively high, indicating that a\nbroader array of long-term rates will be influenced by an LSAP program. Thus, the precise focus\nof the program’s asset buy may be less critical than the broader fact that the central bank is\npurchasing long-duration securities, and that rates on all long-duration securities will be\nimpacted by the program. Lower long-term rates should stimulate demand for assets influenced\nby the cost of borrowing long – such as investments by businesses, and home and car purchases\nby consumers.\n[Slide 17] Another channel that LSAPs may influence involves conveying the likelihood\nthat short-term rates will remain low. While the Federal Reserve has used language referencing\n“an extended period” in the FOMC minutes for some time, the markets interpretation of that\nperiod is likely to be influenced by actions taken.\n[Slide 18] Indeed, as Figure 7 shows, prior to the LSAP program announcements the\nthree-year Treasury rate had been trading above 2 percent. Since the announcements, the threeyear Treasury rate has been below 2 percent – and more recently has been trading closer to the\nrate on shorter-term Treasuries. As of Wednesday of this week, the one-year Treasury was\ntrading at 0.22 percent, the two-year was trading at 0.37 percent, and the three-year was trading\nat 0.57 percent. This compression of rates is consistent with market participants anticipating that\nlow rates are likely to continue for quite some time. Of course, not only Treasury securities are\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ninfluenced by expectations of policy; rates on other securities of short to medium term are likely\nto be lower as well.\n[Slide 19] Another area that is potentially impacted by an LSAP is foreign exchange.\nThis is a mechanism that received significant attention at our earlier conference.\n[Slide 20] Since exchange rates are determined by a variety of policies, both here and\nabroad, the empirical relationship may be difficult to detect. This is particularly true for the\ndollar exchange rate, where the precautionary demand for dollars can cause large movements in\nthe exchange rate as investors look to park funds in dollars during periods of economic\nturbulence. Nonetheless, one might think that the exchange rate would be influenced by policies\nto reduce domestic interest rates as investors move funds to countries yielding a higher return.\nAs Figure 8 highlights, the relationship with the LSAP and exchange rates is not visually\ncompelling, but nonetheless this is a channel worth studying and better understanding.\n[Slide 21] Another potential channel involves bank lending. As large corporations issue\nlong-term debt at attractively low rates, they become less dependent on loans or lines of credits\nfrom banks. As larger firms move to capital markets for financing, it should free up bank\nbalance sheets to allow a focus on those firms that really depend on banks for financing. The\nstrength of this channel needs to be explored more thoroughly.\n\nConcluding Observations\n[Slide 22] This conference, more than 10 years after our earlier conference on the topic,\nhas benefitted from the additional experience that countries around the world have had, in the\ninterim, with monetary policy in a low inflation environment. I would summarize by saying that\nclearly, conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment is difficult – and particularly\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nso when that low inflation environment also includes wrenching financial difficulties and\nstubbornly high unemployment rates. At our earlier conference there was probably too little\nappreciation of the potential challenges, and too low a weight placed on how a low inflation\nenvironment could be hampered by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.\nWhile it may be too early to draw firm conclusions about monetary policy at the zero\nbound for short-term interest rates, I would like to draw some tentative conclusions.\n\n•\n\nFirst, a policy of gradually adjusting monetary and fiscal policy, as conducted in\nJapan after deflation first occurred, may not be as effective as an active policy\nresponse taken before deflation has become embedded in the economy. Of course, it\nshould depend on the given situation and incoming data.\n\n•\n\nSecond, while monetary policy may have difficulty fully offsetting a severe shock\nwhen the zero bound is hit, there are still important channels for monetary policy to\nuse to mitigate the negative shocks.\n\n•\n\nThird, it is not a coincidence that in Japan, the United States, and Europe these\neconomic problems have been encountered in conjunction with banking and financial\nmarket problems. Analysis of monetary policy with the zero bound needs to more\nrichly capture the aspects of the financial sector that are major contributors to\neconomic difficulties.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Saturday, October 16, 2010 at 8:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n•\n\nFinally, we all recognize that conducting unconventional monetary and fiscal policy\nat the zero bound requires political will. This of course must be factored into any\nanalysis of policy options.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of today’s discussion on this crucial topic.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe inflation rate was 2.1 percent in October 1999 as measured by the year over year change in the core CPI, and\n2.56 percent as measured by the overall CPI.\n\n2\n\nIn the discussion paper entitled “Flow and Stock Effects of Large-Scale Treasury Purchases,” Stefania D’Amico\nand Thomas B. King of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs note that “During the crisis of\n2008, policymakers took a number of extraordinary steps to improve the functioning of financial markets and\nstimulate the economy. Among the most important of these measures, in terms of both scale and prominence, were\nthe Federal Reserve’s purchases of large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market,\nconventionally known as the Large Scale Asset Purchase—or “LSAP”—programs. The LSAPs included debt\nobligations of the government-sponsored housing agencies, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by those\nagencies, and coupon securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and they collectively amounted to $1.7 trillion over a\nperiod of about 15 months—the single largest government intervention in financial-market history. Given the\nunprecedented size and nature of these programs and the speed with which they were proposed and implemented,\npolicymakers could have had, at best, only a very rough ex ante sense of their potential impact.”\n3\n\nSee for example “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” by Joseph Gagnon,\nMatthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack; Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 441,\nMarch 2010.\n\n11\n\n\fRevisiting Monetary Policy in a\nLow Inflation Environment\nEric S.

            "content": "Dividend Policy and Capital Retention: A\nSystemic “First Response”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n“Rethinking Central Banking” Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 10, 2010\n\n[Slide 1]\n\nThank you for inviting me to offer a few observations on some design and\nimplementation issues we all face with regard to macroprudential supervisory policies.*\nPerhaps a positive offshoot of the recent severe financial crisis is that it has galvanized\npolicymakers to expedite work on macroprudential supervision and regulation. The sense of\nurgency has helped regulators make significant progress on increasing bank capital buffers and\nhas sharpened the focus on liquidity risk. These efforts are important, and should improve the\nstrength and resiliency of the financial system when fully implemented.\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f[Slide 2]\n\nOver the last year I have sometimes made a comparison between new and needed\nfinancial regulations and the regulations developed in the 1800s to prevent the “great fires” that\nhad plagued many major cities. One thing that greatly reduced the risk of such fires was the\ndevelopment and enforcement of tough new building codes. This meant using building materials\nthat were less flammable, and raising structures that made it far less likely that a building would\ncatch fire – or that would suppress the spread of a fire, should it nonetheless occur. In many\nrespects I see enhanced capital and liquidity rules as equivalent changes in our financial system,\nwhich should make financial institutions far less susceptible to “financial firestorms.”\nAnother aspect of the solution to great fires was the move to hiring professional fire\nfighters with adequate equipment and sufficient access to water to quickly respond to a fire. This\nreduced the risk that if a fire occurred, it would spread in some catastrophic way.\nThe importance of response time is highlighted in the questions that get asked when you\ntake out fire insurance on your house. They ask how close you are to the nearest fire station, and\nhow close you are to a fire hydrant. The questions are important because the answers impact the\nextent of the damage a fire can cause. They also impact the likelihood that a fire at a neighbor’s\nhouse could spread and impact your home.\nResponse time is also critically important in financial regulation and in limiting financial\ndamage. Today I am going to briefly discuss one type of financial “first response” – the ability\nto retain capital in the banking system by cutting bank dividends when problems first emerge.\nGiven the evidence in the data, I will highlight the fact that in relation to dividends, bank\nmanagement and supervisors responded quite slowly in the United States during the financial\ncrisis. I will suggest that macroprudential supervision should include early detection of\nproblems, and in a troubled banking system the reduction of dividends to retain capital.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Timing of Dividend Reductions\n\n[Slide 3]\n\nFigure 1 shows that in August 2007, as the financial crisis emerged, banks became\nwilling to lend to each other at one-month maturity only at rates dramatically different from the\nprevious year. While the increase in August 2007 looks a bit less spectacular than the spike that\nfollowed the events of the fall of 2008, it was nonetheless a dramatic change. The economic\nimplications of emerging financial problems contributed to the significant response in monetary\npolicy.\n\n[Slide 4]\n\nBut as Figure 2 highlights, the 2007 events did not lead to similarly significant changes\nin supervisory policy. The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking\norganizations (the 19 SCAPi participants and others) actually increased in the fourth quarter of\n2007, and did not show dramatic reductions until after the financial crisis hit a crescendo in the\nfall of 2008.\n\n[Slide 5]\n\nFigure 3 puts in perspective the cumulative cash dividends of the largest banks by\ncomparing them to the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funds they received.\n\n[Slide 6]\n\nThis suggests that if dividends had been halted at the SCAP banks once the LIBOR rate\nrose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained as capital. This represents close to 50 percent\nof the CPP funds used to recapitalize these banks in the fall of 2008. Clearly a proactive\napproach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency\ninfusion of public funds.\n\n3\n\n\fFinancial Indicators of Emerging Problems\n\nRegulatory dividend policy was focused on the ability of banks to pay dividends out of\nearnings. However, earnings declines occurred later than the financial market responses to\nemerging problems. In addition, banks’ management and boards of directors rarely are proactive\nin reducing dividends, because of concerns that it will signal that they are experiencing more\nsevere financial problems than their peers. With earnings somewhat slow to react to emerging\nproblems, and boards reluctant to signal problems, most of the large banks were very slow to\nreact to the crisis with reduced dividends.\n\n[Slide 7]\n\nSimilarly, banks’ supervisory ratings were also slow to react, as shown in Figure 4. The\nmeasure of the share of assets in so-called “problem” banksii – the blue line – responds only with\na delay. A similar pattern emerges if one looks at the percentage of bank assets in the three\nlowest supervisory ratings (CAMELS ratings of 3, 4, or 5), although it captures a much higher\npercentage of total bank assets. In contrast, the credit default swap spread for the four largest\nU.S. banking organizations – the green line – began to climb in the fall of 2007 and continued to\nclimb throughout 2008 and into 2009. I should note that we use the four largest banks simply\nbecause of the availability of historical credit default swap data, but our modeling suggests this is\nrepresentative for the largest banks more generally.\n\n[Slide 8]\n\nFigure 5 shows that a similar pattern emerges if one uses the market capitalization\nrelative to assets of the four largest banking organizations.iii Like the credit default swaps, the\nmeasure (the green line) began to decline significantly in the fall of 2007 and continued to\ndecline through 2008 and into 2009. Again this financial indicator of bank health moved far\nmore quickly than regulatory ratings (see the blue line) or dividend reductions.\n\n4\n\n\f[Slide 9]\n\nFigure 6 highlights another issue – that as financial markets took a bleaker view of\nbanks’ financial prospects (in the top chart), banks had begun to tighten credit standards (in the\nbottom chart). By the end of 2007, credit standards had tightened substantially, relative to where\nthey were in the beginning of that year. Banks seek to maintain reasonable capital-to-assets\nratios and loans are, of course, assets for banks. If capital is eventually reduced due to loan\nwrite-downs, and banks reduce lending to maintain capital-to-asset ratios, the “collateral\ndamage” to those who would like to borrow from “supply-constrained” banking institutions can\nimpose a significant cost to the economy more broadly. So the impact of only slowly reducing\ndividends, rather than retaining capital in the banking system, extends well beyond losses to\nstockholders and potentially taxpayers.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\n[Slide 10]\n\nEven from the perspective of microprudential supervision, more proactive dividend\nreduction would have ameliorated some of the costs of the financial crisis. Rather than basing\nregulatory dividend policy on accounting constructs that tend to be slow moving and backward\nlooking, regulatory policy should prompt supervisors to look forward and thus more proactively\nseek reductions in dividends in appropriate circumstances. In particular, given the financialmarket signals of impending problems that I have highlighted today, I believe that supervisors\nneed in such circumstances to be more proactive in seeking capital retention through reduced\ndividends at banking organizations.\n\n[Slide 11]\n\nOf course, signaling problems can make it difficult for supervisors to mandate reductions\nat individual institutions. When a wide variety of indicators suggest potential problems in the\nbanking sector, signaling problems could be avoided if, hypothetically, all banks were required\n\n5\n\n\fto reduce dividends – or all banks with outsized exposures. For example, banks with large real\nestate exposures in loans and securities could in such a situation be required to reduce dividends\nbefore accounting losses were realized. Such a policy might very well reduce the creditavailability problems that have unfortunately been a hallmark of this financial crisis.\nIn retrospect, empirical analysis suggests that bank management and supervisors had an\nopportunity to retain capital once problems became identifiable, but before the full extent of the\ncrisis emerged in the fall of 2008. In the spirit of learning and applying lessons, one must\nconsider whether this dynamic could repeat itself – or indeed is repeating itself. For example, in\nsome parts of the world today, sovereign risk exposure seems problematic and elevated credit\ndefault swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing\nto pay dividends.\nIn sum, I suggest that more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer\nexposure to the banking sector, but also insulate the broader economy from the sorts of loansupply shocks that can provide significant headwinds to an economic recovery.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\ni\n\nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program\n\nii\n\nProblem banks, as defined by the FDIC, are banks with a CAMELS rating of 4 or 5. The FDIC publishes the\naggregate number and assets of problem banks each quarter.\niii\n\nAgain, we use the four largest banks simply because of the availability of historical credit default swap data used\nin Figure 4, the companion chart to Figure 5. But the finding is representative for the largest banks more generally.\n\n6\n\n\fPotential Early Response\n Analogy to fire insurance\n\n\n\n\nHow close are you to fire station?\nHow close are you to a fire hydrant?\nResponse time matters – to homeowner but\nalso to the neighborhood\n\n Dividend policy\n\n\nHow quickly did bank management and\nsupervisors respond to the crisis?\n\n\fFigure 1\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 2005 - September 2010\n\nBasis Points\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nJan-2005 Jul-2005 Jan-2006 Jul-2006 Jan-2007 Jul-2007 Jan-2008 Jul-2008 Jan-2009 Jul-2009 Jan-2010 Jul-2010\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 2\nCash Dividends Declared on Common Stock\nby Largest Banking Organizations\n2007:Q3 - 2010:Q1\n\nBillions of Dollars\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n2007:Q3\n\n2007:Q4\n\n2008:Q1\n\n2008:Q2\n\n2008:Q3\n\n2008:Q4\n\n2009:Q1\n\n2009:Q2\n\n2009:Q3\n\n2009:Q4\n\n2010:Q1\n\nNote: Includes the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) Participants and Wachovia and Washington Mutual\nSource: Company Financial Statements, Bloomberg\n\n\fFigure 3\nCumulative Cash Dividends and Capital Purchase\nProgram Funds Received\n2007:Q3 - 2010:Q1\n\nBillions of Dollars\n180\n160\n\nCPP Funds Received\n\n140\n120\n100\n80\n\nCumulative Cash Dividends on Common Stock\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n2007:Q3 2007:Q4 2008:Q1 2008:Q2 2008:Q3 2008:Q4 2009:Q1 2009:Q2 2009:Q3 2009:Q4 2010:Q1\n\nCPP Funds Received\n\nNote: Includes the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) Participants and Wachovia and Washington Mutual\nSource: Company Financial Statements, Bloomberg, US Treasury\n\n\fObservations\n If dividends had been stopped at the SCAP\nbanks once the LIBOR rate rose, nearly $80\nbillion would have been retained\n This was close to 50% of the CPP funds\nused to recapitalize these banks in the fall\nof 2008\n Pro-active dividend retention strategies\ncould have substantially reduced the need\nfor public funds\n\n\fFigure 4\nAverage of CDS Spreads of Four Largest Banking\nOrganizations and Share of Assets in Problem Banks\n2005:Q1 - 2010:Q2\n\nPercent of Bank Assets\n3.6\n\nBasis Points\n300\n250\n\n3.0\nCDS Spread (Right Scale)\n\n2.4\n\n200\n150\n\n1.8\n1.2\n\nShare of Assets in\nProblem Banks\n(Left Scale)\n\n0.6\n\n100\n50\n0\n\n0.0\n05:Q1\n\n05:Q3\n\n06:Q1\n\n06:Q3\n\n07:Q1\n\n07:Q3\n\n08:Q1\n\n08:Q3\n\n09:Q1\n\n09:Q3\n\n10:Q1\n\nThe CAMELS rating is a highly confidential supervisory rating which assesses six components of a bank's condition: capital\nadequacy (C), asset quality (A), management (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity to market risk (S).

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Forecasters Club of New York\nSeptember 29, 2010\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today at the Forecaster’s Club.*\nWorking at the Fed over the last 25 years has given me a healthy regard for the challenges\nyou face every day as you attempt to divine the future path of the economy. Even during the\nbest of times it is not easy, but this has been a particularly challenging time in forecasting. It\nhas proven to be very difficult to incorporate the effects of the financial system into models of\nthe economy – in part because the financial sector may have a significant impact on economic\nforecasts only during the rare occasions when the sector is badly disrupted.\nWhile financial markets and financial institutions are now in far better shape than two\nyears ago, the collateral damage on the economy from the financial shocks has been severe.\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board\nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe damage has, unfortunately, followed the pattern established in the aftermath of previous\nsignificant financial disruptions, which tend to cause an extended period of subpar economic\ngrowth.1\nThese days, as in past recoveries, it is not uncommon to hear some observers say that\nthere is little that policymakers can or should do. This is not my perspective, and I want to\nuse this opportunity to share some of the analytical and empirical underpinnings for my\nviews.\nWhile these topics are getting a lot of attention of late – understandably – many of us\nhave been researching them for some time. And I would just like to reiterate that I take an\nempirical, data-driven approach to policymaking responsibilities – a fact I believe my talk\ntoday will demonstrate.\nWhile certainly the economic problems we are facing are daunting, I do not see them\nas insurmountable. In fact, although the economy is far from where we would like it to be, we\nare in a far better place than we were two years ago, when financial markets and economic\nactivity were in the process of “seizing up.” The stock market is well off its lows, interest\nspreads have narrowed, and the economy has had four quarters of positive, if anemic, growth.\nAnd it was policy – monetary policy and fiscal policy, and to some degree supervisory\npolicy – that played a critical role in the improvements we have seen over the past two years.\nWe have a long way to go, but it would have been much longer but for a number of parties\nmaking difficult but appropriate policy decisions.\nHowever, while we have seen positive growth over the past year, it has been slow.\nWe have seen some increases in employment, but there has not been any significant reduction\nin the high percentage of workers who are unemployed. And, while financial market\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nconditions have improved dramatically, credit availability remains an issue for many\nindividuals and businesses. In short, policymaking has been effective at stabilizing the\neconomy, but the recovery remains far too weak to restore what we consider full employment\nwith the speed I would like to see.\nToday I would like to touch on a number of issues, including some of the recently\nhypothesized impediments to a more robust recovery. I would also like to explore some of\nthe options for generating a more robust recovery – options that policymakers need to\nconsider and debate, thoughtfully and analytically, as we go forward.\nAllow me to preview my punch line. I’ve called this talk “How Should Monetary\nPolicy Respond to a Slow Recovery?” My answer to that question is: vigorously, creatively,\nthoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal. And we do have\noptions, despite having pushed short-term rates to the zero lower bound.\n\nDislocations in the Labor Market?\nSome hypothesize that a more robust recovery is impeded by dislocations in the labor\nmarket. Indeed, history shows that even with a relatively mild recession there can be\nsignificant dislocations. The 2001 recession provides a good example. As Figure 1 shows,\ninformation technology and manufacturing were two industries that saw significant declines\nin employment in that downturn. The end of the “dot-com” euphoria and structural shifts in\nthe manufacturing sector caused those two industries to be disproportionately affected, while\nwe had only modest declines in the cyclical construction industry, and increases in\nemployment in several industries. Similarly, the 1990 recession had a decline in employment\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof more than 5 percent in only the construction industry, when overbuilding in several regions\nof the country led to a significant readjustment in construction-industry employment.\nIn fact, in each of the three previous recessions there was a decline of 5 percent or\nmore in no more than two industry categories – as the figure shows – with many industries\nexperiencing little or no net job loss over the course of the recession. Structural shifts across\nindustries are not uncommon in recessions – and also, some structural dislocation seems\ninevitable as it will always take some time for capital and labor to flow to those industries\nwith the greatest opportunities.\nIn rather stark contrast, the most recent recession is far less a reflection of dislocation\nin a few industries but rather reflects a general decline in almost all industries. As the chart\non the far right shows, in this recession there has been a peak to trough loss of employment of\n5 percent or greater in construction, manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade,\ntransportation, information technology, financial activities, and professional and business\nservices. To me, this does not suggest that the driver is structural change in the economy\nincreasing job mismatches – although no doubt some of that exists – but instead I see here a\nwidespread decline in demand across most industries.\nNot surprisingly, given this far-reaching decline in labor demand, job vacancies are\nremarkably low. Not only are they low, but they are also well below the experience in most\nrecent recessions, making small movements in job-vacancy rates particularly difficult to\ninterpret. For example, economists and forecasters are estimating Beveridge curves (plotting\nthe relationship between job vacancies and unemployment)2 well outside historical\nexperience, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about recent movements.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 2 highlights that job mismatches are not the primary problem. The bottom\nchart shows that the percentage of small businesses with one or more hard-to-fill jobs open is\nnear the low point for the series over nearly 25 years. According to survey data, businesses\nare having no problem finding skilled workers for what were considered hard-to-fill\nvacancies. This is consistent with my ongoing discussions with representatives of businesses,\nwho generally report no difficulty finding qualified workers even for quite specialized\npositions.\nHowever, as the top chart on the figure shows, most small businesses are not\nexpecting to increase employment. When I talk with representatives of businesses, the\nprimary reason they give for this is they are not seeing sufficient demand for their products.\nIf they were confident that demand would pick up, they would – and easily could – hire\nadditional workers.\n\nBalance Sheet Adjustments?\nAnother impediment to a more robust recovery could well be balance sheet\nadjustments by financial and nonfinancial firms, and households. To explore this, let’s\nexamine this cycle in some more detail. Figure 3 splits the time since the onset of the\nrecession into three periods:\n•\n\nThe first period runs from the beginning of the recession in December 2007\nthrough August 2008. Up to that point, the recession looked quite similar in depth\nand duration to previous recessions. The only sector with a very substantial\ndecline in employment was the construction industry.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n•\n\nThe second period is from August 2008 through June 2009. After the large\nfinancial shocks that occurred in September and October of 2008, there were large\nand widespread declines in employment across a wide variety of industries. Both\nthe disruption of credit and concerns that we could see an extremely severe\ncontraction caused most businesses to become far more cautious.\n\n•\n\nThe final period, from June 2009 to the present, encompasses the recovery to date.\nThis recovery has been quite slow, with continued sharp declines in construction\nactivity. In fact, the first year of the recovery has an employment pattern similar to\nshallow recessions, indicating just how weak the recovery has been so far.\n\nMost forecasts of employment and unemployment during this period did not anticipate\nthe severe turn of events. Figure 4 provides the Blue Chip forecast for unemployment at the\nbeginning of the first two periods in the charts we just saw – and the actual unemployment\nexperience. In December 2007, few saw cause for great alarm. The expectation was that\nunemployment would remain stable near 5 percent, when in fact what actually happened was\na marked increase in the unemployment rate.\nIn part, the forecasts were off because many of the financial disruptions that were\nalready evident were not well captured in econometric models. Also, recessions are\nnotoriously difficult to predict, and most models struggle to capture turning points.\nThe second chart on Figure 4 shows that even in August 2008, many forecasts did not\npredict great difficulties. For the most part, the unemployment rate was expected to remain\nnear 6 percent, when in reality it rose to over 9 percent. Thus, one month before the worst of\nthe financial crisis emerged, there was little expectation of a significant financial shock or the\nmajor impact that it would have on the overall economy.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFortunately, the Federal Reserve had already begun to ease – and continued to ease\nquite dramatically – despite most forecasts predicting a more benign outcome. We had\nalready reduced the federal funds rate very substantially by August, and as a result of the\nfinancial crisis eventually pushed the federal funds rate essentially to its lower bound of zero.\nThus, during much of this period monetary policy was quite proactive. While it could not\noffset the effects of the severe problems emerging in the economy, the policy stance was more\nresponsive than if it had been in synch with most private forecasts at the time. This\npolicymaking was key to avoiding far worse outcomes.\nFigure 5 looks at the forecasts for unemployment at the end of this year over the span\nof time I referred to as the recovery period. At the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate\nwas 9.7 percent. As the figure shows, there has been a consistent view that the recovery\nwould be weak and make only limited progress on reducing unemployment. While through\nApril the forecasts were getting more optimistic about labor market trends, since then\nforecasters have been raising their forecasts for unemployment. Regrettably, I have to concur\nwith the view expressed in these forecasts – that the unemployment rate is likely to be very\nclose to the very elevated level at the beginning of the year.\nFigure 6 provides some context for that pessimism. While two of the past four\nquarters had growth (in blue) above estimates of potential, the expansion in what we call\n“final sales” (in red) has been below potential. Since by definition the difference between\nGDP and final sales reflects inventories, we need final sales to pick up – especially as\ntemporary stimulus from inventories, and government, subsides. Unfortunately, there is little\nevidence in the data of that happening, with growth in the second half of 2010 likely to be in\nthe vicinity of 2 percent.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe bottom graph on Figure 6 shows the change in the employment-to-population\nratio (in green). While there was employment growth in the first half of 2010, it has only\nresulted in a slight improvement in the employment-to-population ratio.\nWith that background, let me note that one challenge in getting the economy to grow\nfaster has been the desire of households and businesses to essentially “rebuild” their balance\nsheets in the wake of this so-called “Great Recession.” Figure 7 highlights that the personal\nsavings rate has risen, and Figure 8 shows that households have increased their holdings of\ncash and securities. While rebuilding wealth and remaining more liquid are natural reactions\nto recent conditions – and positive in a long-term sense – the fact is they portend rather\nmodest increases in consumption in the near term, until consumers become more confident\nabout their prospects.\nFigure 9 highlight that businesses and banks have also been increasing their holdings\nof cash and securities. While this is natural, such behavior will likely keep growth in business\nfixed investment rather restrained.\n\nThe Policy Response\nSo how should monetary policy react to a very anemic recovery? The usual monetary\npolicy response to slow growth in nominal GDP would be to continue reducing the federal\nfunds rate, and during the past two slow recoveries that is what the Federal Reserve did. As I\nhave already highlighted, by central bank standards we moved rather quickly to recognize the\nseverity of the problem in this downturn, and responded with monetary accommodation.\nHowever, since the end of 2008 the federal funds rate has been bounded by zero, which has\neliminated the ability to decrease short-term interest rates.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nA simple Taylor Rule calculation, shown in Figure 10, relates movements in the\nfederal funds rate to deviations in inflation and unemployment from their targets. The far\nright section of the chart highlights that given the very low level of inflation and the very high\nlevel of the unemployment rate, the Fed would have continued to reduce the funds rate over\nthe past two years, but for the zero lower bound.\nConstrained by the zero bound, the Federal Reserve utilized less conventional policies\n– as shown in Figure 11. Most of these approaches had never been tried in the United States\nprior to the crisis. New policies outside of historical experience necessarily involve some\nuncertainty about their impact. We were fortunate that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal\nOpen Market Committee had the courage to undertake unconventional policies in the “teeth”\nof a crisis. It is easy – and I dare say commonplace – to underestimate the economic\ndisruption that would likely have arisen if we at the Fed had stuck to our ”comfort zone.”\nIt is easy with hindsight to see the financial meltdown as an historic economic crisis,\none that galvanized officials to push out the boundaries of policymaking and take action. But\nin my view, current economic conditions – an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish\ngrowth, and undesirably low inflation – together constitute a serious economic problem.\nWhile it’s clear to everyone why a high unemployment rate is a problem, one of the reasons\nwe worry about a too-low rate of inflation is that the closer to zero the inflation rate gets, the\ngreater the risk it could fall into a harmful deflation.\nAs I said earlier, we do have options, despite having pushed short-term rates to the\nzero lower bound. One of the challenges is that with unconventional policies, costs can be\napparent but benefits more indirect, and harder to track.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases – primarily purchases of mortgagebacked securities – arguably had multiple effects, including maintaining market function in\nthe mortgage markets. But in my view their primary impact on the economy was achieved by\nreducing mortgage rates. Rates had been around 6 percent prior to the change in policy, and\nmoved closer to 5 percent as our purchases began to accumulate, as shown in Figure 12. It\nalso appears that by “removing duration” from the market, other long-term rates were also\nreduced in response to our purchases.\nOf course, none of this is easy or without complications. There are concerns about\nthings like creating distortions in credit allocation, complicating exit strategies when they\nbecome appropriate, and exposing the Federal Reserve to interest-rate risk. Those issues are\nimportant to recognize, and to work to mitigate. At the same time, we cannot take lightly how\nfar off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be.\nNow I’d like to make a few observations on Fed purchases of Treasury securities.\nFirst, the positives: Purchases of long-term Treasury securities are likely to push down\nlong-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, but also are likely to reduce rates on other longterm securities. Some have argued that it would be difficult to reduce Treasury rates further,\nbut Figure 13 highlights, importantly, that U.S. Treasury rates are still well above the zero\nbound, roughly equivalent to rates in Germany, and well above long-term rates in Japan.\nNow some concerns: While purchases of Treasury securities have the advantage of not\ndirectly “allocating credit” to a particular industry, they have the disadvantage of only\nindirectly affecting the private borrowing rates that more directly affect private investment\nspending. In addition, Treasury purchases raise for some a concern that the Fed intends to\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmonetize the federal debt, using monetary policy to accommodate the financing of fiscal\npolicy. I can assure you that we have no desire or intention whatsoever to do so.\nWhile lower long-term rates are likely the primary channel through which asset\npurchases would influence the economy, purchases of Treasury or mortgage-backed securities\nalso expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and increase the amount of reserves in the\nfinancial system. This expansion of reserves might serve as an effective signal that highlights\nthe determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationary pressures.\nCertainly, views on securities purchases differ within the ranks of policymakers and\nall manner of observers. I would just reiterate that it is important to keep firmly in mind the\ngoal of such purchases: to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates to a\nlevel that is more consistent with where they would be, were we able to further reduce the\nfederal funds rate.\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile the economy is growing, it is currently growing too slowly to significantly\nreduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures created by the high degree of\nslack in the economy. While fiscal policies may be the most effective way to stimulate the\neconomy when short-term interest rates approach the zero bound, unconventional monetary\npolicies provide additional policy options. Of course, policymakers need to carefully weigh\nthe benefits and costs of unconventional monetary policy – some of which I have tried to\nshare with you today. Yet all in all, my firm view is that it is important that policymakers be\nopen to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate\nlevel of inflation, within a reasonable time frame. Thank you.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, September 29, 2010 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee for example the work of Carmen M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve\nConference on REO and Vacant Property\nStrategies for Neighborhood Stabilization\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 2, 2010\n\n[Slide 1]\n\nI’m very happy to be here today, to take part in a conference on topics of such importance.\nHousing has played a central role in the financial crisis and the subsequent economic\ndifficulties that we have been experiencing now for more than three years. *\n\nThis conference brings together people from around the country who have been on the front\nlines looking for solutions to mitigate the personal and societal costs of mounting\nforeclosures, and the buildup of REO properties. By gathering together, we can learn from\neach other’s successes – and also from each other’s well-intentioned failures.\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board\nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI expect we will learn that a single solution may not work in all regions of the country. What\nseems promising in Cleveland and in other cities in the northern Midwest may not be the best\nsolution for New England, or for Southern California. The reason, I suspect, is that the effects\nof the housing and financial crisis on any community depend, importantly, on the attributes of\nthe community. For example, how susceptible is the population to extended spells of\nunemployment or other income disruptions? How healthy was the local economy and\nindustry before the crisis? And how well-equipped are local nonprofit and governmental\ninstitutions – and civic leaders – to respond to the fallout from the crisis?\n\n[Slide 2]\n\nMy comments today will focus on the foreclosure and REO problem in my region – New\nEngland. In particular, I want to ask how best to understand the problem: Is it a housing\nproblem that affects all communities similarly? Or is it a foreclosure and REO problem that\naffects all communities in a similar way? Or is the problem better understood as a crisis that\nis reflected differently in each community, and thus requires solutions that are very likely to\ndiffer, across communities?\n\nI’ll just take a moment to preview my remarks. I will first show that New England locations,\ndefined by zip codes, with a high concentration of REO properties have (not surprisingly)\nincurred larger declines in home prices than zip codes with lower REO concentrations. I will\nthen highlight that many of these same communities were areas that faced challenges even\nbefore the foreclosure crisis – challenges that made these communities more likely to suffer\ndisproportionately the consequences of the crisis. 1\n\nI will then touch briefly on research and policy implications. In particular, do we need more\nholistic approaches to addressing this crisis? Should there be more state and federal revenue\nsharing focused on providing flexible funds to the communities most affected? My answer to\nboth of these questions is a yes. But I would also argue that we need to not only explore\nalternative solutions, but also do a much better job of establishing which solutions work – and\nthen try to replicate effective solutions on a larger scale.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHow Should the Foreclosure Problem Be Framed?\n\n[Slide 3]\n\nFinding the right solution requires asking the right question. So I want to begin by asking,\nwhat is the question we are trying to answer?\n\nTo that end I suggest we do a little exercise. We might gain some insight into how the\nattendees at this conference are framing the question by looking at the non-profit\norganizations on the program. What is their key focus? If we assume the name of an\norganization was chosen to indicate its central mission, by noting the keyword in the name we\nmay learn something about their primary focus. On the agenda for this conference, five nonprofit organizations have “community” or “neighborhood” in their names; two have\n“housing”; and one has “foreclosure” or “REO.” Most of you are no doubt focusing on rising\nforeclosures and REO properties, but it seems that you see these through the “lens” of\ncommunity. However, it is less clear that public policies have been similarly aligned.\n\n[Slide 4]\n\nTo help illustrate why the framing of a problem is important, we should consider what the\nfocus might be if we assume different primary objectives.\n•\n\nIf one looks at the problem as primarily a foreclosure and REO problem rooted in the\nhousing bubble, the solutions will tend to emphasize mitigating the foreclosure\nproblem or accelerating the disposition of REO properties. Some will also advocate\nfor a reconsideration of the legal system’s approach to personal bankruptcy and\nforeclosure.\n\n•\n\nIf, instead, one views the problem as being primarily a housing problem, you might\naddress the problem differently. You might focus on solutions that result in\nsustainable home ownership. For example, what should be the minimum down\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npayment on a house, and what financing approaches would results in sustainable home\nownership? The solutions to this sort of a problem might be focusing on financial\neducation, addressing predatory home financing, and redefining appropriate\nunderwriting standards. The availability of affordable rental housing might also be a\nfocus.\n\n•\n\nIf the problem is seen through the lens of community, however, foreclosure may be\nviewed as a symptom of broader problems affecting neighborhoods – such as high\nconcentrations of unemployment, elevated crime rates, and poor code enforcement.\nLet me be clear; I am not saying that “the community is the problem,” but rather that,\nin this view, different communities will experience problems differently because of\ntheir different characteristics, requiring different solutions in many cases. The public\npolicy solution for this problem may be to have more general revenues available for\nnon-profits and local governments to address the problem in a more holistic fashion.\n\n[Slide 5]\n\nClearly there are elements of all three in the current crisis. This is a foreclosure problem.\nThis is a housing problem. This is a community problem. However, as I just illustrated, the\nsolutions may be somewhat different, depending on how one frames the problem. So, we\nshould ask, do we have the right balance as we think about the best way to address a serious –\nand I would argue multifaceted – public policy problem? My own view is that too little focus\nhas been on community problems because the focus has been more targeted to housing and\nforeclosures.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEvidence from New England\n\n[Slide 6]\n\nAs we consider these questions, I’d like to share with you some evidence from New England\n– and in particular Greater Boston.\n\n[Slide 7]\n\nThe first chart provides REO per square mile in three New England states by zip code and\ncompares that with the change in the median housing sales price from 2005 to 2008 for the\nsame zip code. As you can see in the chart, in areas with a lower concentration of REO there\nis not a strong correlation with changes in median sales price. However, as the concentration\nof REO increases there is a much stronger correlation with median sales price change. Zip\ncodes with higher concentrations of REO tend to have seen larger declines in median sales\nprice.\n\nLet me be quick to acknowledge the open question of causality. We are doing more statistical\nwork to try to understand the causality in the REO-concentration and house-price relationship.\nThat work needs to also control for factors such as population density.\n\n[Slide 8]\n\nThe next figure highlights that high concentrations of REO are not the only problem afflicting\nthose communities. Zip codes with four or more REOs per square mile also have higher\nproperty crime rates, higher rates of low birth-weight babies, higher unemployment rates, and\nweaker small business activity. Note that all these charts are for the time period that generally\nprecedes the foreclosure crisis, so these communities were already challenged.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n[Slide 9]\n\nIndeed, the next figure highlights that children in these communities were being impacted\neven before the dramatic increase in foreclosures. Communities that would eventually have\nfour or more REO properties per square mile had higher high school drop-out rates and higher\nfailures in statewide math tests.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that dramatic increases in foreclosure rates would not exacerbate these\nproblems. A foreclosure is likely to mean not only a loss of home, but also a disruption in\nwhere, or whether, kids are in school. Since foreclosure is often related to unemployment,\nmarital stress, or physical ailments, the foreclosure is likely to make it difficult for even the\nmost determined student to excel. The impact of the foreclosure crisis on children is\nsomething we are trying to better understand at the Boston Fed.\n\nThe bottom chart on slide 9 highlights that these communities have a large gap between their\nmunicipal service needs and their ability to raise revenues to pay for those needs (…the socalled “fiscal gap”). A recent study at the Boston Fed highlights that non-school revenue\nsharing in Massachusetts is not well aligned with communities’ fiscal gaps. 2 Changes in\nrevenue sharing are critical to helping those communities address their problems. Potentially,\na federal revenue sharing program at the national level that focuses on these communities\ncould help. These funds could be provided in a flexible way so they could target those areas\nof most importance – since local governments may be in a better position to determine if the\nfunds should be directed to more teachers, more code enforcement, more police, or more\nassistance to non-profit organizations that are making a difference in their communities.\n\n[Slide 10]\n\nNow, since a picture is worth a thousand words, I would like to show you some maps that\ndemonstrate how clusters of REO are associated with a host of other community problems.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe next five figures [Slides 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] show the community patterns in the data.\nThose communities with very high REO per square mile also fare poorly in many other\ndimensions. Many communities are performing poorly in all the criteria illustrated in the\nfigures. If these are community problems, we may need to search for community solutions.\n\nImplications for Research and Policy\n\n[Slide 16]\n\nThe patterns in these data imply a need for more holistic approaches to the problem. This is\nnot a one-size-fits-all foreclosure or housing problem; these are community problems. Of\ncourse, I am showing you examples from New England and one needs to examine how\nsimilar or dissimilar the patterns are in other regions.\n\nBut it seems, in sum, that communities with some of these challenging attributes are likely to\nexperience higher rates of foreclosure and REO. And the same communities experience\ngreater hardships in the face of rising foreclosures and REO.\n\nRather than treating the symptom – the high REO problem – we need to better understand\nhow to resolve the more general problems in communities that lead to higher concentrations\nof REOs and exacerbate the effects of high REOs. However, the challenge of finding holistic\nsolutions is significant, and longstanding.\n\nI am encouraging Boston Fed staff to work to better understand how foreclosures and REO\ncan exacerbate problems in troubled communities – and to look for data that can better\ndetermine which solutions work, under which circumstances. For example, we have been\nexamining the issues and barriers keeping the city of Springfield, Massachusetts from\nprosperity, with an eye to assisting Springfield and also sharing the lessons more broadly. As\npart of that work we have examined the factors that have helped other similar cities around\nthe country achieve a greater degree of resurgence. 3\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 9:20 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI am particularly encouraging my staff to look at how foreclosures affect children. While not\nresponsible for the foreclosure problem, children may be affected by its consequences for\nyears to come, if it prevents them from meeting their potential in school and eventually in the\nlabor force.\n\n[Slide 17]\n\nWhile more research needs to be done on the communities, and on which solutions work, we\nshould also reflect on how we are spending our public policy dollars. Are they appropriately\nbalanced to the problems of housing, foreclosure, and community need? If a more holistic\napproach is needed, states and the federal government may need to examine the most effective\nand efficient way to address the broader problems in these communities, including potentially\nlooking at revenue sharing that provides a flexible way to address the fiscal gap faced by\nmany of our hard-pressed communities.\n\nThank you. I believe we are now proceeding to the next session on the conference agenda.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSince New England housing prices were less variable than those in other regions, its foreclosure problems may\nbe slanted towards areas with secular problems.\n\n2\n\nSee “Does Springfield Receive Its Fair Share of Municipal Aid?

I appreciate your warm welcome, and your\ninvitation to join the long and distinguished line of individuals who have addressed the\nMoney Marketeers over the decades. *\n\nI have always taken some delight in Yogi Berra quotes.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nSox came to New York. Alas, in the early going this season it is not the Yankees that\nseem confused.\n\nYogi Berra was not only a great catcher and manager, but also an astute observer of the\nobvious. If he were to summarize this talk he might suggest a title like “Knowing Your\nDestination is a Good Start in Getting Where You Are Going” or some other derivation\nof what I believe is his actual quote: “You've got to be very careful if you don't know\nwhere you are going because you might not get there.”\n\nWhen setting monetary policy, it is very important to have a clear idea of where you want\nthe economy to go. And fortunately, there is now much more transparency about the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) expected destination, because the FOMC\nreleases its long-term projections for inflation and unemployment. Unfortunately,\nhowever, actually reaching our desired destination will prove challenging and involve\nchoices, as I will discuss this evening.\n\nAt our January meeting, the central tendency of the FOMC members’ long-run\nprojections for unemployment was 5.0 to 5.2 percent, and for inflation (measured by the\npersonal consumption expenditures price index or PCE) was 1.7 to 2.0 percent. At\npresent, both unemployment and inflation diverge significantly from these longer-term\ngoals, with the March unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and core PCE inflation over the\npast year at 1.3 percent. In such circumstances, one might think that the current path of\nmonetary policy would be particularly straightforward.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUnfortunately, just knowing your destination doesn’t get you there. To reach your\ndestination you need to know how you want to get there. If I plug a destination into my\nnew GPS device, it asks whether I want the quickest route, or the geographically shortest\nroute, or a route that meets some other criteria. The quickest route is likely to involve\nhighways, but may cover more miles. The shortest route may take side roads that reduce\ndistance and save gas, but take substantially more time. And, of course, you may run into\ntraffic or construction that forces you to adapt your route.\n\nWhen setting monetary policy there may be a variety of paths you can take to reach the\ndestination. For instance, aggressive pursuit of accommodative monetary policy by the\nFed and stimulative fiscal policy by Congress and the Administration might get us more\nquickly to our desired destination – but could enlarge the deficit or risk igniting inflation\nexpectations. Alternatively, aggressive pursuit of less accommodative policies – that is,\nremoving monetary and fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later – could result in a more\nextended period of underutilized resources; or worse, significantly increase the length of\nthe journey to our ultimate destination.\n\nRight now, we are far from our destination, and the rest of my remarks will focus on\nselecting among the alternate routes to our objective.\n\nThe economy is currently beginning to recover from what many are calling the Great\nRecession. While real GDP began to increase in the third quarter of last year, growth so\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfar has been insufficient to improve conditions much in the labor markets. This\nunfortunate reality can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the employment-to-population\nratio over the past 30 years with the shading representing recessions. The decline of\nabout five percentage points in the employment-to-population ratio in this recession is\nstriking, as many workers have either become unemployed or dropped out of the work\nforce.\n\nWhile it is not uncommon for the employment-to-population ratio to decline in a\nrecession, Figure 2 shows how dramatic the decline has been in this recession, compared\nwith previous ones. 1 The loss of jobs has been particularly acute in construction and\nmanufacturing. The severity of the job losses in these male-dominated industries is one\nof the reasons that males in some age groups have experienced such a significant decline\nin their employment-to-population ratio, as shown in Figure 3. For example, the March\nunemployment rates for males between the ages of 20 and 24 was 18.4 percent, more\nthan 5 percentage points higher than for females in the same age group.\n\nThe sharp reduction in the ratio of employment to population highlights our challenge –\nachieving a full recovery will require creating jobs for those currently unemployed and\nactively seeking work, those entering the labor force as the population grows, and those\nlikely to return to the labor force once jobs become more available. Employing all these\nworkers within a reasonable period of time will require very strong economic growth.\nThe question is, how likely is that?\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 4 shows the growth rate in each of the first three years of the last three recoveries,\nas well as the average rates for all three recoveries. The most recent two recoveries were\nquite slow to get started, but picked up steam over time. This is the pattern projected in\nmost forecasts for this recovery.\n\nOver the past three quarters, GDP has increased 3.7 percent. 2 However, some of the\ngrowth resulted from temporary rebalancing of inventories by businesses, as suggested by\nFigure 5, which shows that the percent change in real final sales was quite a bit smaller\nthan the percent change in GDP. The gap between them would be inventory rebuilding.\n\nMost private forecasts expect growth in the next four quarters to be fast enough to begin\nto make more improvement in the labor market. My own expectation is consistent with\nthis. As financial headwinds subside, and consumers and businesses gain more\nconfidence in the recovery, expenditures that have been deferred will be made – and we\nshould begin to see stronger economic growth.\n\nDespite this forecast of an improved outlook, we will need very strong growth if we are\nto return to 5 percent unemployment in a reasonable time frame. Economists frequently\nuse a rule of thumb, called Okun’s Law, to characterize the relationship between output\ngrowth and unemployment. According to Okun’s Law, if the economy grows one\npercentage point faster than its potential for one year, the result will be a decline in the\nunemployment rate of approximately one-half of a percent. Of course, I would highlight\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthat this is a rule of thumb, and that the relationship is more complicated than this and, of\ncourse, subject to error.\n\nBut using the simple rule of thumb implied by Okun’s Law, the left side of Figure 6\nshows the rates of GDP growth necessary to return unemployment to 5 percent over\ndifferent time frames. The chart highlights that we need several years of very strong\ngrowth to reach 5 percent unemployment. For example, to reach 5 percent\nunemployment by the end of 2013, real GDP growth would have to average 5 percent per\nyear. 3 Such a growth rate has some historical precedent, as shown on the right side of the\nchart, but it is much faster than the growth rate in the past two recoveries. And to reach 5\npercent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth averaging 4.2 percent per year –\nconsiderably faster than the average rate of growth after the 1991 and 2001 recessions.\n\nGiven the need for very rapid growth to get unemployment back to 5 percent, let me pose\nan oversimplified question – why would policymakers not keep monetary policy very\naccommodative, and fiscal policy very stimulative, until we had a sustained growth rate\nthat brought the economy much closer to full employment? At least on the monetary\nside, one reason might be concern among policymakers that rapid growth would be\ninflationary.\n\nTo explore that, let’s turn to Figure 7, which shows the total and core inflation rates,\nmeasured by changes in the CPI, with recession shading. What the chart shows is that\ninflation has declined in each recession, including this so-called Great Recession. It also\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nhighlights that inflation tends to continue falling in the early stages of a recovery. Figure\n8 shows the change in the inflation rate from the business cycle peak. From the peak\n(shown at zero on the horizontal axis) the inflation rate is very restrained, and generally\nnegative, for many months. With substantial excess capacity in the economy during the\nearly stages of a recovery, workers don’t tend to demand higher wages, and firms don’t\nfeel at liberty to substantially increase prices. Since the Great Recession has resulted in\nsubstantial excess capacity, it would be unusual to see increases in the inflation rate in the\nearly stages of this recovery.\n\nHowever, while inflation does not normally increase in the early stages of a recovery,\nsome economic observers may be concerned that this recovery will be different, because\nof the unusual actions that the Federal Reserve needed to take. As you know, the Federal\nReserve took extraordinary measures to stabilize the financial system – measures that\nwere critical to setting the stage for the current recovery. Figure 9 depicts the additions to\nthe central bank’s balance sheet from these temporary operations. As you can see in the\nchart, the liquidity facilities that we set up to restore more effective financial market\nfunctioning have wound down. At the same time, however, in response to the severity of\nthe economic recession the Federal Reserve decided to expand its purchases of mortgagebacked and agency securities. These purchases were undertaken to improve market\nfunctioning in the mortgage market, and even more importantly, as a way to reduce a key\ninterest rate at a time when many short-term interest rates were close to, or at, the zero\nlower bound.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe purchase program ended in March, and these balances will naturally be dropping\nover time as households prepay mortgages, sell their homes, or refinance. This decline in\nour balance sheet will actually occur without the Fed taking any specific actions. But it\nwill occur slowly, and absent any action of the Fed’s part, the balance sheet will remain\nelevated for years.\n\nThis expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet raises concerns for some observers\nand commentators. An important side effect of our asset purchases has, necessarily, been\na dramatic swelling of so called excess reserves in the banking system. When the central\nbank purchases assets, it credits the selling institution with reserves. Over time, banks\ncould choose to lend out these reserves, which would turn the reserves into broader\nmoney – and a rapid expansion of the broader money supply would be inflationary.\nHowever, as Figure 10 suggests, the current problem is not a rapid expansion in lending\nand the money supply. In fact, quite the opposite; banks have been reluctant to lend.\nMany have taken significant losses that have drained their capital; and, at the same time,\nthe financial condition of many potential borrowers is worse than before the recession. 4\n\nWere that situation to change and bank lending to accelerate, the Federal Reserve could\ndrain the excess reserves from the banking system. We have a variety of tools. We could\nsell some of our long-term assets, thereby increasing longer-term interest rates. We now\npay interest on reserves, and that rate could be increased to discourage bank lending. The\nsize of our balance sheet, the composition of the balance sheet, and our short-term\ninterest rate target are all instruments that we have available to reach our destination of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfull employment with stable prices. Fundamentally, decisions about shrinking our balance\nsheet – like decisions to tighten interest rates – should be conditional on economic\nconditions.\n\nSome analysts warn of rapid inflation arising from the expansion of the Fed’s balance\nsheet; but these forecasts have not been borne out. In fact, despite the buildup in excess\nreserves, the inflation rate has been falling – and I expect this trend to continue over the\nnear term. The experience in both Japan and the United States is that after a banking\ncrisis, excess reserves have not been inflationary in the short term. Of course, once the\nbanks have recapitalized and economic resources are more fully utilized, we would not\nwant to have a large stock of excess reserves. Again, as noted, we have a variety of tools\nto remove excess reserves at a time when that becomes appropriate.\n\nAs a result, I agree with many forecasters who expect disinflation in the near term. The\nsubstantial excess capacity in labor markets that I mentioned earlier has caused\ncompensation to decline quite markedly (see Figure 11). Because employee\ncompensation is the main cost component for most companies, lower labor costs enable\nbusinesses to improve profit margins without substantial price increases – particularly as\nthe demand for goods and services improves.\n\nThis brings us back to Yogi Berra, who famously said, “When you come to a fork in the\nroad, take it.” At times, a fork in the road is exactly what confronts monetary\npolicymakers. We would face a fork, for example, if inflationary pressures were building\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndespite a high unemployment rate. In this case, the choice between restraining inflation\nand supporting employment is a difficult one, and the policy decision becomes more\ncomplicated. However, with employment well below the level of full employment, and\ndisinflation continuing to move us away from my own inflation target of 2 percent, one\ndoes not currently need to make such trade-offs.\n\nAnother possible complication could occur if very low interest rates were causing\nexcessive, leveraged bets that were inflating the price of assets that have macroeconomic\nimportance. While we need to be vigilant against the buildup of asset bubbles, there is\nlittle evidence of such a problem now. Many financial institutions are still deleveraging –\na factor in why we are seeing too little lending rather than too much. Real estate can be a\nvery important asset because it serves as collateral for many loans. However, in the\ncurrent situation both residential and commercial real estate are, at best, stabilizing.\n\nEven if we were to see asset prices rising, it is not obvious that somewhat tighter interest\nrates will make a significant difference. A more targeted approach would be to examine\nwhether supervisors should require tighter lending standards, or higher capital\nrequirements, in areas where asset prices are appreciating rapidly. This would make\nsense from the perspective of good risk management – if institutions hold assets that\nappreciate quickly, they should retain sufficient capital and be vigilant in credit standards\nto insure that they can weather a quick reversal in asset prices. Raising short-term\ninterest rates because of exuberance in one market is a blunt, and possibly ineffective,\ntool against the exuberance of investors in a particular asset. As a result, in my view,\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshort-term interest rate-setting is better suited for calibrating the growth in the overall\neconomy, rather than focusing on a particular asset class.\n\nConcluding Observations\n\nIn sum, while the incoming economic data have certainly been more positive of late, we\nremain far from our “stated” destination. Even with rapid growth in the economy,\nspurred by accommodative monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, it is likely to\ntake years before we approach the growth and inflation rates that would really reflect\nachievement of the two elements of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n\nThe economy, while in a much better place than a year ago, is still susceptible to negative\nshocks. Serious fiscal problems loom for state and local governments, the U.S.\ngovernment, and governments around the world – particularly those that have expended\nlarge sums of money to recover from this financial crisis and recession. Clearly over time\nwe need to have much more sustainable levels of budget deficits, at all levels of\ngovernment, here in the U.S. and abroad. 5 However, I would just note that rapid\nmovement to fiscal austerity, like rapid removal of monetary accommodation, could of\ncourse significantly delay the time it takes to reach full employment.\n\nWhile financial markets have improved significantly, real estate problems, bank closures,\nand significant non-performing loans on the books of many banks continue to provide\nfinancial headwinds to the recovery. And clearly – as the headlines of the past week have\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 5, 2010 at 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nhighlighted – financial problems abroad still have the potential to result in slower U.S.\nexports, and may hold potential further problems for global financial institutions.\n\nIn sum, my view is that with inflation expectations stable, core PCE inflation rates\ndeclining, and significant excess capacity in the economy, accommodative monetary\npolicy remains appropriate.\n\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nOf course, some of this is the result of the unusual length of this recession.\n\n2\n\nYear over year, the growth is 2.5 percent – which includes one quarter of negative growth (the second\nquarter of 2009).\n\n3\n\nIf the relationship is weaker, as some researchers suggest, even stronger growth would be required to\nreduce the unemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013. For example, if the reduction in the\nunemployment rate resulting from real GDP growth of 1 percent above potential is one-third of a percent\ninstead of one-half of a percent, then real GDP growth of 6.25 percent would be needed to reduce the\nunemployment rate to 5 percent by year end 2013.\n\n4\n\nBanks must, of course, maintain their capital ratios. As some banks have taken significant losses that\ndrained capital, they have been reluctant to expand lending, so that the supply of loanable funds has likely\nbeen constrained. But this supply-side effect has been exacerbated by the credit condition of potential\nborrowers in the wake of the Great Recession. Even for banks that are less capital-constrained, with the\nbalance sheets of many potential borrowers in much worse shape than they were before the recession,\nlenders making prudent lending decisions will be reluctant to lend to high-risk potential borrowers.\n\n5\n\nSee for example the remarks by Chairman Ben Bernanke at the National Commission on Fiscal\nResponsibility and Reform on April 27, available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100427a.htm\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 1\nEmployment / Population Ratio\nJanuary 1980 -

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Global Interdependence Center's Conference on\n\"Financial Interdependence in the World's\nPost-Crisis Capital Markets\"\n\nPhiladelphia\nMarch 3, 2010\n\nThank you, Charles, for your kind introduction. I am very happy to be here today, to\noffer some perspectives on central banking and systemic supervision in an interdependent\nworld – and in particular some lessons from the past that may serve us well in the future. *\nThe past three years have dramatically underscored the interdependence of the world’s\nfinancial institutions and financial markets. The financial crisis also, by the way,\nincreased awareness of the interdependence of the actions of monetary and fiscal\nauthorities around the world. In light of the crisis and the reality of financial\ninterdependence, the Federal Reserve expanded the types of policy actions it was willing\nto take. My view is that our openness to innovative measures was critical to avoiding far\nmore severe outcomes – by which I mean cascading failures of financial firms and a\nlocking up of liquidity and credit extension, further impeding households and companies\nand eventually leading to unemployment that far exceeds our current, far too high, level.\nHowever, I must also stress that the nation’s “financial crisis toolkit” was, unfortunately,\nincomplete, resulting in the Federal Reserve needing to reluctantly take some\ncontroversial actions – notably as a result of government in general lacking adequate\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntools or powers to address the resolution (or “winding down”) of certain institutions,\nespecially systemically important nonbank financial firms. If the U.S. puts in place better\nresolution powers for such institutions, the Federal Reserve will not need to be involved\nin lending under unusual and exigent circumstances to systemically important institutions\nthat we have no regulatory or supervisory powers over, to prevent even worse outcomes.\nUnfortunately, at this point the U.S. is operating with the same incomplete toolkit\navailable to policymakers that we had before the crisis. I know that Congress is\nconsidering various proposals for financial regulatory reform. My hope is that\nestablishing resolution authority for systemically important nonbank financial firms will\nbe an area with broad bipartisan agreement and support for change.\n\nLooking Back, to Look Forward\nDespite the Fed’s aggressive use of both traditional and non-traditional policy tools, the\neconomy is experiencing a slow recovery from a very severe recession, particularly when\nit comes to jobs. 1 Still, with recent events fresh in our minds it is an appropriate time to\ndiscuss the actions a central bank should take during a crisis – and in the periods that\nprecede a crisis – and the tools and powers needed to help avoid future crises. Of course,\npolicymakers and lawmakers are studying these matters right now.\nSo now is the time to be compiling and applying the lessons of the crisis and its lead-up.\nBut as I’ve noted in other talks, we must learn the right lessons, not necessarily the\ncommonly accepted ones. The generally accepted narrative does not always stand up to\ncloser scrutiny, and reacting to these narratives might lead to the wrong remedies. When\nyou consider the human toll of this financial crisis and recession, nothing is more\nimportant than making sure we parse out and learn the “real” lessons. Otherwise the\nfixes may miss the mark and invite unintended consequences.\nSo today I would like to pose some key questions: Did monetary policy cause the\nhousing bubble that played such a large role in this crisis? Was it, as some have\nsuggested, mainly due to the Fed keeping rates too low for too long, after the 2001\nrecession? Or should our attention be less on monetary policy and more on supervisory\npolicy? Looking forward, what are the best remedies to avoid a similar crisis in the\nfuture? Do we need traditional supervision done better, as some assume, or do we need\nsomething quite different? And does the recent financial crisis and recession suggest, as\nsome say, that the central bank should not be involved in supervising financial\ninstitutions and mitigating financial instability, going forward?\nAgain, my focus is on avoiding future financial crises. In that spirit, I will touch on the\nways that the Federal Reserve could and should use a combination of monetary and\nsupervisory tools to foster better macroeconomic outcomes. To do this, I will look back\nat our recent economic history – specifically, the early part of the last decade 2 – to\ninvestigate whether we could have employed a better mix of policy actions to strengthen\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe economy after the 2001 recession while avoiding the buildup of financial imbalances\nthat occurred – in other words, avoiding the bubble that eventually burst.\nCauses of the Crisis?\nAs we unpack these issues I should begin by emphasizing that understanding the causes\nof asset-price “bubbles” is very difficult. Most economists are uncharacteristically\nhumble in admitting their ignorance about what causes asset prices to diverge from their\nfundamentals (in other words, what causes bubbles).\nStill, research by Boston Fed economists points to a clear role for house prices in the\nrecent crises. The rapid ascent of house prices – which started in 1998, accelerated in\n2004, and reversed in 2006 – is in our view central to understanding the eventual\nchallenges. The expectation of rising prices provided the incentive for potential\nhomeowners to invest more in housing, and made them – and their lenders – more\ncomfortable with putting relatively little money down. Rising prices also mitigated the\nrisk to institutions and investors that held assets based on these mortgages. After all, as\nlong as prices continued to rise, mortgage holders who got into financial trouble could\nsell or refinance rather than default, insulating the holders of their mortgages from\nfinancial loss. This encouraged more relaxed credit standards, including low\ndownpayments. Of course, a higher loan-to-value ratio exposed the homeowner and the\nlender to risk should prices fall significantly, but this risk was judged to be minimal.\nHouse prices were expected to continue rising.\nThere is evidence that financial institutions understood the risks that would arise if house\nprices fell, but assigned too low a probability to this potential outcome. Thus they were\nwoefully unprepared to weather the consequences when prices did indeed fall. Many\ninvestors believed that rising house prices made the possibility of significant losses on\nsecuritized pools of subprime loans remote. 3 They realized that a significant decline in\nhouse prices would indeed cause subprime securitization deals to suffer enormous losses,\nbut assigned a very low (or nonexistent) probability to the sort of drop in house prices\nthat actually occurred. Although some housing experts had raised concerns that the rise\nin housing prices was not sustainable, noting unusually high ratios of house prices to\nincome or rent, most took comfort in the fact that nominal housing prices had not fallen\nat the national level since World War II. Even the pessimistic forecasts tended to\nenvision a gradual leveling off of prices rather than an outright decline.\nThe story fits with the notion of a classic bubble. The key feature of a bubble is that\ninvestors willingly pay high prices not because of the asset’s intrinsic value, but because\nthey believe some other investor will pay more for it in the future. The other key element\nof a bubble is that it almost always bursts.\nAll of this implies an important role for supervisors in undertaking scenario analyses that\nwould make clear the exposures to such risks, both for individual institutions and for the\nfinancial system as a whole. I will return to this theme in a moment.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nDid Monetary Policy Cause the Bubble?\nAgain, understanding asset bubbles is not easy. One of the most prevalent theories on the\nsource of the bubble involves the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve during\nthe recovery from the 2001 recession, when the federal funds rate remained quite low –\nstaying at 1 percent from June 2003 to June 2004 (Figure 1).\nLet’s look closely at the episode. At the time, the rationale for maintaining such a low\nfederal funds rate seemed clear. That rationale is summarized in the FOMC’s outlook for\ninflation and unemployment. Figure 2 shows the internal Board of Governors staff\nforecast – a well-respected input to the FOMC’s policy deliberations – for core inflation\nand unemployment as of the end of 2003. At the time, the Board staff had forecast that\nthe unemployment rate would gradually fall to 5 percent over the next two years, while\ncore inflation (as measured by changes in the core consumer price index or CPI) would\nedge down slightly and remain around 1.5 percent. Five percent was the staff estimate of\n“full employment” at that time; so to put this another way, the unemployment rate was\nexpected to be above the full employment level for the next two years. Meanwhile,\ninflation was expected to be low. 4\nWhile the unemployment forecast was spot on, the inflation forecast was, in contrast, too\nlow. Actual inflation was higher and more erratic. Had the Federal Reserve’s inflation\nforecast been more accurate, monetary policy might have been somewhat less\naccommodative.\nAdditionally, in the post-September 11 environment, potential downside risks to the\neconomy from other terrorist attacks were a concern. Policymakers were also anxious\nnot to repeat the mistakes of their Japanese counterparts in the 1990s, who had withdrawn\nsupport prematurely, leading to deflation and a lost decade of economic growth.\nSo, did accommodative interest rates fuel the housing bubble? Actually, the relationship\nbetween interest rates and bubbles is not as obvious as one might think. Figure 3\nhighlights the federal funds rate and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. While the 30-year\nrate declined during the period of federal funds rate easing, the drop was relatively\nmodest relative to the decline in the fed funds rate. Over the 10 years shown in the chart,\nthe 30 year mortgage rate averaged 5.99 percent; while during the one-year period when\nthe federal funds rate was 1 percent, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 5.51 percent. As\nthe federal funds rate increased in 2005 and 2006, the 30-year mortgage rate fluctuated\nclose to the 10 year average.\nSo mortgage rates were a bit lower while Fed policy was accommodative – but not\ndramatically lower. 5 Most economic models of housing price movements would suggest\nthat such relatively modest fluctuations in mortgage rates – less than half a percent –\nwould produce only modest changes in house prices. 6\nMoreover, contrary to the generally-assumed narrative, the empirical link between\nperiods with low interest rates and asset bubbles is not particularly strong. Generally\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nspeaking, lower interest rates lead to higher prices for a wide variety of assets, but they\ndo not necessarily lead people to expect continued increases in asset prices – that key\ncharacteristic of a bubble that I mentioned a moment ago.\nIn addition, house prices also rose rapidly in other countries – in many cases more rapidly\nthan in the United States. See Figure 4. Ireland and Spain, in particular, witnessed\ndramatic booms in house prices – and subsequent declines. Note that in contrast\nGermany, which had the same monetary policy as Ireland and Spain, did not experience a\ndramatic increase. All this makes it difficult to root an explanation for the bubble entirely\nin the choices made by U.S. monetary policymakers.\nI am not saying that low rates could have had no role in moving housing prices higher.\nBut I suspect the booming demand for real estate derived in large measure from incorrect\nexpectations that housing prices would not fall, rather than from the short-run effect on\nhousing demand of low short-term rates and slightly lowered mortgage rates.\nPolicy Responses\nIf we cannot predict when bubbles will happen – or even, as many suggest, identify their\npresence – then what can policymakers do? Financial policymakers can ameliorate the\nproblems that bubbles cause by taking a forward-looking and systemic view of financial\nrisk regulation. Traditional “prudential” supervision tends to focus on areas of high risk at\nindividual institutions. Systemic or “macroprudential” supervision needs to focus on\npossible misperceptions (and mispricing) of risk more generally and the way that risk is\ndispersed throughout the system, directly and indirectly. More scenario analysis, such as\nthat done in the so-called “stress test” of large institutions last year, needs to be a focus\nfor future systemic supervision – whether accomplished by a given agency or a council\ncharged with systemic oversight.\nIn the financial context, forward-looking risk regulation focused on scenario analysis may\nhave done a better job of identifying potential risks from a bursting bubble. Properly\ndone, scenario analysis would have highlighted the sensitivity of financial institutions to\nvarious risks, like falling house prices. Not that this is easy to do. But certainly it is\nrealistic to say that scenario analysis could have identified that values and ratings of\nsubprime securities (especially the most exotic) were extraordinarily sensitive to\nassumptions for which no one had especially good information. This suggests the need,\ngoing forward, for more “stress-test” type exercises – to first identify, and then address, 7\nemerging risks.\nTraditional bank supervision tends to focus on the current condition of a firm by\nidentifying write-downs of nonperforming assets and validating the ratings of loans and\nthe adequacy of reserves. This partly reflects the current focus in accounting on incurred\nlosses. In contrast, the systemic supervision that is needed would focus on possible\nfuture losses and is inherently forward-looking. Doing this well requires an\nunderstanding not only of institutions but also markets, and it requires taking into account\nthe full range of outcomes, both expected and potential – including those that have a low\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlikelihood of occurring but that could have serious adverse consequences. While we may\nnot be able to eliminate all bubbles, we should be able to limit the degree to which the\nfinancial sector feeds and propagates these booms, and the sector’s vulnerability to\nsubsequent busts.\nSuch work is particularly well suited for the Fed. Its role as “lender of last resort” (where\nwe lend at a penalty rate and have never had a Discount Window loss), its responsibility\nfor bank supervision, and its constant monitoring of the economy provide the Federal\nReserve with a unique window on financial-stability issues. It is a serious gap that there\nis no assigned responsibility for forward-looking, systemic risk supervision – and filling\nthis gap in some way is probably the highest priority in regulatory reform.\nI would also emphasize the systemic nature of optimal supervision and regulation,\nbecause another aspect of achieving financial stability involves understanding the\ninterdependence of financial institutions. Ideally, supervisors should have a good idea of\nhow a failure of one institution would impact its counterparties; as well as the\ncircumstances under which a large number of institutions would become insolvent. Most\naccounts of the financial crisis make clear how concern about counterparty risk fuelled\npanic among market participants. It also weighed mightily on policymakers trying to\ncobble together solutions to the crisis.\nIt goes without saying that understanding counterparty risk can be exceptionally\ncomplicated. Large financial institutions have a variety of subsidiaries around the world.\nAs a result of acquisitions they often have legacy information systems that can make it\ndifficult to aggregate their true counterparty exposure to one entity. Certainly this is an\narea where financial institutions and regulators need to do more work, to be better\nprepared for any future crises.\nAs part of scenario analysis, firms should be asked by supervisors to provide information\non counterparties and exposure, to examine how major counterparty failures would affect\nthem – and, if possible, how their own failure would impact their major counterparties.\nThe regulators should then be able to compare results across institutions to get a better\nappreciation of, and ability to monitor, the counterparty risk.\nWe want analysts within a given financial institution to realize their firm would take big\nlosses if, for example, a particular asset price were to fall. A systemic supervisor,\nconducting similar analyses across a variety of institutions, could see if others were in\nsimilar shape. And even if this supervisor saw only a small chance of a “meltdown”\nscenario for a particular asset price, they could evaluate the impact and perhaps conclude\nthat the chance of a cascading systemic financial crisis was too big of a chance to take.\nOf course, it is also important to understand under what economic or financial situations\nsuch problems might rear their heads. Supervisors need to collect this information\nregularly, and some public reporting of interconnectedness would provide the public with\na useful understanding of the risks inherent in the institutions, markets, and systems on\nwhich they rely.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nConcluding Observations\nTo conclude, I would just stress that supervisory tools can and should provide an\nalternative to monetary policy actions for addressing bubbles or other imbalances in\ncertain areas of the economy or financial system. If we take a good hard analytical look\nat the last recovery, we see that the low fed funds rate was not the standout, and\nstandalone, culprit that many assume. This is a crucial matter to consider right now,\nwhen rates are very low – in my opinion, totally appropriately – because some are\npredicting that these rates will fuel another bubble.\nFinancial regulatory reform needs to address who has responsibility for regulating and\nsupervising systemic risk as well as who has responsibility for regulating and supervising\nsystemically important institutions. In particular, reform should enhance the potential to\nwind down or resolve systemically important institutions that are failing. This is critical\nto avoiding future crises.\nBecause of the substantial synergies between monetary policy, the lender-of-last-resort\nrole, and supervision of banks, I believe the Federal Reserve should play a significant\nrole in overseeing systemically important institutions and addressing systemic risks. It is\nalso important that the Federal Reserve continue to supervise community banks, which\nprovide a window on lending to small businesses and other bank-dependent borrowers.\nThe reality is that supervisory policies should not be independent of monetary policy –\nand similarly monetary policy should not be conducted without the valuable insights\ngained from supervision of large and small banks. Understanding the business cycle and\nits potential impact on the institutions under supervision should be integral to bank\nsupervision and to understanding systemic risk. And supervisory powers provide an\nimportant alternative tool to traditional monetary policy as a way to address bubbles and\ninsure the best possible economic outcome.\nThe crisis has highlighted how undesirable it is for the U.S. central bank to have to be\ninvolved in the rescue of individual institutions. However, it has also reinforced the\nimportant role that the central bank can and should play in maintaining financial stability.\nRemember that concerns over financial instability and the experience of financial panics\nwere key motivations for the founding of the Federal Reserve by Congress. No one is\nhappy with the current state of the economy and the suffering of so many Americans who\nseek jobs or face foreclosure. But the Federal Reserve’s efforts to help maintain financial\nstability have averted much worse outcomes.\nI believe the Federal Reserve can and should be more focused on financial stability issues\ngoing forward. As a result, whatever actions are taken in Washington with regulatory\nreform, it is in everyone’s interest that any changes not impede the ability of the Federal\nReserve to be a lender of last resort or to troubleshoot the functioning of financial\nmarkets during a crisis.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, March 3, 2010 at 9:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWith all this in mind, I would say that legislation that does not provide a significant\nsupervisory and systemic responsibility for the Federal Reserve risks making us as a\nnation even less prepared for the next crisis than we were for this one.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee my recent remarks on prospects for employment and evidence from prior recoveries, available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2010/010810/index.htm\n\n2\n\nA disclaimer: while the comparison yields insights, we should also recognize that the 2001 recession and\nrecovery were of course somewhat different than the current situation.\n3\n\nFor example, an August 2005 Lehman Brothers report on the expected performance, under various houseprice scenarios, of securitized pools of subprime loans suggests that Lehman Brothers realized that a\nsignificant decline in house prices would cause subprime securitization deals to suffer enormous losses.\nSpecifically, in the report’s “meltdown” scenario for house prices, the cumulative collateral losses would\nbe 17.1 percent as all but the highest-rated securities in the subprime pools default. To understand why\ninvestors might have viewed these securities as a good investment anyway, one need only see that\nLehman’s analysts assigned the “meltdown” scenario a probability of only 5 percent. Note that the\nmeltdown scenario implied a smaller drop in housing prices than what actually occurred.\n\n4\n\nFor an in-depth analysis of monetary policy during this period, as well as the relationship of interest rates\nto housing prices, see Dokko et al.

Over the decade the one-year adjustable-rate mortgage rate averaged 5.06 percent and fell to\n3.71 percent over the June 2003- June 2004 period.\n6\n\nNor is the theoretical logic that links housing prices and asset bubbles to low interest rates nearly as\nobvious as many suggest. Standard models of housing prices, based on the user cost of owning a home,\nimply that housing prices rise only modestly when interest rates fall. This does not necessarily mean that\nthose models are correct, only that it is hard to build a prima facie case that monetary policy caused the\nhousing bubble.\n\n7\n\nFor example by requiring that capital be raised or certain activities curtailed.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1\nFederal Funds Target Rate\nJanuary 3, 2000 - February 26, 2010\n\nPercent\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nRange:\n0 - 0.25%\n\n0\n3-Jan-00 2-Jan-01 2-Jan-02 2-Jan-03 2-Jan-04 3-Jan-05 3-Jan-06 3-Jan-07 3-Jan-08 2-Jan-09 4-Jan-10\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n1\n\nFigure 2\nUnemployment and Core Inflation Rates:\nBoard of Governors Internal Staff Forecast\nand Actual Results\nFourth Quarter 2003 - Third Quarter 2005\n\nYear\n\nDecember 2003 Greenbook Forecast\nUnemployment Core CPI Inflation\nRate\nRate\n%\nChange\n%\n\nActual Results\nUnemployment Core CPI Inflation\nRate\nRate\n%\nChange\n%\n\n2003\n\nQuarter\nQ4\n\n6.0\n\n1.8\n\n5.8\n\n1.0\n\n2004\n\nQ1\n\n6.0\n\n1.6\n\n5.7\n\n1.9\n\n2004\n\nQ2\n\n5.8\n\n1.5\n\n5.6\n\n2.6\n\n2004\n\nQ3\n\n5.5\n\n1.5\n\n5.4\n\n1.7\n\n2004\n\nQ4\n\n5.3\n\n1.5\n\n5.4\n\n2.5\n\n2005\n\nQ1\n\n5.2\n\n1.5\n\n5.3\n\n2.5\n\n2005\n\nQ2\n\n5.1\n\n1.5\n\n5.1\n\n1.9\n\n2005\n\nQ3\n\n5.0\n\n1.5\n\n5.0\n\n1.3\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, BLS / Haver Analytics\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 3\nMortgage Rates and the\nFederal Funds Target Rate\n2000:Q1 - 2009:Q4\n\nPercent\n10\n8\n30-Year Fixed-Rate Conventional Mortgage Rate\n\n6\n4\n2\nRange:\n0 - 0.25%\n\nFederal Funds Target Rate\n\n0\n2000:Q1\n\n2002:Q1\n\n2004:Q1\n\n2006:Q1\n\n2008:Q1\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n3\n\nFigure 4\nReal House Price Increases\n1994 - 2008\n\nIndex, 1994=100\n400\nIreland\n\n350\n\nSpain\n\n300\n\nUnited States\nGermany\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n1994\n\nSource: OECD\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n4\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Connecticut Business & Industry Association\nand the MetroHartford Alliance\nEconomic Summit & Outlook 2010\n\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\nI am very pleased to be back at this important event, focused on the economy in\nthe year ahead. I thank Jim Smith for that generous introduction, and the CBIA and the\nMetroHartford Alliance for inviting me to share my perspectives with you. *\nAs we begin a new year, financial markets are in a much better state than they\nwere a year ago. Interest spreads reflecting a “panic premium” on risk have narrowed to\nmore normal levels, markets have resumed much more normal trading patterns, and the\nFederal Reserve is likely to be able to wind down many of its emergency lending\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfacilities without any adverse impacts, as soon as next month – as the Federal Open\nMarket Committee affirmed in its statement last month.\nBut despite the improvement in financial conditions, the recovery in the real\neconomy has proceeded more slowly – with the declines in the first half of 2009 turning\nto slow but positive growth in the third quarter, and what appears to be stronger growth in\nthe fourth quarter. This is resulting, in part, from firms less aggressively cutting\ninventories as their sales prospects improve. 1\nIn sum it seems to me that growth will be positive, but slow enough that\nunemployment remains much higher than I would like. I would be happy if in hindsight\nit is clear I have been too pessimistic. But as I see it, the economy faces three significant\n“headwinds.”\nFirst, while the banking crisis has passed, banking problems remain. Most\neconomies that experience significant banking problems have been slow to recover, and\nthat is likely to be true this time in the U.S. Loans at banks have declined over the past\nseveral quarters, as many businesses are constrained by their balance sheets and reluctant\nto take on new debt. 2 Many banks are also concerned with their balance sheets – and\nparticularly their capital ratios 3 -- and have restrained their terms of lending to avoid\ntaking on too much additional risk, given that they are still working through problems\nwith existing loans.\nSecond, consumers and businesses will likely remain cautious – which is\nconsistent with positive but slow growth. Consumption will continue to be subdued, as\nconsumers are fully aware that housing prices are well off their peak, unemployment\nrates are high, and home foreclosures are continuing. Consumer caution and the desire to\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nrebuild savings will likely result in some increase in the savings rate, which is of course\ngood in the long run but dampens growth in the short term. Many businesses seem likely\nto only gradually expand investment, at least until they are more confident that the\neconomy will continue expanding even after some of the stimulative government support\nwinds down. Also, many businesses may be limited in how much external funding they\ncan raise.\nThe third headwind involves the fact that recessions this severe have broader\nramifications for labor markets. Workers become discouraged and leave the labor force,\nwhile the skills of workers that are unemployed for long periods may atrophy, and new\nentrants in the labor market often have to settle for jobs at levels below what they would\nbe offered in a more robust economy.\nIndeed, to most Americans, economic prospects are better measured by an\nexpansion of jobs rather than growth in GDP. So I would like to spend the rest of my\ntime with you reviewing some of the patterns we have seen in labor markets during early\nstages of previous recoveries. Of course, given the severity of this recession, consumer\nand business behavior this time may be somewhat more restrained than in past recoveries.\nTo reveal a bit of the “punch line,” my conclusions from the analysis I am about\nto walk through are that the employment response in the last two recoveries was much\nslower than it was in the two earlier recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s. 4 And\nunfortunately the financial headwinds, lingering labor market problems, and a cautious\nattitude of consumers and businesses in the wake of the financial crisis make it likely that\nrecovery in employment terms will also be slow this time.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nUnfortunately, I expect a rather slow recovery in output, and a rather slow\nrecovery in employment given the level of output growth – and I will explain why, this\nmorning. But since unemployment is so fundamentally important, I think it is good to\nstudy our labor markets and earlier recovery periods so policymakers, businesses, and\nworkers can anticipate and adapt to the experience we are likely to see.\nIn addition, I would note that during the early phases of a recovery, improvements\nin unemployment tend to lag those in the economy. But the strength of the recovery is\npartly dependent on how confident businesses and consumers are becoming that the\neconomy will be able to grow fast enough for tangible progress in labor markets and the\nrecovery will become self sustaining.\n\nEmployment Patterns in the First Year of Recovery\nAllow me to walk you through a few slides that help illustrate employment\npatterns in the first year of recoveries.\nGDP growth in the just-completed fourth quarter of 2009 looks like it will prove\nto have been stronger than in the third quarter, a result largely driven by businesses\nbringing their significant inventory draw-down to a close.\nAs shown in Figure 1, this is not unusual for the first year of a recovery. Consider\nthe following logic. The difference between real GDP and real final sales is the change\nin inventories. In the first year of the recovery from the four previous recessions, real\nGDP grew faster than real final sales. This shows how the normalizing of inventories has\nbeen an important source of economic growth in the early stages of most recoveries.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe figure shows that the smallest inventory response was in the recovery in the\nearly 1990s. Since inventories are often bank-financed, so-called headwinds provided by\nthe troubles in the banking system that result in credit constraints are, unfortunately, a\npotential source of restraint on inventory replenishment now, as then. Indeed, research I\nhave done with colleagues Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell confirms that inventory buildup\ntends to be more restrained during periods of significant banking problems.\nThus today, as in the early 1990s, inventory levels became quite low during this\nrecession as businesses prepared for the worst, and I expect that inventory buildup will be\nan important source of growth – but also that it will likely be more restrained than one\nmight have otherwise expected, because of tighter credit conditions.\nFigure 2 shows that the past two recoveries did not feature job growth in the first\nyear of the recovery, in sharp contrast to the recoveries of the 1970s and 1980s. The past\ntwo recessions had positive economic growth in the first year of the recovery, but it was\nnot rapid enough to generate job growth. In contrast, in the recoveries in the 1970s and\n1980s, growth was sufficient to yield employment growth in the first year of the recovery.\nFigure 3 illustrates another pattern typical of recoveries. While there has been a\nlongstanding downward trend in the average weekly hours of production workers, it is\ncommon for average hours to decline more steeply during a recession. Note that in\nprolonged recessions, where the shading is the widest, average weekly hours decline\nmore significantly – as workers are placed on shortened work weeks.\nAs the economy begins to recover, businesses will restore the hours of such\nworkers before hiring additional new workers. Note that in our current recession, there\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwas a significant decline in the hours of production workers, which are just beginning to\nshow signs of a rebound.\nAnother harbinger of a recovery in employment is growth in temporary services.\nFirms often extend work weeks and hire temporary workers before committing to hiring\npermanent workers. As Figure 4 highlights, the use of temporary workers fell quite\ndramatically during the recession, but has been rebounding more recently. Of course\ntemporary jobs reduce the unemployment rate, and provide a needed bridge for workers\nlooking for, but not yet finding, more permanent employment. But when businesses\nbecome more confident of the strength of the recovery, they will begin to hire permanent\nworkers rather than rely on temporary workers.\n\nLabor-Market Dynamics that Impact Employment Growth\nNow I would like to explore with you some of the labor-market dynamics that\nwill likely restrain employment growth in this recovery.\nThe severity of a recession can have a significant impact on how quickly firms\nresume hiring. As Figure 5 shows, this recession was quite severe in a number of\nrespects. This recession was much longer than typical, making it difficult for those that\nlost their jobs to find employment. Research has highlighted the fact that workers that\nhave been unemployed for extended periods can have significant difficulty being rehired.\nIt may be that their skills atrophy, or just that their sector of the economy is particularly\nhard-hit. And potential employers may worry about the underlying reasons for the long\nunemployment spell.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs shown in the figure, currently the percentage of the unemployed who have\nbeen out of work for 27 weeks or more is much higher than in previous recessions, at just\nunder 40 percent. This is likely to be one impediment to our seeing significant, speedy\ndeclines in unemployment.\nThe next set of challenges is related to the lack of business confidence that I cited\nearlier. Businesses are most likely to hire new workers when they are confident that their\nsales and orders will increase significantly for an extended period of time. Absent this\nconfidence, businesses have at their disposal several alternatives for deploying more\nlabor without incurring all the costs entailed in new hires.\nThe first of these alternatives is reflected in the blue line in Figure 6. Roughly 6\npercent of the labor force is working part time for reasons related to the economy. Such a\nhigh percentage of workers being placed on part time work schedules is, as you can see in\nthe figure, much higher than in the past two recessions – and was last at these levels in\nthe 1980s.\nMany workers reflected in these data had their schedules reduced to part time\nbecause employers want to retain them but did not have sufficient work to keep them on\nfull time. Before an employer is likely to do any significant new hiring, they will usually\nreturn these workers to full time work. While that defers new hiring, it does of course\nmean additional income for the worker.\nA second alternative to permanent hires is evident in the data for weekly\novertime, which declined quite significantly during this recession, as shown in Figure 7.\nBusinesses frequently will not only restore the aforementioned workers to full time\nstatus, but also begin incurring overtime before making the investment in new hires.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile there has been some rebound in overtime work, you can see in the figure that it\nremains well below pre-recession levels.\nA final alternative to employment growth is improving the efficiency of the\nexisting work force. In recent quarters, employers have found ways to produce more\ngoods with fewer workers. While a more productive work force is very good news for\nthe economy in the long run, it lessens the need for hiring in the short run.\nThe combination of these labor market challenges and the headwinds from\nproblems in the banking sector make it quite likely that the unemployment rate will\ndecline only gradually. While layoffs are subsiding, in sum it seems that new hiring is\nlikely only after employers more fully utilize existing employees.\n\nIndustry Patterns\nNow I would like to share some thoughts on various industries and recoveries.\nFigure 8 shows the changes that have occurred in the industrial mix of\nemployment over the past 30 years. Overall, much less of the work force is employed in\nmanufacturing, which has fallen from 21 percent of the work force to only 9 percent of\nthe work force now. The two areas that have increased significantly are professional and\nbusiness services, and education and health services – both areas that have tended to be\nless responsive to economic downturns.\nGiven the difficulties in predicting overall employment trends going forward, it is\neven more difficult to determine which industries are likely to be engines of growth.\nHowever, it is instructive to see which industries, in the past, have tended to grow in the\nfirst year of a recovery.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 9 shows four industries that have tended to perform well in the first year\nof a recovery – professional and business services, education and health services, leisure\nand hospitality, and to a lesser extent government. The first three are areas that have\nincreased their share of total employment, and all have tended to be less sensitive to\neconomic downturns.\nWhile it is quite possible that these areas will grow in the initial stages of this\nrecovery, that growth is likely to be restrained by various factors. In education and health\nservices, there is the matter of the significant retrenchment in college endowments, and\nuncertainty as national health reform proposals are debated in Washington. Government\nspending grew modestly in the first year of the past recoveries from recessions. This\ntime, however, the outlook for government employment remains quite dim – as federal,\nstate, and city governments struggle with rather severe revenue shortfalls and budget\nissues.\nProfessional and business services, and leisure and hospitality, have often\nincreased employment in the first year of a recovery; however, the degree has been\nsignificantly less in the past two recoveries compared to the 1980s (and in fact negative\nfor professional and business services in 2001-2002). The strength in these sectors this\ntime around will depend on how quickly consumer and business confidence returns.\nFigure 10 highlights industries that have had more mixed results in the first year\nof a recovery and are uncertain this time as well. While construction employment will be\nrestrained by low housing prices and elevated foreclosures – and commercial\nconstruction employment is restrained in many areas by falling commercial real estate\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nprices and high vacancy rates – employment levels in these sectors have experienced\nsuch significant declines that we may still see some rebound.\nThe behavior of the consumer will help determine employment in manufacturing\nand retail trade. It is unclear how willing consumers will be to increase spending once\nthe government’s various stimulus programs abate. If consumption is relatively\nrestrained, as many expect, then these sectors are not likely to hire significantly until\nconsumers become more confident. On the bright side, though, a potential upside to\nmanufacturing employment is the strong growth occurring in some emerging economies\nand prevailing exchange rates that favor U.S. exports.\n\nConcluding Observations\nTo sum up my remarks and conclude, I think we can gain insights on this\nrecovery from the experience and trends of the past. Certainly for economies that\nexperience substantial financial shocks, recovery is normally quite slow. While\ninventory rebuilding will likely provide some spark, the strength of underlying demand as\ngovernment stimulus subsides is an open question.\nThe employment picture overall has improved, and the outlook is certainly much\nbrighter than one year ago. Layoffs are abating, although many firms are not yet ready to\ndo new permanent hiring. Any significant hiring will likely have to wait while current\nlabor resources are more fully utilized.\nSo it appears that this recovery will likely experience only a slow improvement in\nthe employment picture, and that the unemployment rate will remain quite elevated\nduring the early phases of the recovery. GDP growth is expected to be strong enough to\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproduce some employment growth, but that rate of employment expansion will not likely\nbe rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate.\nOur research and analysis at the Boston Fed suggests that with significant\ncapacity in labor markets, wages and salaries and the ability of businesses to increase\nprices are all likely to be restrained, resulting in little immediate inflationary pressures.\nIn my view this should allow for accommodative monetary policy to continue to support\nthe economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes selfsustaining.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I do wish each of you\nsolid improvements in your businesses in the year ahead, and better economic times for\nall New Englanders as the recovery proceeds. Thank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nWhile most private forecasters have inventories declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of 2010, the\ndecline is projected to be at a slower rate (i.e., firms cutting less from their inventories), thus\nadding to GDP growth.\n\n2\n\nIn a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke noted that “the decline in bank\nloans outstanding has been stark. For example, our data show that total loans on banks' books fell\nat an annual rate of more than 11 percent during the third quarter of 2009, with all major loan\ncategories contributing to the decline…” She goes on to describe a number of factors at work in\nexplaining the reduction in bank loans in her remarks, available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20100104a.htm.\n3\n\nAs I have noted in prior talks, the losses of capital and de-leveraging of balance sheets at\nfinancial institutions serve as a drag on the economy, as financial institutions focus on\nrestructuring their balance sheets with the consequent tightening of lending standards. Recall that\na loan is counted as an asset on a bank's balance sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve\nagainst the possibility that a loan defaults, and must maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to\nassets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it must take steps to shrink the\nasset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio. The bank\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 8, 2010 at 10:15 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbecomes more restrictive in its lending – no small matter for the broader economy when you\nconsider that, thanks to leverage, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans\nby much more to maintain its capital-to-assets ratio. In addition to this state of affairs, often\nreferred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a new and unwelcome wrinkle occurred in many short-term credit\nmarkets during the recent financial turmoil − something you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By\nliquidity lock, I mean extreme risk aversion by many investors and institutions, which makes\nshort-term financing difficult to come by for even the most creditworthy firms – even financing\nfor very short maturities, measured in days. See “The Impact of Financial Institutions and\nFinancial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of a 'Liquidity Lock'”, delivered at The\nUniversity of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm\n4\n\nAs is often done, here we lump the very brief 1980:Q2 “credit” recession with the 1981-82\nrecession.\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 1\nReal Growth in First Year of Recovery\nPercent Change from Trough (Year Earlier)\n8\nReal GDP\nReal Final Sales\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1975:Q1 - 1976:Q1\n\n1982:Q4 - 1983:Q4\n\nSource: BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n1991:Q1 - 1992:Q1\n\n2001:Q4 - 2002:Q4\n\n\fFigure 2\nEmployment Growth in First Year of Recovery\nIndex, Trough = 100\n104\n1975:Q1 - 1976:Q1\n\n103\n102\n\n1982:Q4 - 1983:Q4\n1991:Q1 - 1992:Q1\n2001:Q4 - 2002:Q4\n\n101\n100\n99\n98\nTrough\n\nQ1\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n\fFigure 3\nAverage Weekly Hours of Production and\nNonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1964 – November 2009\n\nAverage Weekly Hours\n40\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n38\n\n1\n1\n\n36\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n34\n\n0\n0\n\n32\n\n0\n\nJan-64 Jan-68 Jan-72 Jan-76 Jan-80 Jan-84 Jan-88 Jan-92 Jan-96 Jan-00 Jan-04 Jan-08\nRecession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 4\nGrowth in Temporary Help Services Employment\nFebruary 1990 – November 2009\n\nPercent Change from Previous Month\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\nFeb-90 Feb-92 Feb-94 Feb-96 Feb-98 Feb-00 Feb-02 Feb-04 Feb-06 Feb-08\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\fFigure 5\nEmployment Challenges:\nPercent Unemployed for 27 Weeks or More\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\n\nPercent\n40\n\n8\nPercent of unemployed out of\nwork for 27 weeks or more\n\n35\n\n7\n\n30\n\n6\n\n25\n\n5\n\n20\n\n4\n\n15\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 6\nEmployment Challenges: Percent of Labor Force\nPart Time for Economic Reasons\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\n\nPercent\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\nPercent of labor force part time\nfor economic reasons\n\n1\n0\n\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 7\nAverage Weekly Overtime Hours of Production\nand Nonsupervisory Workers\nJanuary 1959 – November 2009\n\nAverage Weekly Overtime Hours\n6\n\n1\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nJan-59 Jan-64 Jan-69 Jan-74 Jan-79 Jan-84 Jan-89 Jan-94 Jan-99 Jan-04 Jan-09\nRecession\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 8\nEmployment Composition by Major\nIndustry Sector\nNovember 1980\n\nNovember 2009\n\nMining and Logging\n\n0.5%\n1.2%\n\n4.5%\n\nConstruction\n\n4.9%\n\n18.1%\n\n8.9%\n\n17.2%\n\nManufacturing\n20.5%\n3.1%\n\nTrade, Transportation & Utilities\nInformation Services\n\n4.1%\n\n19.1%\n\nFinancial Activities\n7.4%\n\nProfessional & Business Services\nEducation & Health Services\n\n10.0%\n\n7.9%\n\nLeisure & Hospitality\n20.3%\n\n2.1%\n\nOther Services\n\n5.9%\n\n14.8%\n\n8.4%\n5.6%\n\n2.6%\n\nSource: BLS / Haver Analytics\n\nGovernment\n\n12.8%\n\n\fFigure 9\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:\nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nPercent Change from Year Earlier\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\nProfessional & Business Services\nEducation & Health Services\nLeisure & Hospitality\nGovernment\n\n-8\n1975:Q1 - 1976:Q1\n\n1982:Q4 - 1983:Q4\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n1991:Q1 - 1992:Q1\n\n2001:Q4 - 2002:Q4\n\n\fFigure 10\nRecovery in Employment by Industry Sector:\nGrowth in First Year of Recovery\nPercent Change from Year Earlier\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\nConstruction\nManufacturing\nRetail Trade\n\n-8\n1975:Q1 - 1976:Q1\n\n1982:Q4 - 1983:Q4\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n1991:Q1 - 1992:Q1\n\n2001:Q4 - 2002:Q4\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nEuropean Economics and Financial Centre\nDistinguished Speakers Seminar\n\nLondon, England\nNovember 10, 2009\n\nIt is a pleasure to be at the European Economics and Financial Centre to discuss a very\nimportant and timely issue – how we can avoid having global banks create global problems. *\nI applaud the Center’s focus on both economics and finance, and on the nexus between the\npublic and private sectors. Much of my own research career has been similarly focused, with\nparticular attention to the connections between economics and finance, and to the ways that financial\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board\nof Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nproblems can spill over to the real economy – research that, I am sorry to say, turned out to be quite\nuseful during the recent crisis.\nIndeed, one of the lessons from this crisis is how underappreciated were the potential\nspillovers from financial problems to the economy. I think it is incumbent on us to explore the\nimplications of these spillovers for both public policy and macroeconomic modeling – which\ngenerally incorporates little if any role for financial intermediaries and their problems. 1\nMy remarks today center on a particular irony that I would like to discuss – that, despite the\nwidespread acknowledgement of the “too big to fail” problem, many of our largest global banks have\nactually expanded during the crisis. Indeed, in many cases the sizes of the largest banks have become\nquite large relative to the sizes of both their home and host countries.\nAs a result, the ability – more specifically, the economic capacity – of many countries to\nresolve troubled global banks is, in some instances, in question. Also, the potential cost to taxpayers\nhas made providing emergency government support to global banks deeply unpopular – a situation\nthat in some cases significantly complicates the available resolution options. Nor is this a new\nproblem, as illustrated by the Japanese experience in the previous decade.\nPolicymakers, academics, and other observers are proposing a variety of measures that would\nreduce the probability of a large bank failing, or limit the potential impact if a large bank does fail.\nBut please note that I am sharing my own general views today, rather than discussing any specific\nproposal under consideration. 2\nUnderlining the seriousness of the matter, I would note that large banks do not tend to fail in\nisolation. Rather, large-bank failures tend to be clustered – highlighting the need to minimize the\nmacroeconomic impact should groups of large banks become troubled.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nAfter briefly reviewing some of the issues that have become evident in the recent crisis, I will\ncover some of the options for reform. Allow me to preview some of my points, which I will then go\non to explore more fully:\n\n•\n\nFirst, despite concerns about the too-big-to-fail issue, in a variety of countries the largest\nbanks are becoming ever larger relative to the size of the economy. 3\n\n•\n\nSecond, banks that are global (not just large) create additional complications – they are\nmore difficult to resolve and can “export” capital adequacy problems (a so-called “credit\ncrunch”) to countries that host their operations.\n\n•\n\nThird, so-called “living wills” that outline, in advance, wind-down arrangements in the\nevent of a failure, are not only important for addressing too-big-to-fail problems but can\nalso be used to enhance the coordination of the bank regulators and supervisors in various\naffected countries – which should improve resolution procedures.\n\n•\n\nFourth, narrowly defining the acceptable activities of financial institutions will merely\nshift the location of systemic problems, rather than reduce them. Instead, systemically\nimportant institutions should in my view be required to hold greater reserves and capital,\nto be built up during good times. Also, measures should be put in place that would\nfacilitate global banks’ obtaining and retaining capital during economic downturns. Such\nmeasures could include automatic reductions of dividends, and required use of debt\ninstruments that could be converted to equity should the firms face a liquidity or solvency\ncrisis. And in general, supervisory policy should be more focused on the potential buildup of systemic risk.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nGlobal Banks, Global Problems\nOne of the salient features of the most recent crisis is that among banking institutions, initially\nthe problems were concentrated in large global institutions actively engaged in complex financial\ntransactions.\nThis feature of the crisis created a number of significant complications. First, because many\nof the troubled financial transactions were bilateral – that is, between two firms or counterparties\nrather than through established exchanges – the firms were not only large, but were highly\ninterconnected. As a result, the ability (or inability) to fulfill the terms of financial contracts had a\nsignificant potential to impact counterparties. Second, when a large interconnected financial\ninstitution became troubled, there were only a very limited number of institutions with sufficient size\nor sophistication to acquire the problem institution. Third, banking problems are particularly difficult\nto resolve when the banking institution spans national borders. Because of the nation-specific nature\nof bankruptcy codes, bank regulation, bank supervision, and lender-of-last-resort facilities, there are\ncurrently no robust infrastructures for addressing the resolution issues surrounding global institutions.\nFourth, many of the activities that proved problematic were transactions involving supposedly highlyrated assets held in off-balance-sheet entities like conduits or “structured investment vehicles,” which\nwere not particularly transparent. And the legal, accounting, and reputational issues surrounding\nthese off-balance-sheet activities were often unclear.\nThe result was that a variety of financial institutions became “too big to fail” not because of\ndeposits, but rather because they were so intertwined in the global financial infrastructure that their\ndisorderly failure could cause the flow of financial transactions to freeze – calling into question the\nfinancial viability of their counterparties and the functioning of markets where they were key players.\nIn essence, “too big to fail” was really “too interconnected to fail” or “too relied-upon to fail.”\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nAgain, as the discussion of too-big-to-fail institutions has increased so (somewhat ironically)\nhas the size of many of our largest global financial firms. Figure 1 shows the size of the three largest\nU.S. banks, relative to the size of U.S. GDP. As is clear from the figure, the largest institutions have\nover time become larger relative to the size of the economy. And not only have many of the largest\nU.S. banking institutions grown larger, but in some cases they have become more complex – as they\nacquired firms that offer investment banking services and, also, expanded the global reach of the\nacquiring firm.\nThe trend toward rapid growth of the largest financial institutions has not been unique to the\nUnited States. As Figure 2 illustrates, the three largest banks in many countries have grown, relative\nto the size of the country’s economy. What is also apparent – note the scale on the figures – is that in\nmany countries the size of the three largest financial institutions relative to the size of the economy is\nmuch larger than it is in the United States. In fact, in several countries the combined size of the\nlargest three banks is substantially larger than the GDP of the country. 4\n\nImplications for Policymakers\nWhen financial firms become large relative to the size of their home country’s economy, it can\npose significant challenges for policymakers. First, should the largest banks become troubled, there\nmay be questions as to the financial capacity of the sovereign nation to resolve these firms. Second,\neven if there is the capacity, the costs to taxpayers may be so large that there is not the political will to\ntake the steps that would ensure a non-disruptive resolution. Third, in many countries where banks\nare large relative to GDP, the largest banks have significant operations outside the national borders of\nthe home country. Fourth, most countries are likely to follow measures that protect domestic\ndepositors and borrowers relative to foreign depositors and borrowers, and will be more focused on\npreventing “collateral damage” to their own domestic economy.\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nWe care about problems at large banks because of the collateral damage caused by banks\nshrinking their balance sheet to satisfy capital requirements. As you know, loans are assets for banks.\nBanks must maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio. In times of stress banks may shrink their\nbalance sheet by tightening terms of credit – which can exacerbate problems that occur during an\neconomic downturn. 5\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, credit to business in the United States has been declining significantly\nover the past year. While loan demand does tend to fall during economic downturns, loan supply is\nalso likely to decline if banks become capital constrained. And as Figure 4 illustrates, the shrinkage\ntends to be larger at institutions with a higher probability of failure, as denoted by their supervisory\nratings. As a few financial institutions become large relative to the size of a country’s economy, the\nneed to simultaneously shrink balance sheets can have potentially serious consequences for bankdependent borrowers. Thus, large banks become important because they not only can be too big to\nfail, but also because of the potential macroeconomic consequences of shrinking. In a sense, they\nbecome “too big to allow to become troubled or constrained,” considering the impact on bankdependent borrowers.\nA natural consequence of being concerned about the domestic macroeconomic implications of\nbanking problems might be to encourage globally-active banks to expand domestically but shrink\ninternationally. This is what large Japanese banks did during the 1990s. Japanese banks significantly\nreduced their lending in the United States and Europe – which had consequences for credit conditions\nin the host countries. 6\nThus, global banks pose two significant problems for host countries.\nFirst, should the bank’s parent holding company fail, host-country operations could suffer\ncollateral damage. Host country liability holders could be disadvantaged, particularly if assets were\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ntransferred out of the host country prior to failure. Because bankruptcy and bank resolutions are\nnationally focused, the impact on host country operations could be quite uncertain.\nA second issue is the concern that global banks may export a credit crunch to countries that\nhost them. To the extent a global bank decides to reduce operations because of balance sheet\nproblems, this reduction may exacerbate other economic problems in the host country.\nIn light of these concerns, many countries are considering requiring the domestic operations of\nglobal banks that they host to be separately capitalized. This would have several potential benefits to\nthe host country. Should the global operations run into trouble, there would still be capital supporting\nthe host country operations. This would mean the host country operations would be self supporting,\nand might facilitate a sale of the operations to other owners, if needed. If the domestic regulator was\nto restrict the ability to repatriate capital to the home country, then there would be little incentive to\nshrink the host country operations – thus avoiding the potential for importing a credit crunch from the\nglobal bank to the host country.\nOf course, the cost of such a restriction is that it impedes the free flow of bank capital across\nnational borders. As a result, global banks may be less willing to expand internationally, and capital\nmay be “trapped” in countries that end up having limited economic prospects or lending\nopportunities. The cost of the inefficient use of bank capital is an area that deserves more research\nattention.\nWhether or not requiring bank operations to be separately capitalized within national borders\nmakes sense will depend, in part, on improving global resolution procedures for failing firms. If\ncountries can coordinate resolution and bankruptcy procedures, some of the costs of global bank\nfailures can be reduced. But in the absence of improved coordination, it seems quite likely that many\ncountries will decide to insulate their banking system and economy by requiring the domestic\noperations of global banks to be separately capitalized.\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nGlobal coordination is also critical if the so-called “living wills” of financial firms are to be\ndrafted and utilized. Living wills, wherein banks must detail how they would be resolved should they\nbecome troubled – or “seriously ill”, if you want to continue the living will metaphor – are a potential\nsupervisory tool that I and many others support. However, for the tool to be effective, a global bank’s\nmanagement team needs to have a clear idea of how regulators will react when a global bank becomes\ntroubled. To truly be effective, a living will for a global bank would not only require a plan\ndeveloped and kept up to date by management, but also an agreement among regulators in different\ncountries that such a plan would be feasible – since supervisory, regulatory, and legal restrictions are\ncountry dependent. In essence, in the case of global banks, living wills may serve as a mechanism to\nencourage greater synchronization of supervisory policies across countries.\nI would note, however, that there may be areas that are not easily addressed by such living\nwills. Financial institutions that are critical market makers – or who engage extensively in\ncomplicated financial contracting not involving exchanges or clearing houses – are two possible\nexamples. However, if the living will identifies these areas, the requirement could be made that they\nbe run in separately capitalized subsidiaries, where these subsidiaries hold significantly more capital\nthan other areas of the organization. Alternatively, the requirement could be made that such activities\nbe run in independent companies – as activities that are not seen as appropriate to run out of large\nglobal banks.\nEffective living wills are also likely to identify areas where banks have chosen particularly\ncomplicated legal structures – perhaps to avoid taxes, capital charges, or regulation. Complicated\nstructures that make resolution difficult impose externalities that will likely need to be addressed\ninternationally.\nThe trade-off between the commercial benefits of complicated structures and the potential\npublic costs of resolving complicated organizations is an area that deserves more supervisory and\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\ninternational study. One potential approach is to add significant Pillar Two capital under the Basel\nAccord for banks that choose complicated structures. This would essentially impose on institutions\nthat make themselves difficult to resolve a need to hold additional capital. At a minimum, living wills\nshould document the organizational purpose of different legal entities, and supervisors would have the\nability to compare those structures with competitors who have chosen simpler structures.\nA more draconian solution that has been floated by some observers is to move to narrow the\nactivities of banks. Narrowed banks would be constrained to only engage in very limited activities,\nand in particular would be banned from activities viewed as especially risky, such as proprietary\ntrading.\nPersonally I am skeptical that such dramatic action would significantly limit systemic risk,\nfor several reasons.\nFirst, even narrowly defined financial institutions can run into difficulties. One example\ninvolves money-market funds in the United States, which are very limited in their activities, and are\nonly allowed to hold highly liquid, highly rated financial instruments. Nonetheless, despite this\n“narrowness,” there was a run on prime money market funds resulting from a variety of\ninterconnected factors, which ultimately required the creation of an insurance scheme and the\nestablishment of temporary liquidity facilities – and even so, there were significant disruptions to\nshort-term credit markets, which greatly complicated financial problems in the United States last fall.\nSecond, firms that do not engage in traditional banking activities can run into difficulty and\ntransmit their problems to the broader financial system. In fact, the recent government interventions\nwere not driven by deposit insurance. The interventions were driven by concern over troubles at\nfirms so integrated in financial markets that their failure would result in financial and macroeconomic\nconsequences that would likely be unacceptable.\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nLehman Brothers did not have FDIC-insured deposits; rather it was systemically important\nbecause it was a significant counterparty to myriad financial transactions. Its failure to meet its\nobligations created uncertainty about the exposure of counterparties and the ability to complete\nfinancial transactions in a variety of markets, causing a financial market “freeze.” The need for the\nestablishment of appropriate resolution powers – and greater appreciation of the systemic risks\ncreated by investment banks that might be over-leveraged and possess too little liquidity – should be\noverall lessons drawn from the crisis.\nMoving to a narrow-bank approach is likely to merely shift the systemic risk out of banks but\nnot significantly reduce it. Large interconnected firms with extensive lending do not necessarily need\nto be financed by bank deposits, as was shown by problems at many investment banks. Instead, I\nwould advocate an alternative approach. For systemically important institutions, the risk of\ninsolvency should be reduced by requiring more capital, and requiring the institutions to build up\nlarger reserves during good times. Also, measures should be put in place that would facilitate\nsystemically important institutions obtaining and retaining capital during economic downturns. By\nhaving mandatory conversion of debt and mandatory reduction of dividends, banks could retain\nsufficient capital – so they hopefully would not need to shrink during downturns. In addition, as I\nhave argued in other talks, supervisors of such systemic institutions should have the mandated\nresponsibility and authority to address emerging systemic concerns.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nIn conclusion, I would just reiterate that the recent turmoil occurred at a time when financial\ninstitutions were becoming large relative to the size of their home country economies. The problems\nhighlighted by the financial turmoil illustrate how critical it is to address the problems of “too big to\nfail.”\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\nAs I have noted today, large institutions often are characterized by international expansion.\nGlobalization significantly complicates the ability to resolve large financial institutions. However, I\nexpect that “living wills” may be a mechanism not only to better understand the difficulties with\nresolving large complicated institutions, but also may serve as a vehicle to enhance greater\ninternational coordination, which will be crucial going forward. In addition, moving to establish a\nclear mandate for systemic regulatory responsibility is critical, as is providing the given regulatory\nentity the power to enforce that mandate.\nI thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\nNOTES\n1\n\nAlthough, certainly, some such research is being done.\n\n2\n\nI have considered the topic of systemic regulation in several recent speeches:\nIn a recent talk (“Could a Systemic Regulator Have Seen the Current Crisis?”, available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/041509.htm) I stressed that we need to have\norganizations with explicit responsibility for financial stability (charged with making sure that “contagious”\nfailures of financial institutions do not occur, and alert to trends emerging across a swath of interconnected\ninstitutions and counterparties).\nIn another talk (“Challenges in Resolving Systemically Important Financial Institutions”, available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/050509.htm), I made some observations related to the\npowers a systemic regulator would need in order to mitigate problems we have seen.\nIn another talk (“The Roles and Responsibilities of a Systemic Regulator,” available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/062909.htm), I highlighted differences between a\nmacroprudential supervisor and one focused on traditional bank-solvency oversight, touched on the\ncharacteristics that render institutions “systemically important,” and discussed some of the roles and\nresponsibilities a systemic regulator should have in order to prevent contagious failures (in particular, the\nability to supervise capital structure, liquidity risk and asset-liability management, and risk management).\nAnd in remarks at a recent panel discussion I shared my belief that the ways that financial institutions\nand markets, and financial matters such as liquidity and securitization, interact with the real economy must be\nwell understood, and worked into preventive measures and supervisory frameworks (available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/060509.htm).\n3\n\nFor example, as measured by share of GDP.\n\n4\n\nFor some countries not shown on Figure 2 – such as Iceland – the share is even higher. As of June 30,\n2008, the size of Iceland's three largest banks as a share of GDP approached 1,000 percent (specifically, 985\npercent).\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Tuesday, November 10, 2009 at 11:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time and 4:15 p.m. in London, England – or Upon Delivery *\n\n5\n\nAs I have noted in prior talks, the losses of capital and de-leveraging of balance sheets at financial\ninstitutions serve as a drag on the economy, as financial institutions focus on restructuring their balance sheets\nwith the consequent tightening of lending standards. Recall that a loan is counted as an asset on a bank's\nbalance sheet. Banks hold capital in part to reserve against the possibility that a loan defaults, and must\nmaintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its capital, it\nmust take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in order to restore its desired capital-to-assets ratio.\nThe bank becomes more restrictive in its lending – no small matter for the broader economy when you consider\nthat, thanks to leverage, when a bank's capital declines, the bank must reduce its loans by much more to\nmaintain its capital-to-assets ratio. In addition to this state of affairs, often referred to as a \"credit crunch,\" a\nnew and unwelcome wrinkle occurred in many short-term credit markets during the recent financial turmoil −\nsomething you might call a \"liquidity lock.\" By liquidity lock, I mean extreme risk aversion by many investors\nand institutions, which makes short-term financing difficult to come by for even the most creditworthy firms –\neven financing for very short maturities, measured in days.\nSee “The Impact of Financial Institutions and Financial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of\na 'Liquidity Lock'”, delivered at The University of Wisconsin – Madison in October 2008 (available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm).\n\n6\n\nJapanese banks in the 1990s tended to shrink their assets abroad, in some cases pulling out of markets\nwhere their prospects were arguably better than their prospects from additional domestic loans. See the article\nI wrote with Joe Peek, \"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United\nStates,\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOpening Remarks:\nPrevention, Containment, and Policy\nChange – Lessons from History\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s\n54th Economic Conference:\n“After the Fall – Re-evaluating\nSupervisory, Regulatory, and Monetary Policy”\n\nChatham, Massachusetts\nOctober 21, 2009\n\nGood afternoon. I’d like to welcome everyone to this conference, which is the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 54th economic conference. I’d like to thank my\ncolleagues from the Bank for their work in putting together such a dynamic and timely\nprogram.\nThe decision to move our conference to the fall came temporarily into question\nwhen it started snowing this weekend. But the weather on Sunday didn’t seem to bother\nour football team, the Patriots, and I don’t think our conference will suffer, either. The\nsnow is behind us and I think you’ll all enjoy New England in the fall.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThroughout its history, this conference has aimed to bring together policymakers,\nbusiness leaders, and academics to discuss matters of public policy. This year’s\nconference is very aptly timed, in that the nation is currently in the midst of a very\nimportant debate about what happened over the last two years and what we should do to\navoid similar problems in the future.\nI want to kick off the conference by highlighting [slide 1] some of the\nextraordinary things that have happened over the course of the last two years, and by\nsuggesting some questions we might want to address over the next two days at this\nconference. * I think everyone here is well aware that over the last two years, government\nintervention into both financial markets and financial institutions has been extraordinary.\nThere has been a major investment of taxpayer dollars in a variety of institutions. And\nthe intervention has not only involved depository institutions, but also a variety of other\ninstitutions that were seen as systemically important but did not necessarily take deposits.\nThis is a phenomenon that has occurred not only in the United States but actually\nin many corners of the globe. So while you might say “the match was struck” in the\nUnited States, the firestorm that we’ve seen over the last two years has, in many respects,\nbeen global – and policy responses have been global in nature as well.\nI would highlight [slide 2] a few of the significant “spillovers” that occurred as a\nresult of the problems that were occurring at many of the large global financial\ninstitutions. Perhaps the most striking was that previously very liquid financial markets\nessentially “seized up.” Transactions were not being done at anything near normal\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nprices, and in fact the bid-to-ask spread for many financial transactions became very\nwide.\nThe United States’ economy went into a deep and protracted recession. And we\nwere not alone. Much of the rest of the world also followed suit, in part as a result of a\nvery significant drop in international trade. Not only did the Federal Reserve reduce its\ntarget interest rate to close to zero, but so did central banks in many other parts of the\nworld. And just as our deficit has swelled, so have deficits in many other countries that\nexperienced significant problems as a result of the financial crisis.\nSo, this “financial firestorm” has raised a number of questions [slide 3] that I\nthink are appropriate to explore at this conference; among them the following:\n\n• Was this crisis preventable?\n• Could it have been better contained?\n• What are the implications for government structures?\n• What are the implications for government policies?\n• What are the implications for the global economy?\n\nNow I’d like to digress for just a moment to explore an analogy to what recently\nhappened in financial markets, drawing on a very different type of crisis that occurred\nprimarily in the 1700s and 1800s, but not since then. I think there are some broad lessons\nto be drawn from this historical example.\nAfter all, we are from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Boston is a very\nhistorical city. I want to highlight an element of that history – the second Great Boston\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFire, which occurred steps from the current Federal Reserve building. The results of the\nfire are shown in this picture [slide 4]. As you can see, the devastation was\nextraordinary, with over 700 buildings burned to the ground. It was a tragic event, with a\nlarge loss of human life. The destruction that occurred in the downtown area devastated\nthe core of the city.\nI am not an historian, but the popular histories of the Great Fire suggest a couple\nof striking thing about this tragedy. I think we do well to consider the analogies to the\ncurrent financial crisis.\nThe next slide [slide 5] highlights patterns in some of the Great Fires. The first\nthing to note is that for many of the cities that had Great Fires, the tragedies were\nrepeated. Boston had one in 1760, but roughly 100 years later, there was a second. So\nactions taken as a result of the first episode did not prevent a recurrence. This extends\nbeyond any one city, because as you can see there were a number of great fires in\nAmerican cities – and this is far from a comprehensive list. Needless to say they had\ndevastating results both in loss of human life and in loss of buildings, businesses, and\nemployment. As we contemplate the analogy, I’m sure all of us here would prefer to not\nsee a repeat of the financial firestorm of the last two years.\nNote that as you get into the mid to late 1900s you don’t see Great Fires anymore.\nWhy is this? I think there are a number of reasons, rooted in what really created some of\nthe Great Fires of the 1800s [slide 6].\nOne cause was, clearly, dangerous conditions. Buildings back then were much\nmore flammable – with either wooden structures or at least wooden roofs, as was true in\nBoston. Certain business activities added danger to that situation – for example certain\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntypes of manufacturing taking place in dense downtown areas. Policy also played a role\n– interestingly, inventories in attics were not taxed, so attics were often stuffed with very\nflammable items.\nAnother factor involves what you might call “inadequate mitigants.” We take for\ngranted out fire departments now, but fire departments in the 1800s were often\ninadequately equipped. And the water supply in American cities was quite problematic.\nIn the case of the great Boston fire the water pressure was completely inadequate to reach\nthe taller buildings that were being built, but pleas to upgrade water mains (to keep pace\nwith newer buildings) had been rebuffed. Fire hydrants had varying sized couplings, so\nthe fire brigade’s equipment didn’t fit on some hydrants.\nAnd finally, there was often insufficient enforcement of much of the fire code –\nwhile there were fire codes in place, to a large degree they were ignored.\nI’d also observe that one of the elements you read about in Great Fires seems to\nbe – to borrow a phrase from fiction – “a series of unfortunate events.” Usually there are\nsome unusual, but not unimaginable, combinations of occurrences that together escalate\nthe situation. In the case of Boston’s second Great Fire, one of the strange occurrences\nwas that all of the specially-trained fire horses had come down with an equine flu, and as\na result the fire engines had to be pulled by people, as best they could.\nSo why do we not see Great Fires in our cities anymore [slide 7]? Well, cities\nstarted to take fire prevention quite seriously. When the cities burned down, many of\nthem rebuilt in a very different way, improving their layouts to inhibit the spread of fires\nthat might emerge. Building materials improved – if you look around downtown Boston\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ntoday you don’t see wooden structures or wooden roofs. And strict enforcement of fire\ncodes emerged.\nObviously there are much improved means to try to prevent fires, and to put fires\nout should they occur. We have professionalized firefighting in our major cities. Fire\nequipment has improved dramatically. All this was sufficient to reduce significantly the\nrisk of Great Fires. Certainly there have been fires, but they haven’t had the same\ndevastating effect as in prior eras. Look again at the scene of Boston’s Great Fire [slide\n8], and then at the approximate scene today [slide 9]. What can we learn from this\nanalogy to the financial firestorms of late – and can we make as much progress in the\nfinancial realm?\nI would just highlight [slide 10] a few things that I hope we contemplate in the\ncourse of this conference.\nFirst I think we do need to do a better job of improving our ability to mitigate\nvarious crises. High on my list of things we need to attend to is to have in place\nresolution authority for all systemically-important institutions. Had we had in place such\nresolution authority, the central bank would not have had to get involved with the\nfinancial problems of individual institutions.\nWhile I don’t think the Federal Reserve should be involved in the resolution of\nindividual institutions, it’s very important that someone does have that authority. This\ncrisis would have unfolded quite differently had resolution authority been in place.\nA second question I think we ought to be discussing is whether or not we can\nsimplify the structure of many of our institutions – akin, in my analogy, to making\nbuildings less fire-prone through enforced building codes, and making fires less likely to\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nspread by instituting planning guidelines and zoning rules. There have been questions\nabout whether institutions should have what amount to “living wills” – meaning they’ve\ncome up with a plan so that if they get into financial problems, the plan for resolution is\nrelatively clear. That would probably require simplifying institutions’ structures. So, we\nshould explore the extent to which regulatory and supervisory procedures should make\nsure institutions are easy to resolve – in other words, that they have simple enough\nstructures so that if they do get into trouble you can sell parts of them without necessarily\nhaving to take them over.\nAnother area that I hope we focus on is improving some of the tools for dealing\nwith the problems. This is akin to fixing the water pressure, standardizing the hydrants,\nand ensuring that fire equipment can make it to the scene – horses or not.\nIn this vein I would mention the issue of convertible debt, which is getting quite a\nbit of attention lately. I think this is a very good idea – giving the ability to convert debt\nto equity in times of serious stress in the banking system. Also, during this crisis,\nsubstantial dividends were paid in the initial phases of the crisis at institutions that ended\nup needing significant government support. During a financial crisis it is important that\nindividual institutions as well as the banking system more generally take measures to\nretain capital. This would make it less likely that institutions need government support –\nbut also would make it less likely that banks shrink in the middle of a crisis, reducing the\ncritically important availability of credit.\nOther issues worth discussing at the conference are higher capital requirements\nfor systemically important institutions, and finding ways to build up loan loss reserves in\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 21, 2009 at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe “good times.” In addition, we need to reduce the risk that large financial institutions\nbecome illiquid during a financial crisis.\nNext [slide 11] I would argue that the appropriate institution or institutions need a\nmandate to focus on systemic risk. Mandates matter. The last two years have shown that\nwe clearly need institutions that have a focus on addressing systemic risk. With more and\nclearer focus on systemic risk, there will be more focus on identifying problems earlier\nand making sure those problems don’t become much larger over time.\nFinally, I think we should be discussing the issue of comprehensive oversight.\nThere were major gaps evident in this last crisis, which allowed risks to build up in areas\nthat were not necessarily inside regulated financial institutions. I think we need a\nmechanism whereby if we see large asset growth that’s being financed by leverage, we\nshould at least be asking questions, and there should be organizations designed to think\nabout whether these situations are posing systemic risks that we need to address.\nHopefully these and other questions will be addressed in the papers we’ll see\npresented over the next two days. This is a time where we need to re-consider some of\nwhat we’ve done and really learn the lessons from the last two years. My hope for this\nconference is that each of us will gain a number of insights – allowing those of us who\nare policymakers to better serve the public’s interests. I wish you a very engaging two\ndays.\nI hope everybody enjoys the conference, and now we’ll start with the first session.\n\n8\n\n\f1.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce:\nFinancial Services Forum\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 2, 2009\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the outlook for the economy and, in particular,\nthe possible path of inflation and the orientation of monetary policy. * In unique economic times\nlike we are experiencing, these are issues that policymakers, businesspeople, and citizens are\nrightly concerned about.\nBut before I delve into the topic, I would just like to mention how much we at the Boston\nFederal Reserve Bank enjoy having opportunities to collaborate with the Chamber, on a number\nof initiatives. For example, studies undertaken by the Chamber and the Boston Fed, focused on\nmaintaining a highly-educated work force in the region, are leading to concrete actions –\nincluding a successful event we held together for local employers’ summer interns. It was\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\ndesigned to help the interns learn about the benefits of living and working in Greater Boston after\ngraduation, with an eye to retaining their talent within the region’s workforce. My colleague\nPaul Connolly, the Bank’s Chief Operating Officer – whom many of you know well – has been a\ntrue leader on this effort, and on many others that the Bank and Chamber have pursued together.\nI want to thank him for that leadership. Paul and I and our colleagues at the Bank certainly look\nforward to future collaboration with the Chamber, to strengthen our local economy.\nWaves of financial turmoil have been with us for about two years – ever since I took this\njob, by the way – but it was about a year ago that we experienced a series of financial-market\nproblems that brought us to the brink of financial meltdown. In light of that anniversary, it is\nuseful to reflect on just how far we have come. A year ago, the stock market was in what anyone\nwould agree was a “tailspin”; short-term and highly liquid financial instruments were either not\ntrading or were trading at huge spreads over Treasury securities; and many counterparties were\nwondering whether significant financial institutions had the capacity to survive.\nOne year later, the S&P 500 Index has increased more than 50 percent from its March\nnadir, and many stock market indices around the world have staged similar recoveries, as shown\nin Chart 1. The volume of short-term interbank lending is increasing, and Chart 2 shows that\nthe interest rates banks charge each other on these loans (the Libor 1 rate) are returning to a level\nwhere the premium or “spread” relative to other financial instruments is comparable to what we\nsaw prior to the crisis. And furthermore, the stock prices of many of our major financial\ninstitutions reflect a renewed belief that they can weather their credit problems and be profitable.\nThe financial recovery has in fact led the economic recovery, which is not unusual when\nemerging from a severe recession. However, despite the very positive signs we are seeing, the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\neconomic recovery remains fragile and quite capable of falling short of the more positive\nexpectations and degrees of confidence now reflected in financial markets.\nI believe it is important that monetary and fiscal policy continue to support the economy\nuntil private-sector spending has resumed, and until we are confident that the recovery will\ncontinue once the programs that have supported the economy over the past year are removed.\nWe have historic precedent for accommodative policies that were removed too quickly, thus\nexacerbating to a significant degree the financial and economic troubles facing a nation. Today I\nam going to discuss the risk of this sort of premature policy action, in the context of a specific\nhistorical case that I studied in detail in my research career. The case involves Japan, where\npolicymakers were confronted with economic difficulties that were greatly aggravated by\nproblems in real estate, banking, and financial markets. 2\nSo this morning I intend to provide some of my own perspectives on the economy, the\nFederal Reserve’s actions, and the lessons we can draw from the Japanese experience. I hope, in\naddition, that my remarks will bolster my fundamental argument: It is essential that we\nultimately remove many of the extraordinary programs needed to fight our economic problems –\nand, by the way, many of those programs are already well on the way to being unwound – but, at\nthe same time, we need to be sure the economy continues on a path that will bring the\nunemployment rate down. And in my view, we need to see inflation return to a trajectory that is\nmore consistent with where I would like to see it settle in the longer run.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\nInflation and Monetary Policy\nI would like to begin with a few of my own perspectives on inflation, and on the\nmonetary policy actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve.\nIt is particularly striking to note the divergence we currently see among professional\nforecasters in their outlook for inflation. In stable and developed economies, inflation is\ngenerally viewed as moving relatively slowly in response to economic policies. So it is\nsurprising how divergent the views on the outlook for inflation currently are – even over\nrelatively short horizons.\nFor example, in Chart 3 we see that the forecasters in the Blue Chip survey disagree to a\nsignificant degree about inflation (measured by the consumer price index or CPI) in even the\nfourth quarter of 2010 – despite the consensus forecast that the CPI inflation rate will be about 2\npercent then. What is interesting is how wide the spread is. The ten highest inflation forecasts\naverage 3.3 percent, while the ten lowest inflation forecasts average 0.7 percent. 3\nThe CPI forecast can be influenced by assumptions on food and energy prices. But no\ndoubt the major reason for this divergence involves differences of opinion about the significant\ndrivers of inflation.\nThe forecasters that are predicting relatively low inflation over the next several years –\nand I generally share this view – highlight the importance of excess capacity in the economy.\nThese models note that the inflation rate after a recession is often well below the rate prior to the\nrecession, as you can see in Chart 4. During recessions, there are downward pressures on wages\nand salaries, and many firms find it difficult to pass on price increases. In fact, a distinctive\nfeature of the current recession has been the near disappearance of upward pressure on\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\ncompensation, as seen in Chart 5. Indeed, in my own discussions with small and medium sized\nbusinesses over the past year, it is striking how many have reported that they have cut wages and\nbenefits in lieu of further layoffs.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, many of the forecasters who expect much higher\ninflation rates have cited as a rationale the dramatic growth in the Federal Reserve balance sheet\nin response to the financial crisis, as Chart 6 shows. Just for clarity, I should note that many\nforeign central banks have taken a similar course with their own balance sheets in this crisis.\nInitially, much of the increase was related to our efforts to stabilize financial markets, last\nfall, and was designed to “automatically” diminish as the economy heals. Most of the programs\ninitiated last fall were designed to be attractive during periods of financial stress and less\nattractive (that is, quite costly for the participant) during less stressful periods – thus encouraging\nfirms to seek funds from sources other than the Federal Reserve when market conditions were\nmore normal.\nIndeed, as Chart 7 shows, Federal Reserve lending to support money market funds, the\ncommercial paper market, primary dealers, and foreign central banks grew rapidly last fall, but\nhas since fallen quite dramatically. In fact, our lending supporting money market funds and\nprimary dealers is now virtually zero, and the other two programs have shrunk quite\ndramatically. However, as these programs have wound down, the Federal Reserve has been\npurchasing mortgage-backed securities and government securities to stabilize financial markets\nand lower the cost of funds, to help promote economic growth. These purchases have added to\nour balance sheet as the shrinking of the liquidity programs has drawn it down – so that on net\nour balance sheet has remained relatively stable, and large, in recent months. As a reminder,\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\nwith the constraint of the zero nominal bound on the fed funds rate, alternative policy\ninstruments had to be examined.\n\nLessons from Japan’s Experience\nWith this background I would now like to share some observations on Japan’s experience\n– hopefully to help us narrow this difference of opinion about inflation’s trajectory and its\ndrivers. I should stress at the outset that I do not equate our situation to Japan’s, or expect us to\nfollow Japan’s path; but I do think there are insights to gain from their experience.\nThis perspective may be particularly helpful in relation to concerns about the impact of\nthe growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. The impact is hard to quantify, because we\nhave not needed to take such dramatic actions in the previous 50 years here in the United States\nor in most other advanced economies – there is simply not much historical data on a crisis like\nthis. The closest precedent to the current expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet in a\ndeveloped economy involves the actions taken by the Bank of Japan, in response to their\nfinancial crisis that began in the early 1990s.\nChart 8 shows that following the sharp decline in stock prices in Japan in 1990, the Bank\nof Japan began to lower interest rates. Interest rates were reduced quite gradually – over a fouryear period interest rates 4 moved from over eight percent to one half of one percent. 5 The\ngradual nature of this action stands in contrast to Federal Reserve policies in the recent crisis.\nThen, once the Bank of Japan had reduced interest rates to nearly zero, the Bank began using\nwhat you might call non-traditional monetary policy actions.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\nAs there were tentative signs of recovery, and because of concerns with fiscal deficits, the\nJapanese government announced a tax increase in 1997. Shortly thereafter GDP fell sharply and\nJapan went into a period of deflation that persisted for much of the past decade. Chart 9\nhighlights the fact that during that period, the Bank of Japan nearly tripled the size of its balance\nsheet. Despite the sizable expansion of bank reserves that this entailed, core consumer prices fell\nthroughout the period – with a brief pause in mid 2008. Strikingly, the CPI line is below the zero\nline on the chart for most of a decade.\nFurthermore, not only was monetary policy accommodative, but so was fiscal policy, as\nyou can see in Chart 10. The 1997 tax increase notwithstanding, the ratio of government debt to\nGDP more than doubled, and is currently more than double the rate in the United States. To be\nclear, however, I would note that Japan’s private saving has historically been much higher than\nthat of the United States.\nSo, why did Japan experience deflation despite very accommodative fiscal and monetary\npolicy? Certainly part of the story involves problems with financial institutions. Japan’s\ngovernment was famously slow to force resolution of banking problems, and many Japanese\nbanks were constrained because their capital was not sufficient to support growth in their assets. 6\nAs a reminder, loans are assets for banks, and banks are obliged to maintain a reasonable capitalto-assets ratio.\nAs Chart 11 shows, bank lending in Japan did not expand despite the sizable increase in\nthe balance sheet of the Japanese central bank. Sizable increases in bank reserves will have little\nimpact on the economy if banks are shrinking assets, which they do primarily by maintaining\ntight credit standards for lending, in order to meet capital requirements. In essence, the bank\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\nreserves sat in the banking system. Had Japanese banks been able to lend these reserves to\ncredit-worthy businesses, it would likely have spurred economic activity. 7 But dormant, un-lent\nbank reserves have little if any effect on spending – and consequently, in an environment of\nsignificant excess capacity, will do little to spur an increase in inflation.\nI see three important lessons to take from the Japanese experience:\n•\n\nFirst, taking gradual action in response to a significant asset-bubble decline may not\nbe as effective as taking more aggressive action. Thus I am pleased to note that both\nthe decrease in U.S. interest rates and the increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet have occurred over a much shorter time period than we saw in Japan.\n\n•\n\nSecond, significant expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet is not likely to be\ninflationary during a period when financial institutions are capital-constrained and\nsubstantial excess capacity exists in the economy. 8\n\n•\n\nThird, persistent problems in the financial sector may be a significant impediment to\na general economic recovery, because of the importance of credit being available to\nfinance the economic expansion.\n\nConclusion\nAnd now I’ll offer a few concluding remarks.\nBased on the historical experience with inflation in the United States and Japan, I\npersonally expect our primary short-run concern to be disinflation rather than inflation. The\ngrowth rate of the core PCE inflation index over the past year is 1.3 percent. This rate is well\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\nbelow the 2 percent rate that most members of the FOMC expect to see in the long run, as\nrevealed in their published forecasts. 9\nThere remains substantial excess capacity in the economy, and while I expect that we will\nsee positive growth in the third and fourth quarter of this year, it will not be sufficient to make\nsignificant headway in improving labor-market conditions right away. This significant excess\ncapacity in labor markets has the potential to be disinflationary at a time when the inflation rate\nis already below where we expect it to settle in the long run.\nDespite the many positive signs we are seeing in the economy, the financial markets and\nthe real economy need more time to heal. There are significant impediments to more rapid\ngrowth. Commercial real estate prices have been falling in many areas of the country, and nonperforming commercial real estate loans have been rising. Such loans are likely to be a potential\nchallenge for many of the banks that are trying to improve their balance sheets. Also, while\ncredit conditions have improved, firms and individuals with impaired balance sheets are likely to\nfind credit difficult and costly to obtain. And individuals that are still recovering from house and\nequity values well below their peaks are likely to remain slow to spend on consumer goods until\ntheir comfort with their “household balance sheet” has been restored. These challenges will\nlikely make the recovery rather restrained by historical standards, with subdued levels of\nspending and lending continuing to hold back a more rapid recovery.\nWhile many of the non-traditional approaches to monetary policy enacted to combat the\nrecession are already in the process of being removed, how quickly to further reduce the policy\naccommodation should depend on economic conditions. In particular, we need the economy to\ngrow rapidly enough that unemployment falls substantially and inflation settles at a rate near 2\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\npercent. Price stability implies that the inflation rate should not diverge significantly on the\ndownside or upside. Thus, just as policy needs to insure that inflation rate does not get too high,\nequally important is that it does not get too low. 10\nThe extraordinary economic times we have been experiencing give us all pause, and\nleave many observers with concern about policy actions and their possible outcomes. I believe,\nhowever, that despite the differences in our economies, the lessons from Japan’s experience are\nilluminating and should bring comfort that current U.S. policy is on the right path – with\nbeneficial implications for the trajectories of both inflation and economic growth.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate.\n\n2\n\nFor additional perspective see my March 2009 talk entitled “Addressing the Credit Crisis and\nRestructuring the Financial Regulatory System: Lessons from Japan”, available on the Bank’s website at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/030209.htm\n3\n\nFor the CPI inflation rate.\n\n4\n\nIn this case, the uncollateralized call rate.\n\n5\n\nIndeed, it took roughly eight years – early 1991 to early 1999 – to get to 0.25 percent.\n\n6\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The Case of\nJapan,\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, Oct. 2, 2009, at 8:15 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time – or Upon Delivery\n\n7\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation\nof Credit in Japan,\" the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166.\n\n8\n\nParticularly a large, developed economy.\n\n9\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections published with the minutes of the June 23-24 FOMC\nmeeting (http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20090624.pdf).

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nPanel Discussion\nConference on Financial Markets and Monetary Policy\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and\nthe Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking\n\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 5, 2009\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here with everyone participating in the conference, and my fellow\npanelists and Vice Chairman Kohn.1\nThe financial crisis of the last 20 months highlights the need for better understanding of\nthe links between financial intermediaries, financial markets, and the real economy. Consider\nthe fact that many models of the economy underestimated emerging problems, in part because\nthe financial links to the real economy are, in my view, only crudely incorporated into most\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmacroeconomic modeling. Indeed, most forecasters did not recognize we were in a recession in\nthe spring of 2008 even though the recession, as now dated by the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (NBER), began in December 2007. Of course this happens with recessions, but my\npoint is that even after serious problems in housing and financial markets were revealed, many\nforecasters underestimated the size, severity, and length of the downturn. In fact, many analysts\nand economists were focused on short-term inflation risks in the spring of 2008, when we were\nentering the most severe recession of the past 50 years.\nPart of the reason, I think, relates to three critical features of this crisis I would highlight\n– features, I would add, that are likely to have a long-lasting impact on financial markets and\nperhaps on how economists perceive them:\n•\n\nthe first is the increased importance of disruptions to liquidity;\n\n•\n\nthe second involves the significant changes that occurred in securitization;\n\n•\n\nthe third involves banks and their role in the economy.\n\n1. The Role of Liquidity\nLiquidity risk has received relatively scant attention in academic research. And the Basel\nII Capital Accord, which focused on a bottom-up assessment of risks at financial institutions,\nemphasized holding capital for credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. While liquidity risk\nwas acknowledged, it had no explicit treatment in “Pillar 1” of the Basel II framework, and\nreceived relatively little attention in other portions of the framework.2\nSimilarly, liquidity receives relatively little focus from most macroeconomists. While it\nis mentioned in money and banking texts, liquidity is generally characterized as a short-lived\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nproblem that can be handled by effective use of the Fed’s discount window. With most liquidity\nproblems short-lived (for example, after the September 11 terrorist attacks), liquidity did not\nreceive that much attention from most economists, financial institutions, or regulators.\nBut this crisis has been different in that there has been an extended period where bid-toask spreads have widened, where conditions have hindered buying or selling in short-term credit\nmarkets absent significant price movements, and where there has been a drying up of the ability\nto engage in various financial transactions that were formerly quite routine and markets that were\nquite active. I refer to the notion of a \"liquidity lock,\" by which I mean extreme risk aversion by\nmany investors and institutions that fear they will not be able to sell assets in a timely fashion\nwithout steep discounts.3 This makes short-term financing difficult to come by, for even\ncreditworthy firms – including financing for very short maturities, measured in days. At certain\npoints in this crisis, market participants saw few if any bids for even high-grade financial paper\nthat had a maturity greater than one day. Another manifestation was the unwillingness of many\nof the largest financial institutions to lend to each other – as represented by the very large spread\nbetween the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the overnight index swap rate.4\nThis unwillingness to take credit risk or to lend money other than overnight constrains\ncreditworthy borrowers from undertaking worthwhile projects – and thus has implications for\neconomic growth. And these disruptions have not been short-lived; even more than 20 months\ninto the crisis many markets are still not functioning as they did.\nExchange-traded markets seem to have been less disrupted than markets dominated by\ndealers. This has broader implications for market structure and potential systemic risk –\nimplications that I hope will get more attention from researchers and regulators in the future.\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA variety of financial institutions and markets are undergoing significant change as a\nresult of liquidity concerns. Considering our time today I will focus on just one example,\nchanges occurring in the money market mutual fund industry. Money market funds do not\ngenerally receive much attention. They receive short-term deposits that are then invested in\nhighly liquid short-term investments. But the size and role of the industry has probably been\nunderappreciated – at the end of the second quarter of 2007, money market funds had $2.5\ntrillion in assets, and were major holders of financial and non-financial commercial paper and\nlarge certificates of deposit (CD’s).\nFollowing the failure of Lehman Brothers, investors in some money market funds that\nheld Lehman securities began to withdraw money. Redemptions rose dramatically. Because of\nlosses on the Lehman securities, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to maintain the standard\n$1 per share current net asset value – they “broke the buck.” This had very significant\nimplications, as did the need of numerous banks to support their money market funds to avoid a\nsimilar outcome. For example, because of concern over redemptions, money market funds that\nwere still willing to purchase commercial paper wanted only very short maturities.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the overall result was a significant outflow from prime money\nmarket funds, which merited a policy response. The Treasury announced a temporary insurance\nprogram and the Federal Reserve created two liquidity facilities under its “Section 13-3”\nauthority.5 Since market participants largely viewed the programs as temporary, there have been\nsignificant shifts in the holdings of money market mutual funds. Figures 2 and 3 show that such\nfunds have shifted their composition materially, away from commercial paper and toward more\nliquid government securities. In part this represents a change in preferences of investors, who\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nhave shifted assets to government funds, and in part a change in preferences of fund managers\nseeking more liquid positions. However, the shift has disrupted the commercial paper market,\nincreasing spreads and causing some issuers to rely on the Federal Reserve’s commercial paper\nfunding facility. All in all, I suspect that the shift in money-market funds’ liquidity preferences\nis likely to have longer-term repercussions for the medium-term financing needs of firms.\nThis is just one example of how liquidity issues may have longer run implications. A\nbroader question for economists is how illiquidity could persist for so long. While this is a good\ntopic for future research, I would highlight two interrelated factors. First, much of the illiquidity\nresults from concerns with counterparty risk. Major financial firms were unwilling to trade with\nother major firms in volume, because of concerns about solvency risk – and the opaqueness of\nfirms made it difficult to ascertain their true financial health. Financial firms and regulators need\nto consider ways to make entities less opaque. Second, securitization often relied on financial\nfirms to provide liquidity and credit support, and was dependent on investor confidence in\nratings. As investor confidence in financial firms and ratings of structured products waned,\nsecuritization declined dramatically – and many markets became significantly less liquid, as\nfirms did not want to hold assets they could not securitize.\n\n2. The Role of Securitization\nTurning to a second major issue, securitization, I would note that the aforementioned\nliquidity concerns initially had their roots in credit concerns – for example, in worries about the\npotential of mortgages bundled into securities to go into default. Some of my colleagues have\nobserved that credit worries have existed for centuries – so why, this time, have credit problems\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nturned into severe liquidity stresses? I suspect that securitization has played a role, in particular\nthe rise of what I have called “surrogate securitization” (where investors were willing to buy debt\nassigned high credit ratings by rating agencies, to whom they basically delegated due diligence).6\nWith that thought, allow me to discuss securitization, where loans are pooled together\nand sold to investors. Originally, the securitization market served as a source of financing\nprimarily for home mortgages, but increasingly it was used to finance credit card receivables,\nhome equity loans, and car loans. Because assets were financed by issuing securities directly to\nthe marketplace, many assumed that securitization would provide a more resilient source of\nfinancing than depending on financial intermediaries. But ironically, the events of this crisis led\nto a state where securitization has been severely impaired, leading to increases in the cost of\nfinancing for assets that could no longer be easily securitized.\nFigure 4 shows the significant decrease in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)\noutstanding. ABCP was frequently sold to money market funds and other intermediaries\ninterested in holding short-term, high-quality paper. ABCP usually was sponsored by\ncommercial banks that provided liquidity, credit support, or both. With the onset of the crisis it\nbecame increasingly difficult for such sponsors to place their commercial paper, as potential\ninvestors became concerned about both the credit quality of the assets and the credit quality of\nsome sponsors. In addition, changes in accounting rules for off-balance-sheet conduits made this\ntype of financing less economical. As a result, ABCP issuance has significantly decreased.\nSimilarly, other types of securitization have been under severe stress. As investor\ndemand for structured finance decreased, relatively few securitizations have occurred. Figure 5\nshows the dramatic decline in securitization of home equity loans, credit card receivables,\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nstudent loans, and car loans. While there are alternatives to securitization, such as bank lending,\nthis represents a narrowing of financing sources – and in the case of bank loans, has implications\nfor capital requirements.7 Overall, the cost to borrowers is likely to go up.8\nMore research is needed on the links between banks and the securitization markets, and\nthe structure of securitization. Many securitizations are sponsored by financial institutions, and\nrely on their credit and liquidity support. As a result, securitization is not as insulated from\nbanking problems as many assumed. Also, lack of confidence in ratings has reduced investor\ndemand. In an environment where investors are less willing to rely on third- party ratings,\nsecuritizations will need more transparent structures that allow for easier monitoring of risks.\n\n3. The Role of Banks\nTurning to the role of banks, in this crisis large banks have been extended unprecedented\nsupport – extensions of deposit insurance, federal guarantees of debt, and equity infusions. The\nsupport required to alleviate the crisis suggests that clearly, financial supervision and regulation\nmust be enhanced going forward. In the limited time we have today, we cannot do justice to all\nthe lessons we should draw from recent experience, but I would like to highlight three.\nFirst, the stress tests conducted earlier this year were instructive to banks and supervisors.\nSome banks had difficulty providing the data needed as inputs to the tests – data that would\nideally exist as inputs to robust budgeting and risk-management systems. Thus, like the crisis\nitself, the stress tests highlighted shortcomings in management information systems and data.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nBecause the stress-tests were done simultaneously across institutions, using the same\nassumptions, it was possible to compare results – and, indeed, to observe differences in\ninstitutions’ ability to undertake a rigorous test. Previously supervisors did conduct comparative\nexercises (called horizontal reviews), but the sequential nature of those exercises (that is, their\noccurrence in different time periods) made it more difficult to compare results across institutions.\nThe stress tests provide a top-down assessment of capital, based on economic\nassumptions – and thus provide a very good complement to the bottom-up risk assessment that is\nthe cornerstone of most risk-management frameworks at major banks and is the cornerstone of\nthe Basel II Capital Accord. In addition, making the results public allowed outside investors to\n“bound” the likely losses at financial institutions, even considering the more dire outlook\n(compared to the base forecast of many) that was part of the stress tests. This ultimately helped\nfinancial institutions raise additional capital at a critical juncture for the economy.9\nA second area that should be considered is the role of debt. A variety of debt instruments\nare issued by banks and qualify as capital for institutions’ capital requirements, and the use of\nsubordinated debt has been advocated by some economists. However, the reluctance to require\ndebt to be converted to equity, or to shoulder more of the losses, should cause us to reexamine\nthe role of debt in systemically important institutions. A number of proposals exist, but one\npossibility for reform would be to establish that debt instruments could be used to meet capital\nrequirements only if they have automatic triggers to convert to common equity under certain\ncircumstances.10 While such instruments would not likely be attractive in the current\nenvironment, they may find acceptance once the economy and financial markets have recovered.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA third area involves the off-balance sheet operations of banks. Many large banks are\nmarket makers in assets held off of balance sheets. This has resulted in banks having very\nsizeable positions in derivatives instruments relative to their capital positions. In addition, banks\nhad significant positions in structured investment vehicles and conduits that had much more risk\nthan many financial institutions and their supervisors thought prior to the crisis. Examination\nand understanding of the role of off-balance sheet activities deserves significantly more\nsupervisory attention, going forward. It will be important to ensure that capital held for offbalance sheet exposures is commensurate with the risk that they pose.\n\nConcluding Observations\nAllow me to close with a few concluding observations. This crisis highlights the\nimportant role of financial institutions and markets on the real economy. In my view this is an\narea that does not receive sufficient attention in research, or in the teaching of economics.\nThe contributions of financial institutions and markets to the length and severity of this\nrecession are likely to be a topic of research well into the future. However, given the extent of\ngovernment intervention that has been necessary, more preventive measures must be considered.\nReform efforts will need to consider appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures to\ninsure that financial markets can efficiently allocate capital without placing the economy, and\ntaxpayers, at this degree of risk again. To accomplish this, I would suggest that lawmakers and\npolicymakers will need to keep in mind the complex but undeniable way that financial markets, financial\ninstitutions, and financial matters such as liquidity and securitization interact with the real economy. And\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthis, I firmly believe, means the Federal Reserve can and must play an integral role in the financial\nregulatory framework in the United States.\n\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nSee http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/07-5729.htm.\n\n3\n\nI explored this topic in a speech at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, entitled “The Impact\nof Financial Institutions and Financial Markets on the Real Economy: Implications of a 'Liquidity Lock'”,\navailable at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/100908.htm.\n\n4\n\nNote that this liquidity lock, where transactions are impeded by severe risk aversion by potential\ninvestors, compounds problems created by a traditional credit crunch – a situation in which institutions\nseek to shrink assets (like loans) in order to meet regulatory or market-imposed capital-to-assets ratios. In\nthe recent crisis, not only were financial firms faced with a need to de-lever (thus, a credit crunch), but\nthey were also finding it increasingly difficult to borrow other than overnight – even if they were an\norganization that was highly rated (…thus, a liquidity lock).\n\n5\n\nSection 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act allows the Federal Reserve “In unusual and exigent\ncircumstances … to discount for any individual, partnership, or corporation…” See\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section13.htm.\n\n6\n\nUtilizing ratings to help evaluate the riskiness of securities is a normal part of the securitization\nprocess. But when new securities arise, investors may need to exercise more caution as rating agencies\nthemselves learn about the appropriate risk to attach to the new instruments. I discussed this in more\ndetail in several talks, including “Recent Developments in Real Estate, Financial Markets, and the\nEconomy” available at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2007/101007.htm.\n\n7\n\nBank lending where the loan is held as an asset on the bank’s balance sheet has implications for\ncapital requirements, which focus on maintaining an acceptable capital-to-assets ratio.\n\n8\n\nThe Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) has been an effort by the Federal\nReserve to “reopen” the securitization market. While the TALF program was complicated to start, it has\nhelped reduce interest spreads on asset-based securities, and some new asset-based securities are being\nissued.\n9\n\nFollowing the May 7 release of the results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program\n(SCAP), the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies have raised $59.1 billion in capital, including $50.4\nbillion through stock offerings and $8.7 billion through asset sales. The ten firms needing to augment\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, June 5, 2009 at 2:45 P.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Worcester Economic Club\nWorcester, Massachusetts\nMay 21, 2009\n\nThank you for inviting me to join you this evening to talk about recent economic trends\nand prospects for recovery.1 As you know all too well, the economy has been in the throes of a\nparticularly long and severe recession. The national unemployment rate has more than doubled\nfrom its low of 4.4 percent before the “peak” of the business cycle. All of us in this room are\nwell aware of the toll on individuals and households brought by job losses, so this is indeed\nsobering.\nHowever, incoming data have been mixed of late – rather than solely negative – and the\nstock market has improved significantly from its low point in March. After two quarters where\nreal GDP shrank by more than 6 percent,2 I expect that the economy will contract by much less\nthan that this quarter, and that we will begin to see positive growth – perhaps by the end of the\nyear.\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe severity of the recession has led both fiscal and monetary policymakers to implement\naggressive responses. The Federal Reserve acted aggressively on the monetary front, and the\nAdministration and the Congress on the fiscal front with the stimulus legislation. While these\npolicies will still take some time to have their full impact, they are in my view part of the reason\nthe rate of decline in the economy seems to be slowing.\nCertainly any near-term recovery is predicated on continued healing of the financial\nmarkets and financial system that underpin the economy. This is an outcome that is hoped for,\nand that policymakers are working intently to ensure, but not yet a certainty.\nNonetheless I hope the debate will soon center on the nature of the recovery, rather than\nthe severity of the recession. It is a positive sign that some analysts are beginning to speculate\non the likely nature of an economic recovery – and, indeed, that a talk focused on aspects of\nrecovery is now quite relevant.\nCertainly a wide range of views have been expressed, with references to L, U, and V\nshaped recessions. While I am at heart very much an optimist, my own view of the situation is\nthat due to some unusual features of this recession the economy is likely to experience a slow\nrecovery. I’ll mention these features briefly, and then explore them with you in a bit more detail.\n•\n\nFirst, while the “financial freeze” has thawed quite a bit, it will take some time for\ncomplete normalization of financial markets and lending.\n\n•\n\nSecond, consumers’ “balance sheets” have been under significant strain, in part due to a\nloss in household wealth, and improvements will take some time.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n•\n\nThird, a related point: the very sharp decline in housing prices is likely to inflict some\nforms of “collateral damage.” Labor market mobility is likely to be hampered, financing\nfor homes is likely to be restrained, and the ability to use home equity to finance various\nprojects will be limited.\n\n•\n\nFourth, the economic health of key trading partners remains somewhat fragile, so it\nwould be unwise to expect much help in the form of foreign growth that would propel our\nexport-led industries.3\nConsidering these issues and taking into account the current level of fiscal and monetary\n\npolicy stimulus, my best judgment is that a rather slow recovery is likely. Unfortunately, such a\nforecast implies continued weakness in the labor market, and an unemployment rate that\ncontinues to rise through this year.\nWith significant growth in payroll employment unlikely until next year it will obviously\nand unfortunately be some time before we see labor markets return to what we think of as “full\nemployment.” And it is too soon to know when the trough of the recession will occur, although\nthere are hopeful signs that we are nearing it.\n\nThe Employment Situation\nAllow me to make a few observations on the employment situation. As Figure 1\nhighlights, we are in the midst of a severe recession. Since the official onset of the recession in\nDecember 2007, on net, 5.7 million American jobs have been lost.4\nWhile the 1973-75 and 1981-82 recessions brought peak unemployment rates above our\ncurrent level, in these and other recessions it is important to consider not just the peak level of\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment but also the level at the beginning of the recession, and thus the percentage point\nincrease during the downturn. Consider Figure 2. From the official start of this recession in\nDecember 2007, the unemployment rate has risen by 4 percentage points – a percentage-point\nincrease from the start of the recession that already exceeds what we saw in the last three\nrecessions. And the unemployment rate is quite likely to continue to climb, although I hope at a\nmuch slower pace than in previous months.\nLabor markets tend to be somewhat lagging indicators.5 So the expectation that the\neconomy will grow below its potential for the rest of this year suggests that the unemployment\nrate will likely rise through this year – even if we get to a state of slow positive growth in the\neconomy later this year.\nFigure 3 provides the peak-to-trough changes in several of the components of real GDP.\nSeveral patterns are apparent. First is the important role played by residential investment. While\nresidential investment accounts for a relatively small share of GDP, it is a volatile component. In\nthree of the past four recessions, residential investment has seen the sharpest decline of the\ncomponents of GDP shown in the chart. Only the 2001 recession did not have declines in\nresidential investment from peak to trough, primarily because that recession involved imbalances\nin corporate balance sheets partly triggered by the rapid investment in the “dot-com” boom.6\nOne reason residential investment is so volatile is that it is the component of GDP most\nsensitive to changes in interest rates. The housing sector tends to be disproportionately impacted\nby rising interest rates, which typically occur when monetary policymakers are working to\nprevent increases in the inflation rate.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHowever, this residential investment cycle has been different. Mortgage interest rates\nhave remained relatively low, but residential investment has declined sharply as significant oversupply in some key areas has led to rapidly falling housing prices, which provide a strong\nincentive to postpone a home purchase. This time falling house prices, coupled with rising\nunemployment rates (rather than interest rate increases) have been the main housing drivers.\nWhile the decline in residential investment from peak to trough has been much more\nsevere during this recession than the previous three downturns, as shown in Figure 3, this\nactually understates the decline for two reasons. First, residential investment was falling well\nbefore the official start of the recession. The decline in residential investment began in the first\nquarter of 2006, while the official start to the recession was not until December 2007. Second,\nwe remain uncertain about the date of the trough of the recession, although it seems that it most\ncertainly will not be the end of the first quarter of this year.\nAlso notable in this recession has been the decline in business fixed investment.\nParticularly since the fall of last year, businesses have reacted quite aggressively to the\nslowdown in economic activity. Not only have they moved to reduce overall costs by reducing\nexpenditures for labor, but they have also slashed their investment budgets.7\nFurther, exports have declined sharply during this downturn, as they have in three of the\npast four recessions. But once again, the decline in exports to date likely understates the ultimate\nsize of the decline – because we have likely not yet reached the trough of this recession, and\nforeign economies have been weakening rather rapidly since the start of the year.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nEconomic Recovery\nFigure 4 highlights the recovery in several components of the economy in the first year\nfollowing the trough of a recession. Several interesting patterns appear. In the previous three\nrecoveries, the housing sector has shown the largest percentage change among the components of\nGDP shown in the figure. This largely reflects that this interest-sensitive component is usually\nbuoyed by the reductions in interest rates that are the normal monetary policy response to\nrecessions. This is why many analysts have highlighted the importance of seeing the bottom of\nthe housing market for the economy to begin a true recovery.\nAnother important point related to recovery is that consumption needs to grow. While\nthe percent change in consumption looks small in the figure relative to some of the other\ncomponents, it is important to remember that consumption is by far the largest component of\nGDP. Because consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, these percent changes\nare on a large base. In short, it is very difficult to have a recovery without consumers being\nwilling to spend, which was a motivation for some of the fiscal stimulus being directed towards\nincreasing consumption.\nIn contrast, business fixed investment is not usually the driver in the initial stages of the\nrecovery, as businesses are hesitant to hire more workers and make further investments until the\nrecovery is more firmly established. Government spending also plays a role in recovery, as you\ncan see in Figure 4. Certainly in the current recession, policymakers hope the stimulus spending\nwill play a role. Furthermore, exports normally grow during the initial stages of a recovery.\nThis is why it is important to us that policymakers worldwide respond to a recession that is\nclearly global.\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nImpediments to a Recovery\nNormally forecasters are slow to recognize a recovery. Just as economic models usually\ndo not foresee the depth of economic problems at the onset of a recession, most models miss the\nspeed of the recovery. Thus, while I do indeed expect the recovery to be slow, I am well aware\nof the perils in making such a forecast – given the forecast errors often made at this time of the\ncycle. Still, while every recession has its unique features, this recession has involved larger\nimpacts on our economic and financial infrastructure than others – a fact that makes my outlook\non the speed of this recovery rather subdued.\nThe first major impediment is the financial infrastructure. While we have seen some\nimprovements in financial firms’ stock prices, and a generally positive response to the banking\nindustry’s so-called “stress tests,” financial institutions and financial markets are still recovering\nfrom recent turmoil. As is shown in Figure 5, despite recent improvements, bank stock prices\nremain well below their cyclical peak, and the decline in bank stock prices has been more severe\nin this recession than in the previous one.\nContinued healing of financial institutions requires recapitalization and full recognition\nand disposal of problem assets. While there have been significant steps taken to recapitalize\nmany financial institutions, there has been slower movement towards removal of problem assets\nfrom financial institutions’ balance sheets (although the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment\nProgram is intending to address this). Unfortunately, countries that have experienced significant\nbanking problems normally have a slower economic recovery, as bank lending improves only\nslowly while banks remain risk-averse and work to repair their balance sheets.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nIt is not only financial institutions that have been damaged; many short-term credit\nmarkets have been badly disrupted by recent events. While the commercial paper market and\nmoney market funds have shown some improvements – in part as a result of Federal Reserve\nlending facilities – short-term credit is still difficult to access for many firms. Similarly, while\nwe are beginning to see some financing for securitization of assets, the securitization market is\ndramatically smaller than before the recession. A full economic recovery requires that financial\nmarkets as well as financial institutions return to their role of efficiently allocating financing.\nA second significant impediment is the amount of wealth lost during this downturn, as\nshown in Figure 6. Not only has the decline in the stock market been particularly severe, with\nmany people reluctant to look at their monthly 401K statements, but our housing wealth has also\ndeclined significantly as housing prices have fallen – making the real estate pages a section of\nthe Sunday paper many want to avoid. Because of the large loss in wealth implied by these two\ndynamics, it is likely that consumers will be slower to spend during this recovery as they seek to\nbalance their saving behavior to reflect their loss in wealth.\nA ramification of this loss in wealth is less access to consumer financing. With home\nequity lower or gone, it is no longer a source of financing for many consumers. In addition, the\nfinancial stress created by this recession has impaired the credit rating of many consumers,\nmaking credit less available and more costly for many borrowers. In addition, many potential\nhome buyers are finding that if they want to buy a house, lenders are requiring higher down\npayments, better credit ratings, and more income in relation to debt. While housing credit was\nby most accounts too readily available several years ago, the current environment is likely to be\nparticularly challenging for first-time home buyers and those with modest incomes.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFurthermore, Americans have tended to be much more mobile than residents in many\nother countries. As a result, job seekers could move to those regions of the country most in need\nof additional workers during an economic recovery. This labor flexibility is important if\ndifferent regions and different industries recover at different paces. However, during this\nrecovery low house prices and low housing demand may make individuals reluctant to move, as\nit would require them to lock in losses on their houses – particularly if the selling price is likely\nto be below the value of the loan.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThis recession has been long and severe. While we are beginning to see more mixed\neconomic data, which are likely a harbinger of a trough in this recession, the economy and\nfinancial markets remain quite sensitive to additional shocks. While problems in financial\ninstitutions and financial markets have abated from last fall, the recovery is likely to be impeded\nuntil there is greater normalization in financing flows.\nI believe the aggressive monetary and fiscal response to the crisis has no doubt helped\nprovide the foundation for an economic recovery. While I expect in the absence of significant\nfurther shocks that we will begin to see positive economic growth towards the end of this year,\nthat growth is not likely to be robust enough to provide much improvement in labor markets until\nnext year.\nI want to stress, however, that I anticipate that actions taken to stabilize financial markets\nand institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., May 21, 2009 at 7:45 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nresumption of sustainable growth. Furthermore the Federal Reserve has been and will remain\ncommitted to employing all available tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price\nstability.\nFinally, as the recovery begins, it will be critical to fully evaluate the lessons of this\nrecession, so we can make our economy, our financial markets, and our regulatory environment\nmore resilient and less susceptible to the shocks that have impacted us all. Hopefully the start of\nthe recovery will be an appropriate time to begin that process, in earnest.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nThese quarterly rates of decline are seasonally adjusted at annual rates.\n\n3\n\nAlthough of late, while exports have dropped, imports have fallen even more – so the contribution of net\nexports to GDP has been positive.\n\n4\n\nFor reference, the situation in New England and Massachusetts is similar to that in the nation, although\nthe unemployment rate is a bit lower. Job losses have not been quite as severe, but that is because the\ndecline got started a bit later. Rhode Island currently has an unemployment rate that is the highest in New\nEngland, and sixth highest in the nation. However, at the end of 2008, Rhode Island was second highest,\nafter Michigan. Since then, things have gotten worse in Rhode Island, but worse still in other states.\n\n5\n\nThe lag is very small for payroll employment – perhaps a month. Unemployment’s lag is about three\nmonths.\n\n6\n\nIt was also one of the few times inflation was low going into the recession. The Federal Reserve was\nnot trying to dampen inflationary pressures with higher rates.\n\n7\n\nIt could be that disruptions in credit flows to businesses stemming from the financial turmoil also played\na role.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 1\nUnemployment Rate\nJanuary 1959 - April 2009\n\nPercent, Seasonally Adjusted\nPercent\n12\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nJan-59\n\nJan-67\n\nRecession\n\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\nJan-75\n\nJan-83\n\nJan-91\n\nJan-99\n\nJan-07\n\n\fFigure 2\nMonthly Change in Unemployment Rate from\nStart of Recession\nOver Three Years Following Start of Last Four Recessions\n\nPercentage Point Change from Start of Recession\n5\nUnemployment Rate at\n2007 Recession\nStart of Recession\nJuly 1981\n7.2%\n4\nJuly 1990\n5\n5.5%\n5%\n1981 R\nRecession\ni\nMar 2001\n4.3%\n3\nDec 2007\n4.9%\n1990 Recession\n2\n1\n\n2001 Recession\n\n0\n-1\n1\n\n6\n\n11\n\n16\n\n21\n\nMonths from Start of Recession\nSource: BLS, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n26\n\n31\n\n36\n\n\fFigure 3\nP kt T\nPeak-to-Trough\nh Changes\nCh\niin R\nReall GDP C\nComponents\nt\nLast Four Recessions\n\nPercentt Change\nP\nCh\n5\n-5\n-15\n-25\n\nConsumption\nResidential Fixed Investment\n\nBusiness Fixed Investment\nExports\n\n-35\n1981:Q3 -1982:Q4\n1982:Q4\n\n1990:Q3 -1991:Q1\n1991:Q1\n\n*Change through 2009:Q1, trough not defined.\nSource: BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n2001:Q1 -2001:Q4\n2001:Q4\n\n2007:Q4 -2009:Q1\n2009:Q1*\n\n\fFigure 4\nRecovery in Real GDP Components:\nChange 1 Year from Trough\nLast Three Recoveries\n\nPercent Change from Trough (Year Earlier)\n50\nConsumption\nResidential Fixed Investment\nGovernment\n\n40\n30\n\nBusiness Fixed Investment\nExports\n\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n1982:Q4 - 1983:Q4\n\nSource: BEA, NBER / Haver Analytics\n\n1991:Q1 - 1992:Q1\n\n2001:Q4 - 2002:Q4\n\n\fFigure 5\nKBW Bank Index\nJune 1992 - April 2009\n\nMonth-end Close\n140\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n07\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n03\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n30-Jun-92\n30\nJun 92\n\n30-Jun-95\n30\nJun 95\n\n30-Jun-98\n30\nJun 98\n\n29-Jun-01\n29\nJun 01\n\n30-Jun-04\n30\nJun 04\n\n29-Jun-07\n29\nJun 07\n\nRecession\nNote: The KBW Bank Index comprises 24 major banks (money center banks and leading regional banks)\nchosen to reflect the financial sector.\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\fFigure 6\nHousehold Wealth: Net Worth of Households and\nNonprofit Organizations\n1959:Q1 - 2008:Q4\n\nPercent Change from Year Earlier\n20\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n-10\n\n0\n\n-20\n20\n59:Q1\n\n65:Q1\n\n71:Q1\n\n77:Q1\n\nRecession\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n83:Q1\n\n89:Q1\n\n95:Q1\n\n01:Q1\n\n07:Q1\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Institute of Regulation and Risk North Asia\n\nHong Kong\nMay 5, 2009\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you this evening. The events of the last year and three-quarters have\nbrought matters of regulation and risk – your Institute’s focus – to the top of the list of concerns for\nnational and international policymakers.1 Thank you for inviting me to share these remarks and\nparticipate in the panel discussion to follow.\nIn the past year, crises and resulting failures of a number of large internationally active\nfinancial firms have rippled across and weakened the global economy. Events demonstrated the\nglaring absence of resolution powers in the United States – except in the case of banks – and\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\ndemonstrated the limited ability of U.S. authorities to intervene in troubled non-depository financial\ninstitutions, at least before the passage of the TARP legislation.\nThis state of affairs left the United States lacking the tools to smoothly address the failures of\n“systemically important” institutions – those whose disorderly failure could potentially lead to a drop\nin confidence in the global banking system, seize-ups in credit markets, the collapse of other financial\ninstitutions, and worsening economic conditions. 2 Many others, including Chairman Bernanke, have\nnoted the urgent need to address the lack of resolution authority.3 Of course, difficulties dealing with\nfinancial troubles in several European countries have shown that the United States is not alone.\nSo clearly, the role played by financial institutions in the current crisis has laid bare the need\nto rethink how systemically important financial institutions should be regulated and, if they fail, how\nthey should be resolved. As you know, policymakers in the U.S. and many other countries are right\nnow working through the intricate and challenging issues associated with creating a more effective\nregulatory structure, making forums like this both timely and important.\nIn a recent talk,4 I expressed my view that we need to have organizations with explicit\nresponsibility for financial stability (that is, charged with making sure that “contagious” failures of\nfinancial institutions do not occur, and alert to trends emerging across a swath of interconnected\ninstitutions and their counterparties5). I argued in that talk that a regulator explicitly charged with\naddressing financial stability probably could have spotted some of the financial trends leading up to\nthe crisis. In my remarks today, I would like to make some observations related to questions about\nthe powers a systemic regulator would have needed in order to mitigate some of the problems we\nhave seen.\nAs you consider the perspectives I share this evening, I encourage you to keep at the back of\nyour mind the scale of these regulatory challenges. In the end we need to be able to address these\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\ncomplex questions, and adequately empower those in the systemic-regulatory and resolution roles. If\nwe cannot, we will do well to find other ways to limit systemic risks.\nIn particular I will focus on the need for a systemic regulator to be able to address firms’\nglobal operations, and the increased use of financial derivatives. These are key issues because\nfinancial institutions are likely to have a larger global presence over time, and to be more active in\nfinancial derivatives. Both trends represent the normal outgrowth of globally integrated economies\nand financial markets, and are not necessarily unwelcome or unhealthy. But the critical point is that\nthe roles and powers of supervisors and regulators have not kept up with these developments.\nAllow me to make one important distinction at the outset. My remarks today touch on both\nsystemic regulation and on the resolution of systemically important institutions. Clearly these roles\ncould be carried out by either one entity or by two separate entities – a systemic regulator and a\nresolver of systemically important institutions. My remarks touch on both functions, while for\nsimplicity I tend to refer in my own shorthand to a “systemic regulator” – but the distinction is\nimportant.\n\nResolution of Systemically Important Institutions\nThe financial crisis has highlighted the pressing need for better resolution procedures. For\nbanking organizations, the FDIC has the ability to place banks under receivership without going\nthrough bankruptcy proceedings. However, these resolution powers apply only to banks, not other\nnon-bank financial firms, and do not apply to bank holding companies.\nThe resolution power of the FDIC allows the FDIC to conduct an orderly resolution of the\nbank, which protects depositors and provides the least-cost solution to the government. In the case of\nbank holding companies and non-depository financial institutions, insolvency must be addressed in\nbankruptcy court. Unfortunately, bankruptcy procedures are designed to provide a clear priority\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\namong creditors, but do not provide any special provisions for an insolvency that has broad systemic\nimplications. In such situations, it is very possible that a preferable public policy would be to\nminimize systemic implications rather than follow the normal creditor priority set out in the\nbankruptcy code.\nConsider this argument in relation to the Lehman Brothers failure. The government lacked\nany resolution powers in the case of investment banks, and Lehman had no immediate merger\npossibilities, so Lehman was forced to file for bankruptcy. The Lehman failure had broad\nimplications for the financial system and economy. The firm was internationally active, engaged\nactively in derivatives contracts, and a counterparty to many other financial institutions. Figure 1,\nwhich shows legal proceedings resulting from the Lehman bankruptcy filing, is instructive.\nHad there existed the authority and procedures to resolve Lehman outside of bankruptcy\nproceedings, there may have been a much more orderly “wind down” of Lehman’s operations. Of\ncourse, the Lehman failure suggests that even with resolution powers in place this would have been a\nvery challenging situation – Lehman would have been difficult to wind down, in part because of the\nscope of its global operations.\nLehman Brothers operated in over 40 countries and had over 650 distinct legal operating\nentities outside of the United States. While there were many separate legal entities outside of the\nUnited States, the firm was managed globally — meaning many of its risk management and operating\nplatforms stretched across its many distinct entities.\nIn the event Lehman Brothers had been placed in receivership in the United States, it is\nunclear how Lehman’s operations outside the United States would have been treated in foreign\njurisdictions. In such situations it is possible that a country would try to “ring fence” assets so that\nliability holders in the country would be paid prior to returning funds to a foreign parent.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\nSuch a situation raises a number of interesting questions concerning the role of a systemic\nregulator. I would like to provide my own perspective on some of these questions – “straw man”\napproaches, if you will:\n\n•\n\nFirst, for globally active and systemically important U.S. institutions, I suspect that the\npotential disruptions to operations associated with ring fencing will likely mean that capital\nsupport of foreign operations (that is, capital injections) will be a critical part of the resolution\nprocedures. As a consequence, the systemic regulator would need to have the power to inject\ncapital or request that the Treasury inject capital.\n\n•\n\nSecond, given the speed with which failures have occurred, it may be difficult to incorporate\nlegislative oversight of the resolution process in the short-term – so an understanding of such\narrangements should be worked out between Congress and the systemic regulator.\n\n•\n\nThird, international agreements on receivership procedures for globally active institutions will\nbe necessary. What institutions or agencies will have a role in negotiating these procedures? I\ncertainly believe that a systemic regulator should have a role.\n\n•\n\nFourth, I would note that policymakers will have to sort out the appropriate uses of\nconservatorship (operating the bank as a going concern) versus receivership (which has the\ngoal of liquidation) in the case of systemically important institutions.\n\n•\n\nFifth, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require reductions in foreign exposures as a\nsystemically important financial institution encounters problems. This might include the\nability to require that foreign subsidiaries and branches be sold to avoid broader systemic\nproblems, as financial problems increase.\n\n•\n\nSixth, perhaps the systemic regulator will need to be able to influence the “home/host” rules\nthat govern the division of labor in the supervision of internationally active firms.\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\n•\n\nSeventh, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require higher capital requirements for\nglobally active financial institutions that will be difficult to resolve if they become insolvent.\n\nBeyond these challenges related to global operations, a second problem highlighted by the\ncrisis is the difficulty in managing the derivatives book of global financial institutions. While\nderivatives contracts were a problem in the case of Lehman’s failure, they were particularly acute in\nthe case of American International Group (AIG). Because of the presence of complicated, interrelated\nfinancial contracts the unwinding of the derivatives positions of AIG has been costly and time\nconsuming.\nIncreasingly, derivatives and other forms of structured finance are inherent in the operations of\nlarge global financial institutions. However, the presence of a small number of global financial\ninstitutions as significant counterparties or dealers in the derivatives markets has made such\ninstitutions very difficult to resolve, whether through bankruptcy or through receivership. This raises\nseveral interesting issues and questions, which I will provide my own current views on:\n\n•\n\nFirst and very importantly, I believe a systemic regulator should have the ability to require that\ntransactions be moved to an exchange as the contract becomes standardized and widely used.\n\n•\n\nSecond, I believe that in finding the most efficient way to resolve complicated financial\ntransactions in the event a major player becomes insolvent, the systemic regulator would need\nthe ability to explore whether bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, or governmental\nequity ownership would provide the best model for resolving complicated financial\ntransactions that affect a large number of financial institutions around the globe.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\n•\n\nThird, a systemic regulator may need the ability to require financial institutions to reduce their\nderivatives exposure as they become financially troubled. This might include the ability to\nrequire the selling of broker or dealer operations in major markets as a firm’s financial\nposition deteriorates.\n\n•\n\nFourth, a systemic regulator will likely need the ability to require higher capital requirements\nfor firms that are active counterparties or dealers in complicated financial products.\n\nFuture Resolution Challenges\nWhile the problems of 2008 highlighted the difficulty of resolving financial institutions with\nlarge global operations and active involvement in derivatives, these problems are likely to be even\nmore important in the future. Figure 2 highlights the importance of foreign banking operations for\nU.S. commercial banks. Looking forward, as more and more customers of financial institutions are\neither global themselves, or have supply lines and sales channels that are global, they will expect their\nfinancial institutions to have global operations. U.S. banks that are internationally active hold 18\npercent of assets in foreign offices. Over time, foreign operations seem more likely to grow than\ncontract in an increasingly global economy.\nAs U.S. financial institutions become more involved around the globe, it is likely that these\ninstitutions will become more important in their host countries and more difficult to resolve should\nthey become financially troubled. In this regard, I would suggest the following about some of the key\nissues that will emerge:\n\n•\n\nFirst, a key issue will involve the willingness of home and host countries to supervise and,\nmore importantly, potentially bear the burden of financially supporting the operations of a\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\nlarge and systemically important financial institution, if it becomes troubled. This could alter\nwhat we have traditionally seen as the roles of home and host supervisors.\n•\n\nSecond, it will be important to determine how best to structure U.S. financial firms abroad, to\nminimize the potential for disruption if the firm becomes insolvent.\n\nOf course, foreign firms have significant involvement in the U.S. economy. Figure 3 shows\nthe share of U.S. bank assets held by foreign owners. British, Canadian, German, and Swiss banks all\nhave a major presence in the United States. Some foreign banks operate large subsidiaries in the\nUnited States; others have very large branch operations. As a result, if the parent company has\nfinancial problems, it can have a downstream impact on the U.S. economy. Should foreign banks\nshrink as a result of financial problems, U.S. borrowers may find it more difficult to secure financing.\nThis too raises several questions, about which I observe the following:\n\n•\n\nFirst, it will be important to determine whether there should be a preference for branch versus\nsubsidiary structures in systemically important institutions.\n\n•\n\nSecond, where the financial institutions are large relative to the size of the home country, there\nwill need to be expectations and obligations of the home country. How explicit these should\nbe will need to be determined. We should note that in some countries, systemically important\nfinancial institutions figure very prominently in the country’s economy – more so, in relation\nto the country’s GDP, than any one U.S. financial institution does in relation to U.S. GDP.\n\nDerivatives contracts have become increasingly important for financial institutions – to\nsupport their customers, to serve as brokers or dealers, and to hedge their own positions. Over time,\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\nthe size of the gross derivatives positions of the five largest commercial banking organizations most\nengaged in derivatives activity has become quite large relative to their assets (Figure 4). These\npositions are likely to get larger over time, and substantial derivatives operations are likely to be\nimportant for more and more financial institutions. Given their complexity and likely growth, we\nneed to explore the implications for bank regulation and the role of a systemic regulator, and indeed to\nbetter understand their potential impact.6\n\nConcluding Observations\nGreater integration of the world economy and financial markets is both desirable and\ninevitable. However, our ability to manage insolvency risk of key players has not grown with these\ndevelopments. The presence of globally active financial institutions involved in derivatives\noperations world-wide requires a major rethinking of how we supervise and regulate systemically\nimportant institutions. Until global resolution policies are adopted, resolution of internationally active\norganizations will remain problematic.\nBoth issues I have discussed today – global activity and derivatives involvement – would be\nimportant for any regulator charged with systemic responsibilities. Of course, a systemic regulator\nwill need to consider many other issues besides the two I have highlighted today – including issues\nlike leverage, liability management, and securitization – but given the constraints on time these\nadditional issues will have to be a topic for another day.\nBankruptcy laws and resolution procedures are national. Home country financial supervisors\nhave a national focus, and bank regulations apply within the firms’ national borders. However, as\nfinancial firms increasingly span national borders, much greater coordination is necessary.

In some countries the focus of financial institution resolution has seemingly been the\nprotection of government-run deposit-insurance programs – a local mindset at odds with a potentially\nglobal issue. Increasingly their attention will need to focus on potential systemic problems with\nglobal ramifications.\nI hope my remarks today have provided a sense of the urgency, and also the complexity, of\nthese issues. I have given my own views on some of the key questions that policymakers must\nultimately consider. I’ll conclude by noting that the complexity of these issues makes it no less\nimportant that we address them, for the good of all participants in our economies.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n2\n\nIn remarks on April 14, 2009, Chairman Bernanke noted that “Large, complex financial institutions tend to be\nhighly interconnected with other firms and markets... For example, AIG… [A] disorderly failure of AIG would have put at\nrisk not only the company's own customers and creditors but the entire global financial system. Historical experience\nshows that, once begun, a financial panic can spread rapidly and unpredictably; indeed, the failure of Lehman Brothers a\nday earlier, which the Fed and the Treasury unsuccessfully tried to prevent, resulted in the freezing up of a wide range of\ncredit markets, with extremely serious consequences for the world economy. The financial and economic risks posed by a\ncollapse of AIG would have been at least as great as those created by the demise of Lehman. In the case of AIG, financial\nmarket participants were keenly aware that many major financial institutions around the world were insured by or had lent\nfunds to the company. The company's failure would thus likely have led to a further sharp decline in confidence in the\nglobal banking system and possibly to the collapse of other major financial institutions. At best, the consequences of\nAIG's failure would have been a significant intensification of an already severe financial crisis and a further worsening of\neconomic conditions. Conceivably, its failure could have triggered a 1930s-style global financial and economic meltdown,\nwith catastrophic implications for production, incomes, and jobs.” (from “Four Questions about the Financial Crisis,”\navailable at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm)\n3\n\nIn remarks on April 14, 2009, Chairman Bernanke noted “that federal regulators urgently need a new set of\nprocedures for dealing with a complex, systemically important financial institution on the brink of failure. Such rules\nalready exists for banks: If a bank approaches insolvency, the FDIC is empowered to intervene as needed to protect\ndepositors, sell the bank's assets, and take any necessary steps to prevent broader consequences to the financial system.\nHowever, for an insurance conglomerate like AIG, or for a large financial holding company that owns many subsidiary\ncompanies, these rules do not apply. Among other things, a good system for resolving nonbank financial institutions\nwould allow federal regulators to unwind a failing company in ways that minimize disruptions in financial markets. An\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 6:45 AM, Tuesday, May 5, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time and 6:45 PM Tuesday, May 5, 2009 in Hong Kong – or Upon Delivery\n\neffective regime would also provide the authorities greater latitude to negotiate with creditors and to modify contracts\nentered into by the company, including contracts that set bonuses and other compensation for management.” (from “Four\nQuestions about the Financial Crisis,” available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm)\n4\n\n“Could a Systemic Regulator Have Seen the Current Crisis?”, available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2009/041509.htm\n5\n\nAs I have noted in earlier talks, unlike most prudential supervisors that focus on the solvency of individual\nfinancial institutions, a financial-stability regulator would clearly need to take more of a “macro” perspective on financial\ntrends (and their crosscurrents and unintended consequences). My assumption is that a financial-stability regulator would\nbe charged with making sure that what I will call “contagious” failures of financial institutions do not occur. Such failures\ncould involve a large group of financial intermediaries, all with a prominent shared risk exposure, or could involve one\nkey player becoming insolvent but many other financial institutions failing because of their exposure as counterparties to\nthat institution. This definition does not require that the involved organizations are depository institutions, nor does it\nhinge on the presence of deposit insurance. A key point is that the systemic regulator cannot just look institution by\ninstitution, but needs to think about the potentially difficult trends emerging across a swath of interconnected institutions\nand their counterparties. And while it may go without saying, for a systemic regulator to be effective, the regulator needs\nto be able to identify whether actual systemic problems are emerging. This involves, in part, assessing the “feedback\neffects” that might result from initial problems.\n6\n\nAs I noted in a recent speech, an effective systemic regulator would need to have very detailed understanding of\ninstitutional practices and products – simply put, how things really work, in good times and bad. For example, the\ncomplexities of the servicing business model and the reasons why it presents challenges in a declining market. Another\nexample is the market for credit default swaps, which ballooned but still seems less well understood than is desirable.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 1\nLegal Proceedings as a Result of\nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe 10th Seoul International Financial Forum\n\nSeoul, Korea\nApril 15, 2009\n\nI would like to thank the organizers of this important forum for inviting me to speak with you\ntoday.1 It is a great pleasure to return to Korea. On my last visit I had the opportunity to speak about\nthe information that central banks need to make informed decisions during periods of financial\nturmoil. My regret is that one year later this period of financial difficulty continues. Considering the\ndownstream economic hardships that so many people are encountering, these matters of regulatory\nframeworks and supervisory policies are both urgent and imperative.\nMost of the world is currently experiencing what has already been a long and severe recession.\nAs in several previous episodes, crises at leveraged financial institutions have been at the center of\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nproblems that eventually rippled across and profoundly impacted the global economy. So, realizing\nthe importance of a well-functioning financial sector to economic activity, many countries have taken\nextensive steps to stabilize financial systems, including providing additional capital in their banking\nsystem, guaranteeing debt, expanding deposit insurance, and guaranteeing (or limiting losses on)\nsome banking assets. These policy actions were taken to support the functioning of financial\ninstitutions and markets so that problems do not derail banks’ ability to continue lending to\ncreditworthy individuals and firms, hampering economic activity.\nThe need for such extensive government intervention on an essentially worldwide basis\nhighlights the importance of creating a more stable financial infrastructure – and, I believe, to have\norganizations with explicit responsibility for financial stability. As you know, policymakers in the\nU.S. and many other countries are right now working through the intricate and challenging issues\nassociated with the creation of a more effective regulatory structure. So I believe this forum is both\ntimely and important.\n\nDefining Financial Stability Supervision and Regulation\nIn my remarks today, I plan to explore a somewhat simple-sounding question that, when fully\nconsidered, has broad implications for the wider policy debate. The question is, could an effective\nsystemic regulator have spotted the roots of the current crisis, identifying the problems and\nanticipating their ramifications early enough for action to be taken?\nTo explore this question, I think we need to consider the issue of what data an effective\nregulator or supervisor with explicit financial-stability responsibilities might have been examining\nover the past 5 years – and what questions they might have been asking as they studied these data.\nKeep in mind that unlike most prudential supervisors that focus on the solvency of individual\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nfinancial institutions, a financial-stability regulator would clearly need to take more of a “macro”\nperspective on financial trends (and their crosscurrents and unintended consequences).\nFinancial stability is often cited but rarely defined, so for the purposes of this talk let us\nassume that a financial-stability regulator would be charged with making sure that what I will call\n“contagious” failures of financial institutions do not occur. Such failures could involve a large group\nof financial intermediaries, all with a prominent shared risk exposure, or could involve one key player\nbecoming insolvent but many other financial institutions failing because of their exposure as\ncounterparties to that institution. Please note that this definition does not require that the involved\norganizations are depository institutions, nor does it hinge on the presence of deposit insurance.\nOne – but not the only2 – important “warning flag” a systemic regulator would watch for\nwould be any significant divergence of financial trends from those of past experience. This would not\nnecessarily compel action by a systemic regulator, but should trigger more careful questioning. For\nexample: How are the financial trends being financed? Are financial institutions taken together –\nthus, the financial system – becoming more leveraged, or significantly increasing maturity\nmismatches? Are prudent underwriting standards still in use across the financial system, and by\npotentially-contagious institutions – or are prudent standards being abandoned? In short, do these\nnovel financial trends seem likely to hold up over time and be part of a healthy financial system, or\nnot? What are the risks to the financial system if an institution or a “trending” asset type becomes\nilliquid, or valueless?\nUpon exploring such questions, if a systemic regulator concludes that the financial trends that\ndiverge from past experience are indeed being generated by unsafe and unsound practices at highly\nleveraged institutions, and concludes that the practices could indeed result in highly correlated\nfinancial problems across the landscape of financial institutions, a fundamental issue would still\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nremain. The systemic regulator would need to have the powers necessary to stop the unsafe practices.\nThe issue of the powers needed to effectively mitigate such problems is very important and deserves\ncareful thought. I plan to make it a question for another talk, another day.\nA key point is that the systemic regulator cannot just look institution by institution, but needs\nto think about the potentially difficult trends emerging across a swath of interconnected institutions\nand their counterparties. And while it may go without saying, for a systemic regulator to be effective,\nthe regulator needs to be able to identify whether actual systemic problems are emerging. This\ninvolves, in part, assessing the “feedback effects” that might result from initial problems.\nSo I think it is instructive to ask whether a systemic regulator would have been able to identify\nthe problems that we are currently grappling with. So far today I have put what I think are key issues\nin front of you. Now I would like to flesh them out a bit through a brief discussion of some of the\nfinancial trends leading up to the current problems, and then consider whether these trends might have\ngenerated more actions if there had been a systemic regulator focused on these issues. I will conclude\nwith some thoughts on the international challenges to addressing systemic concerns.\n\nThe Development of Current Financial Problems: A Brief Review\nIn the United States, the initial trigger to the current financial crisis was deterioration in the\nhousing market. Because our time today is short, I will discuss mainly these housing-related trends –\nalthough it should be noted that questionable practices certainly extended beyond housing markets.3\nBetween 2004 and the early part of 2007, the housing market had experienced significant price\nappreciation, rapid expansion of construction of new houses and condominiums in some markets, and\na willingness by many investors to provide financing to higher-risk borrowers (using reduced\nunderwriting standards). The willingness to lend to borrowers who represented higher credit risks –\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\ngenerally by largely unregulated mortgage companies, not traditional banks – was fueled by the\nincreased ability to securitize subprime loans.\nThe securitization process took pools of subprime mortgages and split the income streams into\ntranches that would bear the first losses in the event of payment disruption, and tranches that would\nbear losses only after the lower tranches were wiped out. Because the odds were viewed as very\nsmall that losses would be so severe as to wipe out the lower tranches and affect the upper tranches,\nsellers of subprime mortgage-backed securities could market the tranches protected from most losses\nas Triple-A rated securities.\nThe result was that lenders that normally would not have been interested in riskier subprime\nmortgage loans in the United States, including many foreign investors, were willing to purchase such\nsecurities primarily based on their Triple A ratings, rather than by careful credit analysis involving the\ncharacteristics of the underlying collateral.4\nWhile the ability to finance mortgages with securitization helped fuel the housing boom in the\nUnited States, other countries that did not have substantial subprime lending also saw rapid increases\nin their real estate prices. As shown in Figure 1, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Spain all saw\nresidential house prices expand more rapidly than did the United States. However, there were\ncountries where residential real estate prices did not experience rapid appreciation – such as Japan and\nSouth Korea. Figure 2 shows that in some countries the growth in housing prices was much more\nrapid than the growth in incomes. One explanation for the rapid increase in some countries’ house\nprices is that during this period, nations that enjoyed significant trade surpluses or were the\nbeneficiaries of the commodity-price boom looked for investment opportunities; they gravitated to\ncountries where real assets were appreciating and where financial institutions or financial markets\nwere readily able to convert large pools of savings into investment opportunities.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nIn the United States, there existed significant demand for houses, including among low- and\nmoderate-income households that looked to participate in the housing boom. The securitization of\nsubprime mortgages provided a large pool of high-grade securities that paid higher returns than\nTreasury securities. These securities were attractive not only to U.S. investors but also to investors\naround the world looking for highly-rated securities.\nAs shown in Figure 3, beginning in 2003 subprime mortgages accounted for an increasing\nshare of new mortgages in the United States. As the supply of low- and moderate-income borrowers\nwith some capital and reasonable credit scores dwindled, there emerged an increased willingness to\nprovide loans to borrowers with little or no money down. With rating agencies not sufficiently\ndifferentiating their ratings to take into account worsening underwriting standards, and housing prices\nin some markets beginning to decline as the economy slowed, the default rates on many pools of\nmortgages began to increase. As the extent of the problems became apparent in the summer of 2007,\nfinancial markets became increasingly unwilling to hold securities backed by mortgages, became\nwary of the reliability of ratings, and began to question the size of the direct and indirect exposure of\nfinancial institutions.\n\nThe Role of a Systemic Regulator\nA starting point for an effective systemic regulator would be to carefully monitor any rapid\nappreciation of a particular asset class, and any rapid expansion of particular financial institutions or\nfinancial markets. While rapid growth in asset prices would not in and of itself necessitate any direct\nactions, it should cause a systemic regulator to ask several questions.\nFirst, can one develop a plausible fundamentals-based explanation of the rapid rise in prices?\nMany if not all past financial crises were associated with bubbles in asset prices, and in many cases\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\ncareful observers could eventually identify the appreciation as suspiciously detached from\nfundamentals. But there also will be cases in which the introduction of a new technology or the\nopening of new markets will justify a fairly rapid appreciation in an asset price that may not need to\nbe viewed as worrisome.\nSecond, is the rapid growth in an asset class financed by leveraged institutions? Losses at\nleveraged institutions tend to have a disproportionate negative impact because the deleveraging\nprocess (in shorthand, reigning in assets like loans to maintain a reasonable capital-to-assets ratio at\nthe institution) has a broad impact on the borrowers who depend on the financial intermediary for\nloans. In addition, most leveraged financial institutions have extensive counterparty exposures to\nother financial institutions, raising the risk that counterparties will call for additional collateral from\ninterconnected institutions they see faltering, which can exacerbate problems with capitalization.\nThird, has the rapid expansion of the financing caused any financial institutions to increase\ntheir leverage? Increases in leverage make a financial intermediary more at risk should losses be\nincurred.\nFourth, has there been a significant change in the mismatch involved in funding long-term\nassets with short-term liabilities? While the transformation of funding is an integral role for many\nfinancial intermediaries, significant changes in asset-liability maturity structure can make the financial\nintermediary susceptible to liquidity problems, particularly if falling asset prices reduce confidence in\nthe financial intermediary.\nIn the most recent experience, all of these questions would need to be answered in the\naffirmative. As I mentioned earlier, real estate prices rose rapidly. A more subtle dynamic involved\nhow leveraged financial institutions financed the growth. Many large commercial banks held TripleA rated securities, or held these securities in off-balance sheet conduits. While it was well understood\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nthat these financial institutions were involved in the originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending\nand securitization, what was less understood was the nature and extent of the holdings within the\nTriple-A securities.\nBecause of their perceived low credit risk, Triple-A rated securities received relatively little\nattention by bank examiners, particularly as real estate prices were appreciating. In addition, I think it\nis important to note that three of the largest exposures were held by a commercial bank, an investment\nbank, and a foreign bank, which likely made the potential problem less obvious to any single\nregulator.\nThe increase in leverage was most obvious for the investment banks, which had become very\nlarge players in securitizing assets. In part, the securitization was financed by holding large pools of\nmortgage assets and financing them through short-term repurchase agreements. The result was that\ninvestment banks had not only increased their leverage significantly (see Figure 4) but they had also\nincreased the mismatch of the terms of their assets and liabilities. This made the investment banks\nthat were actively originating and distributing mortgages at greater risk should investors become less\nconfident in their organizations.\nBecause no one was charged with systemic regulation, the problematic links among an array\nof key factors were largely missed, until the problems had become quite severe. Those factors\nincluded rising real estate prices, changes in underwriting standards by largely unregulated mortgage\nbrokers, the rapid rise in securitization outside of supervisors’ purview, the dependence on credit\nratings that are largely unregulated, the increased holdings of highly rated securities both off and on\nbalance sheets, and the change in leverage and asset-liability composition of investment banks. A\nsystemic regulator charged with taking an “aerial view” – understanding changes in markets and how\nthey impact leveraged institutions – would likely have intervened earlier, if operating effectively.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nThis brings up a related point. Recent events suggest that an effective systemic regulator must\nhave very detailed understanding of institutional practices and products – simply put, how things\nreally work, in good times and bad. For example, securitization grew rapidly, and while many\nobservers did take note, it took much longer to come to understand the complexities of the servicing\nbusiness model and the reasons why it presents challenges in a declining market. Another example is\nthe market for credit default swaps, which ballooned but still seems less well understood than is\ndesirable.\nIn sum, you might say that a systemic regulator must connect potential dots – not just actual\ndots. Assuming the systemic regulator has the ability to monitor solvency risk, liquidity risk, and risk\nmanagement practices, and react to practices viewed as unsafe or unsound, some of the most serious\nfinancial problems might have been identified, and their severity lessened.\n\nInternational Coordination\nFinancial problems at leveraged institutions increasingly require international coordination.\nWhile the subprime market was largely a U.S. phenomenon, the run-up in real estate prices was not\nunique to the United States. Other countries experienced rapid appreciation in real estate, though the\nfinancing vehicles were different.\nIn the United States both domestic and foreign financial institutions were involved. In\naddition, many of the American institutions had a significant global footprint. Thus, the\naforementioned deleveraging process impacts any country where the leveraged institutions are active.\nThe financial assets were also being sold worldwide. The result was that losses were correlated\nwithout much regard to national borders, and exposures to the subprime market appeared in a\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\nsurprising variety of financial intermediaries. Thus, the actions of intermediaries in one country can\nhave a significant spillover to other countries’ financial systems.\nAs financial intermediaries become more global, resolution becomes more difficult. The\nresolution of a large global player is quite different than resolution of a purely domestic institution. A\nglobally active institution placed into receivership in the home country may quickly find that its\nability to transfer deposits, cash, and capital is hampered as host countries impose controls to protect\nliability holders in their own country. So, until global resolution policies are adopted, resolution of\ninternationally active organizations will remain problematic.\nBeyond this issue of the resolution of individual organizations, it seems clear that effective\nsystemic regulators will need to understand how the actions of financial intermediaries in one country\naffect other countries’ financial systems. This will be both extremely important and, potentially, very\nchallenging.\n\nSummary Observations\nMost countries, including the United States, do not currently have a systemic regulator. In\norder for a systemic regulator to be effective, the regulator clearly needs to be able to identify\nproblematic situations like those I have described today. Had there been some entity charged with\nsuch responsibilities, my hope is that sufficient “red flags” would have emerged to give such an entity\nthe opportunity to prevent, or at least mitigate, some of the problems. At the same time, my remarks\ntoday should also convey the profound challenges that a systemic regulator would face. Of course,\nthe next time a crisis begins, the patterns may be very different.\nAnd while the ability to identify emerging systemic problems is critical, it is not enough. To\nhave an effective systemic regulator, obviously having sufficient authority to change behavior is also\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:30 PM on Tuesday, April 14, 2009 U.S. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery, and\n10:30 AM on Wednesday, April 15, 2009 in Seoul, Korea\n\ncritically important. The issue of authority is, however, too large a topic to be covered today. I know\nthat I, and many of you, will be exploring that topic in the days and weeks ahead.\nI want to conclude by reiterating my strong hope that the recent crisis will provide not only the\nopportunity but also the urgency and will for a thorough, global reexamination of how we think about\nsystemic problems and their mitigation and resolution. And of course, as our nations consider the role\nof a systemic regulator it will be important that they have the ability to interact in a coordinated way\nwith their regulatory counterparts around the world.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nOther warning flags might include the emergence of exceptionally complicated or otherwise opaque\nfinancial instruments with contractual terms that are not widely understood.\n\n3\n\nFor example, participation in auction-rate markets represented a good-faith effort by municipalities to\nachieve lower interest rates on their borrowings, but in essence financed longer-term assets with short-term\nliabilities.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nField hearing of the\nCommittee on Financial Services of the\nU.S. House of Representatives:\n“Seeking Solutions –\nFinding Credit for Small and\nMid-Size Businesses in Massachusetts”\n\nMonday, March 23, 2009\nMassachusetts State House\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\n\fNote: The figures (charts) mentioned in this testimony are attached below the text.\n\nChairman Frank and members of the Committee, it is my pleasure to appear before you\ntoday to discuss the availability of credit for businesses amid the current economic and financial\nturmoil, and the steps the Federal Reserve is taking to help make credit available to small and\nmedium-sized businesses.\nIn my testimony today I plan to first share some national context, and some perspective\non the Federal Reserve System’s responses to date. I plan to then comment, more briefly, on the\nsituation in Massachusetts.\n\nThe National Context\nSince August of 2007, financial markets have been severely disrupted. The functioning\nof financial markets and the functioning of institutions that serve as financial intermediaries have\ntremendous downstream impacts on businesses, state and local governments, and households.\nAs a result, these disruptions are of great concern to the Federal Reserve as we pursue our policy\ngoals of maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\nWhile credit availability has been a concern since the outset of the financial crisis, the\ncredit situation became more severe as problems expanded beyond a few large financial\ninstitutions focused on subprime-mortgage securitizations to a broader group of financial\ninstitutions. The Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending\n1\n\n\fPractices has been showing substantial tightening of credit, which dovetails with the\nperspectives voiced since last summer by many advisory groups we engage at the Boston Fed.\nOther entities such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts are finding when they survey\ncompanies that credit conditions are tightening – and that the tightening may affect companies\ndirectly, or indirectly through suppliers and customers who face credit constraints.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains focused on ensuring adequate\nfinancing for businesses of all sizes. Last week’s official FOMC statement indicated, among\nother things, that “weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses\nto cut back on inventories and fixed investment.” Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve’s\nBeige Book report suggested that “The availability of credit generally remained tight. Lenders\ncontinued to impose strict standards for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further\ntightening and particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate\ntransactions.”\nCredit availability issues remain a significant focus at the Federal Reserve and are a\nsignificant factor in how we are addressing the current economic and financial problems. The\nFederal Reserve has acted proactively and creatively to address these concerns – first by\naggressively easing conventional monetary policy (the federal funds rate) and, since the fall,\nusing less-conventional monetary policy tools to mitigate continuing problems with the cost and\navailability of financing for businesses and households.\nFigure 1 shows how the Federal Reserve acted to address problems in financial markets,\nand concerns that market disruptions would impact the cost and availability of finance, by\nrapidly moving the target federal funds rate to only a little above zero. As the Federal Reserve\n\n2\n\n\flowered the target federal funds rate, most short-term market interest rates fell – although not\ncommensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate.\nIt is important to note that many small and medium-sized businesses have loans tied to\nthe prime rate, or to the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor, which decreased significantly\nas we moved the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in July 2007 to between zero and onequarter of one percent at the end of December. While a year ago many observers were critical of\nthese rapid rate cuts, it is fortunate that the Federal Reserve did move so quickly. While the\nreduction in interest rates did not prevent the economy’s weakening, it helped cushion the\neconomy against some of the shocks experienced over the past year.\nWith the federal funds rate approaching the zero bound, the Federal Reserve has turned to\nsome alternative approaches to monetary policy, which have rapidly increased the Fed’s balance\nsheet. Many of the new programs are intended to improve the availability of credit in the\nmarketplace and reduce the cost, which had not fallen commensurate with the decline in the\nfederal funds rate. I would like to briefly discuss these Federal Reserve programs.\nFigure 2 shows the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. The largest expansion of the\nbalance sheet occurred in the fall, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly\nfragile state of financial markets. Our actions were designed to improve the functioning of\ninterbank lending. Borrowers and businesses whose rates are tied to interbank rates like Libor\nbenefit as interbank lending markets see more normal spreads and declining rates.\nAllow me to mention two programs that have been critical to the improvements in\ninterbank lending markets and the related reduction in market interest rates – the Federal\nReserve’s Term Auction Facility or TAF, and a network of liquidity swap lines we have arranged\n3\n\n\fwith other central banks. The TAF is designed to help ensure that banks can obtain the funds\nthey need to provide credit to their customers. It involves an auction-model variant of discountwindow lending to financial institutions (backed by collateral subject to significant “haircuts,” to\nmitigate risk to the Federal Reserve). Central bank liquidity swaps are loans made to foreign\ncentral banks so that they can provide dollar funding to their banks in much the same manner as\nour TAF.\nThese two programs were designed to stabilize and improve the functioning of the\ninterbank dollar-lending market – indeed, to ease conditions in global dollar markets that were\nspilling over into our own funding markets. As shown in Figure 3, the Libor rate is now much\nmore aligned with the federal funds rate. The reduction in the Libor rate helps a variety of\nborrowers. Most subprime mortgages have reset rates tied to Libor, many credit card rates are\ntied to Libor, and the rates on many business loans are tied to Libor. The actions we have taken\nare reducing the cost of financing for borrowers and businesses whose rates are tied to Libor and\nthus influenced by the functioning of interbank dollar lending markets.\nI would like to mention another area of substantial growth in the Fed’s balance sheet –\nspecifically, the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities designed to provide market support and\nimprove conditions in short-term credit markets (see Figure 4). Some, like the Commercial\nPaper Funding Facility (CPFF), provide an alternative funding source to the market when interest\nrate spreads become very elevated.\nIn general, the various programs that have expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet\nshould be less attractive to market participants as financial conditions improve. Figure 5 shows\n\n4\n\n\fthat of late, the rate on asset-backed commercial paper has fallen dramatically, and many issuers\ncan receive better terms by issuing commercial paper directly to the market.\nFigure 6 shows that the prime money market funds have tended of late to have a net\ninflow of funds, which has helped stabilize short-term credit markets because money market\nfunds are a key investor in these markets. Correspondingly, money market funds have reduced\ntheir reliance on the Fed liquidity facility that was designed to help them – the asset-backed\ncommercial paper money-market mutual fund liquidity facility, or AMLF. This experience\nprovides a clear example of how improved market conditions provide incentives for financial\nfirms to reduce reliance on our facilities. We expect this to be the case for many of our facilities\nas the economy and financial markets gradually improve. Stabilized short-term credit markets\nmean that businesses that borrow with commercial paper are able to obtain less costly, more\ndependable sources of financing. In addition, many issuers of commercial paper used the\nfunding to provide loans to businesses to finance receivables, to provide floor plan financing, and\nto provide other types of essential short-term credit.\nTwo new programs should provide additional help to markets. First, the Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is designed to facilitate the renewed issuance of\nconsumer and small business asset-backed securities – essentially providing a financing vehicle\nfor credit instruments that have been disrupted by poor functioning in securitization markets.\nThis facility, which is just starting up, should help make credit more available for student loans,\nconsumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans; leading to lower borrowing\nrates and improved access in the market for consumer and small business credit. The facility\nwill do this by lending against triple-A rated asset-backed securities collateralized by recently\noriginated student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small\n5\n\n\fBusiness Administration, mortgage servicing advances, loans or leases relating to business\nequipment, leases of vehicle fleets, or floorplan loans. A second program involves the largescale purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities. As shown in Figure 7, conventional\nmortgage rates that had been around 6 percent have declined since the announcement of this\nprogram.\nLast Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee announced that to provide greater\nsupport to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Federal Reserve would further increase its\nbalance sheet by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities (bringing its total purchases of these securities up to $1.25 trillion this year), and to\nincrease its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion (to a total of up to $200\nbillion). An important effect of this program is that it provides lower cost loans to homeowners,\nbut it should be recognized that the program also bears significant benefits for many small\nbusinesses, which often rely on home equity loans as a critical source of initial financing. I\nshould also mention that in order to improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee\non Wednesday decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the\nnext six months. This action is expected to ease credit conditions in a wide variety of markets\nthat tie their cost of finance to Treasury yields.\n\nThe Situation in Massachusetts\nWhile my goal today has been to provide some national context and perspective, I would\nlike to add a few comments about the situation in Massachusetts and New England. Figure 8\nshows that lending patterns in the United States differ depending on the financial condition of the\n6\n\n\fbanks. Banks with the lowest supervisory ratings have reduced their lending while banks in\nbetter health show positive asset-growth percentages. Empirical research suggests that during\nprevious banking crises this behavior was, to an important degree, explained by differences in\nthe ability to supply credit, not just differences in the demand for credit. As you know, extending\ncredit means expanding the asset side of the balance sheet for a bank, and banks must maintain a\nreasonable capital-to-assets ratio. This underlines the importance of steps to bolster or resolve\npoorly capitalized banks, in order to address broader problems of credit availability.\nFigure 9 shows that the share of commercial and savings banks with the lowest\nsupervisory ratings is quite a bit smaller in New England than it is nationally – and furthermore,\nthat share has remained constant in New England while doubling for the nation overall in a\nyear’s time. Considering the aforementioned dynamic, the good news locally is that a greater\nshare of New England banks are in good health and thus more able to supply credit to businesses.\nOf course, most anecdotal indications are that even among healthy banks willing to lend to\ncreditworthy borrowers, standards have probably tightened in response to the riskier environment\n(that is, over concern related to the impact of the slowing economy on even creditworthy\nborrowers).\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would offer just a few summary thoughts. Over the last year and a half\nor so, the Federal Reserve has been proactive and innovative in trying to address problems in\nfinancial markets and the broader economy. While traditional monetary policy had focused on\nlowering the federal funds rate to spur interest-sensitive economic activity, now that this rate has\n7\n\n\fapproached the zero-bound floor, the Federal Reserve has focused on more direct means of\nlowering the cost of credit in the marketplace, which had not fallen commensurate with the\ndecline in the federal funds rate. Federal Reserve programs have intended to offset disruptions to\ninterbank lending, short-term credit financing, the ability of money market mutual funds to meet\ninvestor redemption requests, and housing finance – and these program should have beneficial\neffects on the cost and availability of credit for businesses.\nThank you for inviting me to testify today. If I can answer any questions I would be very\npleased to do so.\n\n8\n\n\fFigures\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 1\nFederal Funds Effective Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n\nPercent\n6\n5\n4\nFederal Funds Effective Rate\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2-Jan-07\n\n17-Apr-07\n\n31-Jul-07\n\n13-Nov-07\n\n26-Feb-08\n\n10-Jun-08\n\n23-Sep-08\n\n6-Jan-09\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n1\n\nFigure 2\nComposition of Federal Reserve System Assets\nJune 27, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n\nBillions of Dollars\n2 500\n2,500\n\nInstitution Specific\nGSE/MBS\n\n2,000\n\nMarket Support\nCentral Bank Liquidity Swaps\n\n1,500\n\nDiscount Window\nTreasury Securities and Other Assets\n\n1,000\n500\n0\n27-Jun-07 26-Sep-07 26-Dec-07 26-Mar-08\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n\n25-Jun-08 24-Sep-08 31-Dec-08 18-Mar-09\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 3\nOne-Month London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) and the Federal Funds Target Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n\nPercent\n6\n5\nOne-Month LIBOR\n4\n3\n2\nFederal Funds Target\n1\n0\n2-Jan-07\n\n17-Apr-07\n\n31-Jul-07\n\n13-Nov-07\n\n26-Feb-08\n\n10-Jun-08\n\n23-Sep-08\n\n6-Jan-09\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times / Haver Analytics\n\n3\n\nFigure 4\nFederal Reserve System Assets\nheld by Market Support Facilities\nSeptember 24, 2008 - March 18, 2009\n\nBillions of Dollars\n400\n\nAMLF\n\nCP Funding Facility\n\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n24-Sep-08 15-Oct-08\n\n5-Nov-08 26-Nov-08 17-Dec-08\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n\n7-Jan-09\n\n28-Jan-09 18-Feb-09 11-Mar-09\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 5\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - March 18, 2009\n\nPercent\n8\n1-Day AA Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n2-Jan-07\n\n17-Apr-07\n\n31-Jul-07\n\n13-Nov-07\n\n26-Feb-08\n\n10-Jun-08\n\n23-Sep-08\n\n6-Jan-09\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n5\n\nFigure 6\nDaily Change in Money Market Fund Assets\nin Prime Funds\nAugust 1, 2008 - March 18, 2009\n\nBillions of Dollars\n30\n\nAMLF program commences.\n\n0\nLehman\nfails.\n\n-30\n\nTreasury announces\ninsurance for MMMFs.\n\nThe Reserve Primary\nFund breaks the buck.\n\n-60\n\nFed announces\nAMLF program.\n\n-90\n-120\n-150\n1-Aug\n\n25-Aug\n\n17-Sep\n\n9-Oct\n\n3-Nov\n\n26-Nov\n\n19-Dec\n\n14-Jan\n\n6-Feb\n\n3-Mar\n\nNote: Prime funds include both retail and institutional funds.\nSource: iMoneyNet\n\n6\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 7\nNational Average Mortgage Rates\nSeptember 2, 2008 - March 18, 2009\n\nPercent\n8\n\n7\n30-Year Fixed-Rate Jumbo\n\n6\nNovember 25 -- Federal Reserve announces purchase\nprogram for GSE direct obligations and MBS.\n\n5\n30-Year Fixed-Rate Conventional\n\n4\n2-Sep-08\n\n30-Sep-08\n\n28-Oct-08\n\n25-Nov-08\n\n23-Dec-08\n\n20-Jan-09\n\n17-Feb-09\n\n17-Mar-09\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n7\n\nFigure 8\nAsset Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks\nby CAMELS Rating*\nDecember 31, 2007 - December 31, 2008\n\nPercent Change, December 31, 2007 - December 31, 2008\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n\nCAMELS Rating of 1 or 2\n\n-15\n\nCAMELS Rating of 3, 4, or 5\n\n-20\nTotal Assets\n\nTotal Loans\n\nCommercial and\nIndustrial Loans\n\nCommercial Real Estate\nLoans\n\n*The CAMELS rating is a highly confidential supervisory rating which assesses six components of a bank's condition: capital\nadequacy (C), asset quality (A), management (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity to market risk (S).

Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nAddressing the Credit Crisis\nand Restructuring the\nFinancial Regulatory System:\nLessons from Japan\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nInstitute of International Bankers\nAnnual Washington Conference\n\nWashington, DC\nMarch 2, 2009\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you today. Allow me to begin with an observation: It is\n\nrarely good when bankers, and central bankers, are considered especially “newsworthy.” But the\nfinancial and economic turmoil of the past year and a half has banking and financial markets at\nthe epicenter of current problems, and very much in the spotlight.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nTwo years ago, few saw the extent of the problems to come. Bank stock prices were at\nrecord highs, earnings forecasts were rosy, and bank capital seemed sufficient. Indeed, a striking\naspect of this episode is the fact that many banks went into the current banking problems with\nunusually high capital ratios. As Figure 1 shows, aggregate U.S. bank capital had grown\nsignificantly over the past two decades, as preparations for the Basel II Capital Accord and\nadvances in banks’ own internal modeling led banks, generally speaking, to become better\ncapitalized.\nHowever, in less than two years the banking environment has changed dramatically.\nLosses have mounted and a number of small and large banks here and abroad have required\nextensive government support, or were forced to close. Furthermore, banking problems are\nhaving macroeconomic consequences, as obtaining financing from banks and securities markets\nhas become a more uncertain proposition for companies and individuals.\nToday I want to discuss some lessons I have drawn from the Japanese experience in the\n1990s, a topic I explored in depth with fellow researchers. Allow me to share at the outset two\noverarching questions that I think we must keep in mind. First, how can we reduce the\nmacroeconomic consequences of procyclical regulatory and accounting policies? (By\n“procyclical” policies I mean those that magnify economic fluctuations). And second, how can\nwe more quickly remove problem assets to get banks and financial markets focused on future\npossibilities, rather than past problems? Certainly my remarks today will not resolve these\nimportant questions, but they must remain in our sights.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nLessons from Japan’s Experience\nIn the early 1990s, the prices of Japanese real estate and stocks experienced sharp\ndeclines. As is usually the case, losses in collateral values had a disproportionate impact on\nbanks. But unlike their counterparts in the United States, many Japanese banks had extensive\nstock holdings, which compounded their problems as falling share prices coincided with loan\nlosses and resulted in a significant shortage of bank capital.\nBut as bad as the initial problems were, the failure to quickly restore banks’ financial\nhealth had serious consequences for the Japanese economy, which as you know experienced\ngrowth below potential for over a decade. There are several lessons – admittedly intertwined –\nthat I take from my studies of this experience:\n•\n\nFirst, undercapitalized banks behave differently than well-capitalized banks.\n\n•\n\nSecond, certain bank-regulatory and accounting policies may amplify the business\ncycle.\n\n•\n\nThird, troubled assets need to be moved off bank balance sheets as quickly as\npossible.\n\nAllow me to discuss each of these lessons in just a bit of detail.\n\nFirst, empirical research suggests that undercapitalized banks behave differently than\nwell-capitalized banks. Undercapitalized banks shift their attention to short-run capital\npreservation rather than long-run profit maximization, and this change in goals has several\nundesirable effects. Perhaps the most undesirable is that undercapitalized banks, finding it\ndifficult to raise additional capital, are forced to improve their capital ratios by shrinking assets1.\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nBanks hold capital in part to absorb loan losses that are in excess of loan-loss reserves,\nand seek to maintain a reasonable ratio of capital to assets. A reduction in the value of capital\nleads a bank to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet, to maintain the desired capital-to-assets\nratio. Thus, since loans are usually the bank’s most significant asset, lending becomes more\nrestrictive.\nReturning to the case of Japanese banks in the 1990s, they tended to shrink their assets\nabroad, in some cases pulling out of markets where their prospects were arguably better than\ntheir prospects from additional domestic loans2. And, because undercapitalized banks seek to\nshrink without incurring additional losses, the specific form the asset shrinkage took could be\nperverse. For instance, some banks would support troubled borrowers in an effort to avoid loss\nrecognition, while reducing credit to more creditworthy borrowers with whom the bank could\ncurtail credit without incurring a loss3. In short, as the banks sought to preserve or shore up\ncapital-to-assets ratios, they disposed of assets (indeed, the particularly salable ones) or declined\nto add new ones.\nAdditionally, undercapitalized banks have an incentive to postpone reserving for problem\nloans, to avoid further depleting capital. This is why loan loss provisioning often rises\nsignificantly as a result of an exam of an undercapitalized bank4.\nFigure 2 shows that lending patterns in the United States differ depending on the\nfinancial condition of the banks. Banks with the lowest supervisory ratings have reduced their\nlending significantly more than have banks in better health. Empirical research suggests that\nduring previous banking crises this behavior was, to an important degree, explained by\ndifferences in the ability to supply credit not just differences in the demand for credit5. Thus the\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nevidence from Japan and previous problems in the U.S. indicates that allowing poorly capitalized\nbanks to continue operations with insufficient capital is likely to exacerbate problems with credit\navailability.\nMy second observation from Japan’s experience, and the current banking problems in the\nU.S., is that certain bank-regulatory and accounting policies may amplify the business cycle – in\nother words, they are procyclical. During a downturn, assets that are pledged as collateral\nagainst bank loans decline in value. Of course, collateral value is only one procyclical driver6.\nNonetheless, declining collateral values generally result in higher loss rates on non-performing\nloans. In terms of accounting, higher loss rates result in larger loan charge-offs and increases in\nloan loss reserves – which depletes capital and leads banks to reduce lending (the asset side of\ntheir balance sheet) in order to maintain capital-to-assets ratios.\nOne step that might make banking problems less procyclical would be to thoughtfully\nexamine, and consider modifying, policies related to loan-loss reserves – specifically, how loan\nloss reserves are calculated for purposes of determining regulatory capital and for financial\nstatements.\nUnder current policies, regulatory rules essentially follow U.S. generally-accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) in determining an appropriate loan-loss reserve. U.S. GAAP\naccounting rules provide that a loan-loss reserve should reflect probable and estimable losses that\nhave already been incurred in the loan portfolio, but have not yet been discovered. This is often\nreferred to as the “incurred loss” model. The accounting profession often notes that these\naccounting rules were written in this way, in part, to inject more transparency into the reserve\nsetting process and to address concerns about financial manipulation.\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nA criticism of the accountant’s view is that as financial conditions deteriorate, loan loss\nreserves lag the increases in nonperforming loans and expected losses (see Figure 3). It can be\nargued that this is true because management failed to adequately assess changes in current loss\nestimates, or because reserve models are somewhat backward looking. In either case, it has been\nobserved in previous periods of banking problems that loan-loss reserves were low at the\nbeginning of the banking problems, lagged as problems became apparent, and likely to peak at\nthe very time that we could most use bank capital to be at work financing economic recovery.\nSolutions to this predicament, which I will not expound on or argue for today, would do well to\nresult in earlier loss recognition, more rapidly addressed problems, and indeed a curtailing of\nhigh-risk lending earlier in the cycle.\nAgain, my goal today is to point out some lessons we would all do well to consider and\napply. Proposals to make reserving less procyclical will no doubt take different forms. To an\neconomist’s way of thinking, a reserve should not be limited to a view of a current period or\nsnapshot in time, focusing on losses that are currently in the portfolio based on loans made\npreviously – rather, expected future losses should also be considered. For example, if one\nanticipates that unemployment rates were to rise rapidly, a statistical calculation of expected\nlosses looking through the cycle may be very different than the losses that are probable and\nestimable given current economic conditions7. This more comprehensive view of loan losses\ncould lend itself to addressing some of the perceived shortfalls associated with the current\naccounting model.\nSome of you, I am sure, are familiar with a variant from Spain which bears study;\nwhereby “stress” losses are estimated and loan-loss reserves are built up during good times. The\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\npromising aspect is that losses draw down the reserve rather than capital, so capital is much less\nsensitive to current economic conditions and thus there is less pressure to reduce lending during\nperiods of financial difficulty.\nI think there is a compelling argument for some form of action to address procyclicality\nthrough policy change. Whether that policy change should be addressed through accounting or\nregulatory rules is open to debate. Of course, any changes proposed for accounting rules must\ntake pains to avoid inviting so-called “earnings management,” and should respect the needs of\ninvestors and other primary users of financial statements. In whatever form policy ultimately\ntakes, both current losses in the portfolio as well as the “stress” losses would need to be\ndisclosed, in a transparent and rules-based manner.\nThe third lesson I take from the Japanese experience is that troubled assets should be\nmoved off bank balance sheets as quickly as possible. Banks with troubled assets focus on\navoiding further losses and further depleting capital. Troubled banks in Japan were often more\nsupportive of problem borrowers than borrowers who had good prospects going forward.\nFocusing on future growth requires removing the problem assets.\nFurthermore, governments are not the best managers of bad assets. Removing bad assets\nand quickly selling to new owners are steps that are likely to get resources allocated to their best\neconomic use. When a bank is closed with FDIC support, this is relatively straightforward. The\nbad assets are removed from the bank and quickly disposed of by the FDIC, and the good assets\nare sold to an acquirer. The new acquirer does not spend time focused on the problems of the\npast, but rather, focuses on maximizing future profitability. This is a reason for moving to\nresolve, as quickly as possible, banks that are clearly insolvent.\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nThe problem becomes more difficult when the bad assets are in troubled, but not\ninsolvent, banks. In this case, bank management becomes focused on the problem assets, and\nways to avoid realizing losses that would threaten the solvency of the bank. The problem is\nparticularly complicated during the current period, because of the intertwining of liquidity and\ncredit problems in securities portfolios.\nA good example of the potential liquidity problems is provided by securities backed by\nstudent loans that are 97 percent guaranteed by the government (see Figure 4). Currently there\nexist about $250 billion in these securities, many of which are held by banks or bank-affiliated\nconduits. Despite the 97 percent guarantee, pricing services suggest prices below, and in some\ncases significantly below, 97 percent of face value. This discount suggests that sales of such\nassets are taking place by sellers who have no option but to sell – and suggests that given the\nfinancing and balance sheet constraints of most buyers, they will only purchase the asset for a\nprice well below the level one would expect considering the government guarantee. Given the\ngovernment guarantee, most of the discount in these securities seems to be the result of liquidity\nconcerns.\nFor securities where the problem appears to be liquidity rather than credit concerns, there\nshould be a role for purchasing these assets and reducing the liquidity premium. Consider the\naforementioned securities backed by student loans, where liquidity concerns seem to be driving\nthe steep discounts. If the securities were purchased at a more modest haircut relative to the\ngovernment guarantee – say for 94 percent of face value – it would serve to significantly reduce\nthe liquidity premium, allowing banks to use much higher marks in their investment portfolios,\nand thus improve their capital position while still purchasing the assets at a price below the\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\ngovernment guarantee. These, of course, are benefits they would realize if they could hold the\nsecurity to maturity. With their capital position enhanced, the banks could do more to restore\ncredit flows.\nA more difficult issue relates to loans and securities that would be deeply discounted\nprimarily because of credit concerns. For banks, selling such assets below their net recorded\nvalue, thus recognizing a loss, involves further depletion of capital. Incenting banks to remove\nthese problem assets is likely to require more supervisory pressure to appropriately reserve\nagainst or write down those assets, and to take actions to quickly dispose of the assets.\nGranted, this is not an unusual role for supervisors – frequently, written agreements and\ncease-and-desist orders require increasing reserves, improving risk and credit management, and\nexpediting the removal of bad assets. In this case, moving more quickly to mandate reserving for\nand disposing of problem assets will speed recovery from current problems.\n\nConclusion\nIn sum, the Japanese experience of the 1990s highlights the fact that forbearance can\nhave significant macroeconomic consequences. Troubled banks are reluctant to expand balance\nsheets or to address problems with troubled assets. I believe it would be desirable to move\nquickly to remove problem assets from bank balance sheets, so banks can once again focus on\nfuture prospects rather than past mistakes.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Monday, March 2, 2009\nat 11:30 A.M.

However, we should use the attention and urgency of this moment to\ngalvanize the hard thinking and hard work needed to remedy the current crisis, and put in place a\nframework that will help us avoid future crises, going forward.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"The International Transmission of Financial Shocks: The Case of\nJapan,\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.\n\n2\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real\nActivity in the United States,\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 3045.\n\n3\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of\nCredit in Japan,\" the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166.\n\n4\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “Bank regulation and the credit crunch,” in the Journal of Banking\n& Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.\n5\n\nSee the article I wrote with Joe Peek, “Bank regulation and the credit crunch,” in the Journal of Banking\n& Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692.\n6\n\nJoined by things like the increased likelihood, in a downturn, that the borrower will have difficulty\nrepaying; a likely decline in the value of a bank’s investment portfolio; and additional challenges in\nraising capital.\n\n7\n\nCurrent accounting conventions do not capture expected losses in the portfolio considering all available\ninformation – which would be the concept used by a statistician, a risk manager, or an economist to\ncalculate expected losses.\n10\n\n\fFigure 1\nEquity Capital to Assets Ratio at\nCommercial and Savings Banks\n1989:Q1 – 2008:Q3\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n\fFigure 2\nAsset Growth at Commercial and Savings Banks\nby CAMELS Rating\nSeptember 30, 2007 – September 30, 2008\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports and author’s calculations.\nNote: Analysis uses CAMELS ratings as of September 30, 2008.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nThe University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nand Brandeis International Business School\n\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 27, 2009\n\nI am pleased to participate in this important forum again this year, and welcome the\nopportunity to discuss monetary policy during the current financial crisis. Thank you for inviting\nme to be here with all of you and with Charles Plosser and Rick Mishkin.\nAs you know, what began as a problem involving securitized subprime mortgages in the\nUnited States has become a problem of global reach and historic proportions. The problem grew\nin scope and severity as investors became skeptical of financial statements, and as the ability to\nvalue and trade a wide variety of financial instruments became severely impaired.\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nProblems in financial markets spilled over into the real economy and contributed to\ndeteriorating economic conditions. The U.S. economy lost 1.8 million jobs over the past three\nmonths. With the economy likely to shrink significantly in the first half of this year, the\nunemployment rate rising higher than 8.5 percent is, unfortunately, very likely.1\nUnlike in some previous periods of financial disruption, this time around most countries\nare well aware of the precarious financial circumstances and have taken action to mitigate the\nproblems. While the responses have varied, in most countries the monetary authorities have\neased interest rates, the regulatory authorities have taken actions to shore up financial\nintermediaries, and the fiscal authorities have adopted more expansionary or “stimulative”\npolicies than previously were planned.\nIn combination, these actions – along with lower energy prices – will, I hope, provide a\nfoundation for positive economic growth in many countries in the latter half of this year.\nHowever, I believe that below-potential growth is likely to persist until financial markets and\nfinancial institutions can resume more normal functioning. So in addition to the other steps\nbeing taken to stimulate the economy, we need to be sure that actions to support the stability of\nthe financial system are taken without delay – and, in the slightly longer term, that regulatory\nframeworks are thoughtfully reformed.\n\nMonetary Policy During the Crisis\nFigure 1 highlights a striking feature of this financial crisis – the rather rapid movement,\nat least by central banking standards, to a federal funds rate only a little above zero. The Federal\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nReserve has moved with commendable speed in lowering the interest rate target to address\nproblems in financial markets and the real economy.\nOf course, one year ago many observers were critical of the Federal Reserve’s rapid\ninterest rate cuts. Total inflation was above the “comfort zone” of many, as rapid increases in oil\nand commodity prices were occurring despite unsettled financial markets. In retrospect, it is\nfortunate that the Federal Reserve moved as quickly as it did. While the rapid reduction in\ninterest rates did not prevent a recession, it has mitigated the depth of the downturn and\ncushioned the economy against some of the shocks experienced over the past year.\nHowever – with the federal funds rate bounded by zero, the forecast one of continued\nweakness, and challenges in the transmission of funds-rate changes into borrowing rates in the\nmarketplace – the Federal Reserve has turned to some alternative approaches to monetary policy.\nI would like to take a moment to highlight some key steps we have taken in this regard, and some\nof their implications.\nFirst, the Federal Reserve has taken pains to make clear in communications that it will\ntake all necessary actions to stabilize the economy. At the same time the FOMC has increased\ntransparency by providing longer-range forecasts of growth, inflation, and unemployment –\ngiven the current structure of the economy, the presence of appropriate monetary policy, and an\nabsence of unexpected shocks.2 Chairman Bernanke addressed this topic in his speech at the\nNational Press Club last week.3\nThe added transparency should help the Fed attain its goals of full employment and price\nstability. Currently, significant excess capacity in the economy risks lowering inflation and\ninflation expectations. Since short-term interest rates are effectively zero, reductions in inflation\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nexpectations imply a higher real interest rate – and, effectively, tighter monetary policy. So the\nadditional clarity on the long-run intentions of monetary policy (as reflected in the longer-range\nforecasts) might keep inflation expectations well anchored4 and real interest rates low enough to\nhelp get the economy moving again.\nAn important consideration involves what the long-run goal for inflation should be, given\nrecent experience. Twice this decade, short-term interest rates have approached zero, and the\nprobability of possible deflation has risen significantly. In light of this experience, some might\nconclude that the implicit inflation target has been too low. A fruitful area for future research\nwould be to re-consider the likelihood and the cost of hitting the zero lower bound, and what that\ncost implies for setting inflation targets.5\nBut now I would like to spend a bit of time discussing a second, alternative approach to\nmonetary policy that the Fed has been pursuing. Since the fall of last year the Federal Reserve\nhas rapidly increased its balance sheet, from $880 billion in July 2007 to $1.9 trillion as of last\nWednesday, February 18. While this expansion of the balance sheet is unprecedented, and gives\nsome observers pause, it is worth taking the time to understand the sources of that growth, the\ngoals behind that growth, and how the Federal Reserve balance sheet can be expected to\neventually return to a more normal size, due to market developments and Federal Reserve\nactions.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nExpansion of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nFigure 2 shows the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. While this period of\nfinancial turmoil began in August 2007, much of the initial activity by the Federal Reserve\ninvolved traditional monetary policy – reducing the federal funds rate. Then in 2008, the Federal\nReserve began what became a series of actions that expanded our usual “discount window”\nfunction. While the discount window had traditionally been available to depository institutions,\nin the spring of 2008 investment banks gained access to the discount window through the\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF).\nThe largest expansion of the balance sheet occurred in the wake of the Lehman Brothers\nfailure, as a series of actions were taken in response to the increasingly fragile state of financial\nmarkets. The three most significant areas of growth were discount window lending, foreign\nswap lines, and actions taken to stabilize financial markets.\nThe discount window lending I am referring to includes traditional discount window\nloans, primary dealer discount window loans, and lending in the Term Auction Facility (TAF).\nThe largest category of lending in this group is the TAF, which as of February 18 had $448\nbillion in loans outstanding. This Fed lending has been critical to the reduction in market interest\nrates that are charged in the interbank lending market.\nThese TAF loans are arranged through an auction process, and like regular discount\nwindow lending, are loans to banks that are in satisfactory condition and are also backed by\ncollateral subject to significant “haircuts,” to mitigate risk to the Federal Reserve. In\nconsidering how we get to a more normal-sized balance sheet, it is important to note that TAF\nlending is likely to fall once financial conditions become more normalized, although the Fed\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncould also hasten the reduction by holding smaller auctions or charging a higher minimum stopout rate.\nThe second area of substantial balance sheet growth involves central bank liquidity\nswaps. These are loans made to foreign central banks so they can provide dollar funding to their\nbanks in much the same manner as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s TAF. Why we are doing this?\nBecause global dollar markets are interlinked, and dollar markets overseas affect our own\ndomestic financial conditions. Our counterparties are the other central banks, not individual\nfinancial institutions, and the swaps are essentially loans.\nAs the interbank dollar-lending market has stabilized – and given that the rates on the\nloans by foreign central banks are often set to make them less attractive as markets stabilize –\nthis lending has fallen from a peak of $583 billion on December 17 to $375 billion on February\n18. This second area of balance sheet growth also is likely to decline naturally as more normal\nmarket functioning resumes.\nThe third area of substantial balance-sheet growth involves the Federal Reserve liquidity\nfacilities designed to provide market support (see Figure 3). These facilities are designed to\nimprove conditions in short-term credit markets. Some, like the Commercial Paper Funding\nFacility (CPFF), provide an alternative funding source to the market when interest rate spreads\nbecome very elevated. With this facility in place, when interest spreads are high firms have an\nincentive to issue commercial paper directly to the Federal Reserve. When interest spreads are\nlow, issuers will get a better rate by going to the market, thus unwinding the facility and\nshrinking the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nOther facilities like the Asset-backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility (AMLF) serve as a back-up for holders of existing short-term credit\ninstruments. Both the CPFF and AMLF experienced substantial lending when the programs\nwere first made available, but loan activity has declined as market conditions have improved.\nIn general, the various programs that have expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet\nshould be less attractive to market participants as financial conditions improve. Figure 4 shows\nthat of late, the rate on asset-backed commercial paper has fallen dramatically, and many issuers\ncan receive better terms by issuing commercial paper directly to the market. Figure 5 shows that\nthe prime money market funds have tended of late to have a net inflow of funds, which has\nhelped stabilize short-term credit markets because money market funds are a key investor in\nthese markets.\nTwo new programs should provide additional help to markets. First, the Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is designed to provide a financing vehicle for credit\ninstruments that have been disrupted by poor functioning in securitization markets. This facility,\nwhich will commence operations soon, should make credit more available for student loans,\nconsumer credit, commercial real estate, and small business loans.\nA second program involves the large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed and agency\nsecurities. For a variety of reasons, mortgage rates had not fallen in response to the decline in\nthe federal funds rate, as is usually the case. As shown in Figure 6, conventional mortgage rates\nthat had been around 6 percent have declined since the announcement of the program. Mortgage\nrates have been between 5 and 5.25 percent recently. Of course, an additional policy action that\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncould potentially be undertaken by the Federal Reserve would be to expand this program, to help\nfurther lower the market rates on home financing.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I offer just a few summary thoughts. Over the last year and a half or so,\nthe Federal Reserve has been proactive and innovative in trying to address problems in financial\nmarkets and the broader economy. While traditional monetary policy had focused on targeting\nthe federal funds rate, now that this rate has approached the zero-bound the Federal Reserve has\nfocused on other ways to lower the cost of credit in the marketplace, which had not fallen\ncommensurate with the decline in the federal funds rate. Federal Reserve programs have\nintended to offset disruptions to interbank lending, short-term credit financing, the ability of\nmoney market mutual funds to meet investor redemption requests, and housing finance – to\nbenefit all participants in the economy.\nIt is very important to note that the largest components of the expansion of the Federal\nReserve balance sheet are likely to become unappealing to market participants as financial\nconditions improve and interest rate spreads decline. Thus, much of the Fed’s balance-sheet\nexpansion should be reversed as we see the return of more normal trading.\nAs a student of the Japanese financial crisis, allow me to make one final point. The socalled “quantitative easing” that focused on increasing reserves in Japan during the 1990s, while\nwell-intentioned, in hindsight suggests that merely increasing reserves when financial\nintermediaries are capital-constrained is unlikely to have much impact.6\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, February 27, 2009\n2:00 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn contrast, the Federal Reserve programs I have described today are intended to reduce\nthe unusually large spreads created by financial disruptions, so that the cost of credit for a variety\nof borrowers returns to the level we would expect with more normalized functioning of credit\nmarkets. The Federal Reserve’s recent monetary policy actions, combined with the fiscal\nstimulus package that the government recently enacted, should in my view help pull the\neconomy out of the severe recession we have been experiencing.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nSee the minutes of the January 2009 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee and the\naddendum, a Summary of Economic Projections, available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20090128.pdf\n\n2\n\nSee the minutes of the January 2009 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee and the\naddendum, a Summary of Economic Projections, available at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20090128.pdf\n\n3\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090218a.htm\n\n4\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke noted in a speech on February 18 (available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090218a.htm), “This further extension of\nthe quarterly projections should provide the public a clearer picture of FOMC participants' policy strategy\nfor promoting maximum employment and price stability over time. Also, increased clarity about the\nFOMC's views regarding longer-term inflation should help to better stabilize the public's inflation\nexpectations, thus contributing to keeping actual inflation from rising too high or falling too low.”\n\n5\n\nA number of papers written in the late 1990s provided estimates of the likelihood of hitting and/or being\npinned at the zero lower bound (see, for example, Reifschneider and Williams, “Three Lessons for\nMonetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, vol. 32 (November\n2000), pp. 936-66). With hindsight, the estimates in these papers appear a bit optimistic.\n6\n\nOf course, some observers believe quantitative easing was more appropriate in Japan because of its\nmore bank-centric financial system.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 1\nFederal Funds Effective Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - February 20, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 2\nComposition of Federal Reserve System Assets\nJune 27, 2007 - February 18, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n\n\fFigure 3\nFederal Reserve System Assets\nHeld by Market Support Facilities\nSeptember 24, 2008 - February 18, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1\n\n\fFigure 4\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - February 20, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 5\nDaily Change in Money Market Fund Assets\nin Prime Funds\nAugust 1, 2008 - February 20, 2009\n\nSource: iMoneyNet\n\n\fFigure 6\nNational Average Mortgage Rates\nSeptember 2, 2008 - February 20, 2009\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nMassachusetts Mortgage Bankers Association\n2009 Annual Dinner\n\nJanuary 8, 2009\nWest Newton, Massachusetts\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you this evening. We all know that housing and mortgage\nlending have played central roles in the dramatic economic and financial developments of the\nlast year and a half. As a central banker, I welcome opportunities to meet with and hear from\nyou in the industry, and to share my views on housing markets, the economy, and policy options\nwith you. 1 So I thank you for inviting me to join you this evening.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nBy way of introduction, I would like to make a few observations on the economic\nsituation. With the holidays concluded, it is clear that sales fell short of expectations for many\nretailers. Despite significant discounting it seems that consumers, worried about the economy\nand their own economic situation, curtailed their spending. Indeed, it appears that the economy\ncontracted quite significantly in the final quarter of 2008, and may continue contracting over the\nfirst half of 2009. We are seeing businesses retrenching and unemployment rising, and many of\nour international trading partners expect equally grim results.\nAs a result, this recession looks to be longer and more severe than was originally\nforecast. Still, there are indications that the second half of the year will show improvement.\nConsider several developments. Energy prices have fallen dramatically, making it much\nless expensive to drive cars or heat homes, freeing up much-needed cash flow for many\nconsumers. Fiscal-stimulus packages being discussed in Washington could provide an economic\nboost. And monetary policy is also contributing. With the federal funds rate at historic lows, in\na range only slightly above zero, and various lending facilities helping to lower the elevated\nspreads on many interest rates, the result is that many short-term interest rates are now\nsignificantly below the levels seen at the end of the third quarter. Also, recent actions by the\nFederal Reserve to reduce mortgage rates are having an impact, with mortgage rates already\nfalling about 100 basis points from the end of the third quarter. While all of these developments\nwill take a little time to fully impact the economy, they should be sowing the seeds for a\nrecovery later in 2009.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nObservations on the Housing Market\nNow I would like to turn to the focus of my remarks, the housing market. By way of\ncontext, residential investment 2 has been declining since the first quarter of 2006 (see Figure 1,\nwhich plots the quarterly percent change), and this decline in residential investment is already of\nnotable length and depth relative to previous housing downturns. 3\nIt goes without saying that it is important to the broader economy that the housing market\nstabilizes. Normally, housing markets decline because mortgage interest rates have risen and the\nhigher cost of obtaining a mortgage weighs down residential investment. During more normal\ntimes, the Federal Reserve can address this by reducing the federal funds rate, a step that usually\nhelps to lower mortgage rates – and the housing market improves.\nBut this housing downturn is different. Increasingly, the housing market is impacted\nmore by the availability of credit than the cost of credit.\nBorrowers who have poor credit histories or little equity in their homes are having\ndifficulty finding mortgages – even higher-rate mortgages. Borrowers looking for home equity\nloans or seeking to refinance are finding that falling housing prices have reduced their ability to\nborrow against the value of their home. Borrowers that stretched to purchase or refinance their\nhome are finding it difficult to stay current on mortgage payments if a family member is laid off\nor assigned reduced hours, or if other problems strike the household.\nGiven all these factors, it is important to recognize that no one solution is likely to fix our\nhousing market challenges. And let me be clear, I am not for a moment suggesting the return of\nlax underwriting standards. Rather, I am suggesting that with a variety of well-designed\napproaches, tailored to current problems, the housing market can and should stabilize – by which\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nI mean easing the difficulties with the cost and availability of mortgage credit that we are seeing,\nwhich in turn would support housing markets more generally.\nI plan tonight to first discuss some recent trends in the housing market. I will then touch\non actions that could influence the cost of financing for housing. I will then discuss some actions\nthat could influence the availability of financing for housing – especially for troubled borrowers\n– before offering a few concluding remarks.\n\nI.\n\nRecent Trends in Housing\nAs Figure 2 illustrates, single-family housing starts have declined precipitously from\n\ntheir peak in January 2006. The extent of the decline is so striking, in part, because of the large\nincreases in housing starts that occurred over this decade. But housing starts are at their lowest\nlevel in the past 50 years – and many private forecasters suggest they have not yet bottomed out.\nOf course, the decline in housing starts is playing a necessary role in reducing the excess\ninventory of new homes for sale. As shown in Figure 3, there has been a substantial decline in\nthat inventory – although at 374,000 units for sale as of November, new homes for sale still\nremain above the historical average.\nSales have declined for new homes of all price ranges. For the most expensive homes,\n“jumbo” mortgage rates remain very elevated relative to conventional mortgages. At the other\nend of the spectrum, purchasers of the least expensive homes are having great difficulty securing\nfinancing if they have little down payment equity, or low credit scores.\nA critical aspect of the current situation has been the disruption of the securitization 4\nprocess, where mortgages are sold to be part of a security backed by many (pooled) mortgages,\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nand re-sold onto the secondary market to investors. For expensive homes that are financed with\njumbo mortgages, the disruptions in securitization have caused rates on jumbo mortgages to rise\neven while the federal funds rate has dropped sharply. Prior to the financial-market disruptions\nthat began in August 2007, jumbo mortgage rates had moved closely with conventional mortgage\nrates, with an approximately 25 basis-point premium over conventional mortgages (see Figure\n4). However, the spread became quite large as securitizing jumbo mortgages became\nincreasingly difficult. Many jumbo mortgages were provided by portfolio lenders who began to\ndemand a premium over what they had required when the loans could be more easily securitized.\nThe current government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) cut-off for jumbo mortgages is\n$417,000 nationally, although the limit is $625,500 in some areas with particularly high costs of\nhousing 5 and is somewhere between $417,000 and $625,000 in certain cities and counties. In\nplaces with a relatively high cost of housing, the large premium for jumbo mortgages is a\ndeterrent to home purchases. Raising the maximum amount on conforming mortgages would\nlikely go some way towards reducing this spread, by making it easier for the industry to\nsecuritize home loans and thus for borrowers to purchase homes in regions where housing costs\nare high.\nOf course, securitization is also disrupted for subprime 6 and Alt-A loans. The result has\nbeen that borrowers with limited down-payments, low credit scores, or other issues are finding it\nincreasingly difficult to obtain mortgage financing – even at rates well above conventional prime\nmortgages.\nWith the securitization market not seeming ready to recover in the near term, one thinks\nof the traditional way that low- and moderate-income borrowers qualified for mortgages prior to\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nthe expansion of the subprime market – through Federal Housing Administration (FHA) lending\nprograms. They alleviate some of the risk of lending to borrowers who can only afford a small\ndown payment and therefore might have difficulty obtaining a conventional mortgage product.\nHowever, many would say that FHA lending has a reputation for bureaucracy and\nunwieldiness. By many accounts, FHA has been working to address this, and there have been\nsignificant modifications made to traditional FHA lending programs. At the Boston Fed we have\ndeveloped a brief guide with questions and answers that may be helpful to institutions\nconsidering becoming an FHA lender – either a correspondent or a full mortgagee. 7 The\nresource is available on our website. 8\nFHA mortgage lending expanded quite significantly in the latter half of 2008. Still, many\nbanks remain unwilling to participate. Making these programs more accessible to borrowers and\nbanks would help ensure that low- and moderate-income borrowers can obtain financing, which\nshould help stabilize the market for lower-priced homes.\n\nII.\n\nPolicies that Influence the Cost of Financing for Housing\nAs we consider steps that could assist the recovery of housing markets, I would now like\n\nto share some perspectives on the potential for policies to influence the cost of financing for\nhousing. Over the past 18 months, the Federal Reserve aggressively lowered the federal funds\nrate, as financial problems worsened and the economic outlook deteriorated. But despite\naggressive easing, many interest rates in the marketplace remained high, or rose – thus, the\n“spreads” between overnight fed funds and many rates in the marketplace widened considerably.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nThese elevated spreads reflected investors’ pessimism about the economic outlook and\nlack of liquidity in many financial markets. The lack of liquidity raised investors’ concerns\nabout their ability to resell financial assets other than Treasury securities without very steep\ndiscounts. This has been particularly evident for assets with longer maturities, lower credit\nquality, or structured financing. The sharply discounted sale prices on some mortgage-backed\nsecurities implied a very bleak outlook for default experience.\nWhile the federal funds rate declined substantially over the past 18 months, the rates that\nmany borrowers paid to finance assets rose, or declined by much less than would have been\nexpected given the decline in the federal funds rate. This unusually large widening of interestrate spreads implies that the transmission mechanism for monetary policy has been impacted. If\nthe goal of monetary policy is to avoid severe economic problems and maintain liquid markets,\nthe evident disruption to the transmission mechanism implies that more than just a lower base\nrate is needed.\nSo, over the past year the Federal Reserve System designed a variety of liquidity\nfacilities, aimed in large part at reducing the interest rate spreads on short-term, high-quality\nassets. In particular, the interbank loan market (as reflected in the London Interbank Offered\nRate or LIBOR) and the market for short-term commercial paper saw extremely high spreads, as\nFigures 5 and 6 show. Because the central bank established a variety of liquidity facilities\ndesigned to address these markets, the spreads have declined substantially. Further evidence of\nreduced stress in short-term markets comes from the Federal Reserve’s Term Auction Facility\n(TAF), where the auctions have recently been under-subscribed and stop-out rates have been\nequal to the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nAs investors become more confident that they can sell assets if needed, the premium on\nliquidity falls, and interest spreads decline. By supporting short-term credit markets, the Federal\nReserve is signaling its determination to take appropriate actions to prevent “seize-ups” in\nfinancial markets, reducing the risk premium. In short, we have seen improvements of late in the\nfunctioning of many short-term credit markets, and I expect this improvement will continue.\nImprovements in short-term credit markets do have indirect effects on the housing\nmarket. Some mortgages, particularly sub-prime loans, were tied to the six-month LIBOR rate.\nAs short-term rates have fallen, those who either refinance or whose adjustable rate mortgages\nadjust are suffering smaller payment shocks.\nHowever, many interest rates remained relatively unresponsive to the decline in the\nfederal funds rate. Figure 7 shows that during 2007 and the first half of 2008, mortgage rates\nremained around 6 percent and the rates on “Baa” rated corporate bonds actually rose. As\nconditions in the short-term credit markets have started to improve, and as the base federal funds\nrate is trading between 0 and 25 basis points, it seems that improving housing finance is likely to\ntake concerted fiscal and monetary policy actions.\nOn the fiscal side, it is possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could play a more\nsignificant role in restoring liquidity and providing a secondary market for mortgages that reflect\nthe lower cost of funds in many credit markets. Further exploration of the GSEs’ options for\npricing and programs may result in additional support to the mortgage market.\nOn the monetary policy side, the Federal Reserve announced on November 25 that it\nwould be buying up to $100 billion in GSE direct obligations, and up to $500 billion in\nmortgage-backed securities. 9 A subsequent announcement on December 30 provided more\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\ndetails. 10 Since the announcement of the program, designed to reduce the recently widening rate\nspreads on GSE debt and on GSE-guaranteed mortgages, mortgage rates have declined (see\nFigure 8). Some mortgages in Boston are now available for under 5 percent.\nLower mortgage rates help alleviate the current problems in several ways. First,\npotential home buyers have the possibility of buying their homes with the lowest rates in the past\n30 years. Because interest rates may only be lower temporarily, they provide an incentive for\nbuyers to purchase now rather than wait in the hope that home prices fall more. In terms of cash\nflow, locking in a lower rate now may be more important than potentially buying the home at a\nsomewhat lower price, later. Obviously, getting buyers “off the sidelines” and back into the\nmarket is critical for a housing market recovery. Second, the lower rates provide the opportunity\nto refinance. This can improve cash flow, freeing up household resources to fix up the home or\nconsume other items. Third, lower rates have the advantage of benefiting credit-worthy\nborrowers as well as more troubled homebuyers.\nLow mortgage rates primarily benefit home buyers with significant equity for a down\npayment and good credit scores, and borrowers that seek to refinance and still have significant\nequity in their house as well as good credit scores. However, if prices stabilize, home owners\nand holders of mortgage instruments will benefit. Since stabilizing the housing market is critical,\nexpanded use of policies that address the cost of housing finance may give further impetus for\nnew home buyers and existing mortgage holders to take advantage of what are very low rates by\nhistorical standards.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nIII.\n\nTroubled Homebuyers and the Availability of Financing for Housing\nNow a few comments on the availability of home finance. Clearly, there are many\n\nborrowers that are unlikely to fully benefit from the aforementioned lower mortgage rates,\nbecause they have negative home equity or poor credit scores. It can be helpful to think of these\ntroubled borrowers in segments. There are those who are stressed but still making their\npayments, despite impaired credit scores or home equity; those who are temporarily unable to\nmake payments (for example because of reduced hours, a spell of unemployment, or health\nissues); and those whose inability to make the payments is not temporary, but permanent.\nDifferent approaches are probably necessary for borrowers in these different circumstances.\nFor borrowers who continue to make payments but are under stress and unable to ease\ntheir payment burden through refinance (perhaps because they cannot provide a significant down\npayment), one possibility is to improve access to FHA loans. During the subprime boom, many\nlenders stopped providing FHA loans. 11 Improving access to FHA programs, and providing\ngreater incentive for bankers to provide FHA loans, could help many borrowers gain access to\nthe market at relatively favorable rates. Since many banks have been raising their minimum\ncredit score to qualify for mortgages, the FHA may be able to provide loans for borrowers whose\ncredit history is not up to current thresholds, yet have the capacity to make payments.\nDuring a recession like the current one it becomes increasingly common for borrowers to\nexperience temporary setbacks. A family member might lose a job, have hours reduced, or no\nlonger get overtime. These can all present significant difficulties, and these problems can be\ncompounded if a family member encounters significant health issues. For such individuals, steps\nsuch as deferring payments or reducing interest rates can prevent foreclosure. By providing a\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\ntemporary or permanent reduction in payments, the lender can avoid foreclosure and bridge the\nborrower through a difficult period. Of course, with a job loss and loss of income the required\npayment reduction, while temporary, can be quite significant, on the order of 50 percent. For\nthis type of borrower, small modifications are unlikely to prevent foreclosures.\nThe United Kingdom has announced a program that focuses on borrowers facing\ntemporary challenges – allowing lenders to reduce interest payments, with the deferred payments\nadded to the principal and paid when the borrower’s circumstances improve. 12 The British\ngovernment guarantees the lender against a percentage of the deferred interest payments. In a\nsimilar vein, a proposal developed by several Federal Reserve economists, and available on our\nwebsite, 13 suggests that the U.S. government could pay a significant portion of monthly\npayments for borrowers who are facing severe but temporary financial setbacks. There are two\nvariants to the proposal. One way in which such a plan might work is for the government to\noffer these borrowers temporary loans that must be paid back once the borrower returns to\nfinancial health. Another version of this plan calls for the government to offer grants, not loans,\nto borrowers who have adverse life events, such as job loss.\nImportantly, both versions include aspects that will minimize the number of people who\nwould sign up for government help when they do not really need it. 14 While any extension of\ndirect government assistance to borrowers has potential “moral hazard” problems, the mere\npotential for such problems should not automatically derail proposals that are likely to keep\ntemporarily troubled borrowers in their homes.\nOf course, variants of these proposals are currently being used by mortgage servicers. At\nan event at Gillette Stadium last August, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in conjunction with\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nthe Kraft family, the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, the HOPE NOW Alliance,\nand NeighborWorks America brought troubled borrowers together with mortgage servicers to\nhelp address preventable foreclosures. The results, based on follow-up contacts with a subset of\nthe 2,200-plus borrowers that attended the event, are shown in Figure 9. A little more than onethird of borrowers, about 35 percent, received some type of modification or workout offer from\nservicers. The most prevalent type was a loan modification that reduced monthly payments,\nwhich was received by 27 percent of borrowers. These were achieved by reductions in interest\nrates or by plans that lowered payments on a temporary basis. Only in very rare cases was the\noutstanding balance of the mortgage reduced.\nAllow me to make an important parenthetical note. As mortgage rates decline, the ability\nof servicers to provide these interest rate concessions to borrowers should increase.\nLarge foreclosure-prevention events like this are one way to bring troubled borrowers\ntogether with servicers, since borrowers often complain they have difficulty reaching servicers\nand servicers complain that many borrowers do not open mail or return calls. Indeed, we at the\nBoston Fed will soon be announcing another such foreclosure-prevention workshop, to be held in\nConnecticut. While such events can play an important role, I think we would all agree that more\nsystematic approaches or programs are desirable to reach a larger number of troubled borrowers.\nThe third pool of troubled borrowers involves those that realistically are not going to be\nable to make their mortgage payments. In such cases, it may well be impossible for lenders and\nborrowers to work out a plan. But that does not mean that nothing can be done to make the best\nof a difficult situation, for the borrower as well as their neighbors and the housing market in their\narea. One possibility is to provide borrowers who have little or no housing equity and are unable\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nto make mortgage payments with assistance to move to a rental property. Some may eventually\nhave the capacity to purchase a home that is affordable to them, while for others, renting may be\nthe appropriate long-term solution. But there is an important role for stabilization in highforeclosure communities and a need to put foreclosed properties back to productive use, whether\nfor rental or homeownership. An alternative would involve the government making a significant\nfinancial commitment that makes the mortgage affordable on terms acceptable to the lender – but\nthe cost of such a program would likely be very high. 15\n\nConclusion\nThe housing market has played a significant role in current economic problems. But with\nappropriate steps, the housing market could stabilize this year. The recent reductions in\nmortgage rates, in part due to monetary policy actions, have enabled more borrowers than would\notherwise have done so to purchase or refinance homes. Expansion of this effort, and\nencouraging greater GSE participation, should encourage borrowers that have equity and\nreasonable credit scores to purchase or refinance homes.\nFor more troubled borrowers, programs will need to be designed to address the specific\nnature of their problem. For some borrowers, greater use of FHA programs may be appropriate;\nwhile for others, interest rate concessions that are now more affordable for lenders may serve as\na bridge for the temporarily impaired.\nLet me conclude by making a point that should not be overlooked. Although it is a\ndiscussion for another day, we need to remember that once the market has stabilized, much work\nneeds to be done to structure mortgage securitization in a way that that reduces the likelihood of\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nfuture episodes of significant upheaval in mortgage finance. And more generally, financial\nregulatory reform will also be a key policy topic this year.\nThank you and I wish you the very best in the year ahead.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nResidential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is essentially\nthe value of goods and services put in place during a time period. “The main indicator of the quantity of\nnew housing supplied to the economy is the residential fixed investment series from the national income\nand product accounts. Residential investment is made up of new construction put in place, expenditures\non maintenance and home improvement, equipment purchased for use in residential structures (e.g.,\nwashers and dryers purchased by landlords and rented out to tenants), and brokerage commissions.”\n(Source: “Residential Investment over the Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter #2006-15; June 30, 2006).\n\n3\n\nI offered a more extensive historical perspective on housing downturns in a January 2008 speech\navailable at http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/011108.htm.\n4\n\nAs I have pointed out in prior talks, mortgages that used to be held at local banks came to be originated\nby mortgage companies that reach out to borrowers through brokers, and then sell the mortgage to be part\nof a security backed by many mortgages. Mortgages were pooled and securitized, then split and re-sold\nonto the secondary market to investors. Servicing companies act as intermediaries between the borrowers\n– the person making the monthly mortgage payment, and the ultimate investor. The securities are\ngoverned by complex pooling and servicing agreements that vary in terms of what they allow.\n\n5\n\nThe economic stimulus bill passed earlier in 2008 raised the loan limits to nearly $729,750 in certain\nhigh-cost areas. However, in 2009, this limit for high-cost areas fell to $625,500. The $625,500 number is\n150% of the traditional limit for GSE securitization ($417,000), which remains unchanged from 2008.\n6\n\nIn essence “subprime” loans refer to mortgages that have a higher risk of default than prime loans, often\nbecause of the borrowers’ credit history. Certain lenders may specialize in subprime loans, which carry\nhigher interest rates reflecting the higher risk. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do\nnot make subprime loans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage\nbanking subsidiaries. According to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to\nthe credit characteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit\nhistories [and] may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income\nratios, or other criteria… Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Thursday, January 8, 2009\n7:15 P.M. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\ncharacteristics at the time of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to\nprime borrowers.”\n7\n\nAn FHA mortgagee can originate, underwrite, fund, service, and/or own FHA-insured loans. An FHA\nloan correspondent can only originate loans that are underwritten by their sponsoring mortgagee.\n\n8\n\nThe guide – Frequently Asked Questions on FHA Lending: Business Considerations Regarding the\nDecision to Become an FHA Lender – is available on the Boston Fed's website at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/bankinfo.\n\n9\n\nThe November 25 announcement is available at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm\n\n10\n\nThe December 30 announcement is available at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081230b.htm\n11\n\nIn a speech in December 2007 I discussed FHA lending trends in more detail. The speech is available\nat http://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2007/120307.htm#_ednref9\n12\n\nA description of the program (“The Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme”) is available at\nhttp://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_135_08.htm\n13\n\nThe proposal, developed by Federal Reserve economists Chris Foote, Jeff Fuhrer, and Paul Willen\n(Federal Reserve Bank of Boston) and Eileen Mauskopf (Federal Reserve Board), will be available on the\nBoston Fed's website at http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/index.htm.\n14\n\nIn the first version of the plan, which extends government loans, the interest rate on these loans would\nbe set high enough so that only people who really need help will want to sign up for them. In the second\nversion, which extends grants, participation would be predicated on an adverse life event such as job loss.\nGiven the difficult state of the labor market, relatively few people are likely to quit their jobs or refuse to\ntake new ones in order to save some fraction of their monthly mortgage payment.\n\n15\n\nSo any such program would need very carefully framed public policy objectives, careful and\nappropriate screening of potential applicants, and well-designed program terms.\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 1\nReal Residential Investment\n1959:Q1 - 2008:Q3\n\nSource: BEA / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 2\nSingle-Family Housing Starts\nJanuary 1959 - November 2008\n\nSource: Census Bureau / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 3\nNew Single-Family Homes for Sale\nJanuary 1963 - November 2008\n\nSource: Census Bureau / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 4\nNational Average Mortgage Rates\nJanuary 2, 2006 - January 6, 2009\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\fFigure 5\nShort Term Interest Rate Spread\nJanuary 2, 2007 - January 6, 2009\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 6\nShort Term Interest Rate Spread\nJanuary 2, 2007 - January 6, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 7\nCorporate Bond Yields, Mortgage Rates, and\nthe Federal Funds Effective Rate\nJanuary 2, 2007 - January 6, 2009\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Bloomberg /Haver Analytics\n\n\fFigure 8\nNational Average Mortgage Rates\nSeptember 2, 2008 - January 6, 2009\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\fFigure 9\nBorrowers Receiving Loan Workouts at\n(or after) Gillette Stadium Event\n\nSource: FRB Boston Survey of Borrowers Attending Gillette Stadium Event\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nICBI RiskMinds 2008 Conference:\nThe Global Risk Regulation Summit\n\nDecember 8, 2008\nGeneva, Switzerland\n\nI am very pleased to be with you today, as it is a particularly appropriate time for all of us\nto be at a conference focused on risk management and risk modeling for financial institutions. 1\nAs you know, many banks around the world have, of late, found themselves needing equity\ninfusions from governments, or expanded guarantees for their liabilities.\nA widespread need for banks’ recapitalization has occurred at least twice in the past\ncentury, and in many countries has occurred much more frequently than that. Many banks’ risk\nmodels were supposed to be calibrated for “once-in-a-thousand-years” events; however, these\nmodels seriously underestimated risk.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nCertainly there is much still to study and understand about the recent financial turmoil\nthat emerged in the summer of 2007. But it seems abundantly clear, and not all that surprising,\nthat risks calibrated from a few years of data from good times can dramatically under-estimate\nrisk exposure for a particular asset, as well as the high correlation of risks across asset classes\nduring periods of significant stress. Furthermore, while capital models were intended to suggest\nminimum capital requirements that would keep institutions sound during risky times, the models\nwere frequently used to justify expansion of dividends and stock buybacks, because they\nsuggested that banks were overcapitalized during boom times. So this conference occurs at a\ngood time, as we all try to re-evaluate how best to model and manage risk.\nAnd it is not only our risk models that need to be reevaluated. Our regulatory framework\nclearly needs to be reconsidered, in light of recent events. Both in the U.S. and globally, we had\nin place a complex set of regulations and supervisory structures intended, in part, to increase the\nlikelihood that financial intermediaries would remain well capitalized without government\nassistance. Like the risk models, bank regulators did not foresee the dramatic illiquidity that\ncould emerge during a period of acute financial turmoil – nor the changes in the value of assets\non balance sheets, or the degree of correlation of those asset values.\nWhile regulatory reform proposals are already beginning to surface, I see value in first\nevaluating the principles that should frame the discussion. Before we begin to work on\nregulatory details we need to evaluate whether the problem was poor execution of a wellconsidered regulatory framework, or that important principles were absent from the framework.\nWhile in my view the recent experience shows elements of both, I want to focus today on\nregulatory principles rather than their implementation.\nBut before discussing regulatory principles, I would like to briefly discuss our current\neconomic situation, in order to put the recent crises in context.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nRecent Economic Conditions\n\nMany countries have already experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP\ngrowth and the NBER has recently declared that the U.S. entered the recession at the end of last\nyear. In the U.S., GDP in the second quarter was positive, helped in part by a fiscal stimulus\npackage. In the third quarter, GDP declined by 0.5 percent, and it looks like in the fourth quarter\nit will decline somewhat more significantly – since consumer and investment spending appear to\nbe dropping quite precipitously. This is due, in part, to the interplay of developments in asset\nmarkets and the real economy. U.S. consumers – and, increasingly, consumers across Europe –\nhave been buffeted by declining housing prices and falling stock prices. The resulting loss of\nconsumer wealth, coupled with a rapidly rising unemployment rate, suggests the holiday buying\nseason will not be robust as was hoped earlier this year.\nThe likelihood of further weakening of labor markets, and a reluctance of consumers or\nbusinesses to increase spending until economic conditions are more certain, together imply a\ncontinued difficult environment for banks. There are several conditions necessary for financial\nmarkets to resume a more normal state, and I would like to briefly discuss each.\nFirst, we need short-term credit markets to return to normalcy. Conditions in short-term\ncredit markets have improved significantly since the end of September. As shown in Figure 1,\nrates in the market for high-grade financial commercial paper have resumed a more normal\nrelationship to the Federal Funds rate target, compared to the mid September to mid October\ntimeframe. This improvement in what was a very large spread has been greatly aided by the\nvarious short-term credit facilities established by the Federal Reserve to help reduce the stress in\nshort-term credit markets. These facilities have also enhanced the ability of financial firms and\nissuers of commercial paper to extend the maturities on commercial paper issues (see Figure 2),\nwhich at the end of September had become dependent on overnight financing. The facilities\nhave also reduced the risk that financing would not be available over the year end, as many\ncommercial-paper issuers have now financed themselves beyond that point. But despite these\nimprovements, short-term credit markets remain strained. Figure 3 shows that the spread\nbetween Libor 2 and the Overnight Index Swap rate has fallen from its late-September peak but\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nremains well above the level that prevailed prior to the outbreak of financial turmoil in summer\nof 2007.\nSecond, we need to see some improvement in the housing market before financial markets\nwill resume a more normal state. In the U.S., residential investment began declining in the first\nquarter of 2006 and has declined in each quarter since. And as Figure 4 shows, house prices\nhave declined nationally, and in some markets the declines have already exceeded 25 percent. A\nnumber of proposals have been floated to help stem foreclosures, but to date there has been\nrelatively modest progress – faced, as we are, by the dual problems of falling housing prices and\nrising unemployment. Stabilization in house prices and a drop in foreclosures would help the\noverall economy as well as the banking sector that is exposed to construction loans, residential\nmortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities.\nThird, officials must take into account – and develop policies and actions that reflect –\nthe degree to which monetary policy tools are currently deployed. The stance of U.S. monetary\npolicy reflects our rate reductions, with the Federal Funds rate target currently at 100 basis\npoints. Given that interest rates cannot be negative, further monetary-policy actions are limited\nby the zero lower bound for interest rates. While other monetary policy tools can be employed,\nincreasingly many observers and commentators are suggesting that fiscal stimulus will be an\nimportant element of economic recovery.\n\nPrinciples to Guide the Design of Regulatory Structure\n\nWith actions already taken to stabilize short-term credit conditions, and the widelyreported likelihood of further fiscal measures, I would hope that over the next year there can be a\nbroader discussion of lessons learned from our recent problems, and what measures can be taken\nto reduce the risk of a recurrence. There can sometimes be a tendency to move to proposals for\nregulatory design before building a consensus on the underlying principles that should guide the\ndebate. To that end, I would like to use my remaining time to discuss a few key principles that I\nhope will inform the many proposals that are likely to emerge.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 1:\nFinancial regulation must be more clearly focused on the key goal of macroeconomic stability\nas well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions.\nI lead with this principle, because I believe it has not necessarily received sufficient\nattention in our current regulatory structures. There is a clear link between the financial\nregulation of institutions and the stability of markets and the macroeconomy. Some countries\nhave had frequent and severe banking crises, while other countries have been much more\nsuccessful at weathering periods of international financial turmoil.\nOn the one hand, too conservative a regime of financial regulation can stymie innovation\nand creativity, thus preventing borrowers and lenders from interacting in the most efficient ways.\nOn the other hand, inadequate oversight can cause periods of financial turmoil that are quite\ndestructive to the financial infrastructure and the real economy. Future regulatory design must\nallow for innovation without increasing risks to the financial infrastructure and the real economy.\nPrinciple 2:\nBecause it is a key determinant of macroeconomic stability, systemic financial stability must\nreceive greater focus, with roles and responsibilities during a financial crisis more clearly\narticulated.\nRegulatory structures should be designed to minimize the probability of systemic\ndisruption or instability. In the future, the definition of a “systemically important” firm must be\nclear in advance, and the regulatory structure should be designed to minimize the chance that\nsuch firms will take actions that would put systemic stability at risk. In addition, should a crisis\narise despite the best efforts of regulators, the conditions and processes to “save” such firms must\nbe well understood in advance.\nImportantly, care must be given to the design of rescue options to minimize the incidence\nof moral hazard, or additional risk-taking by a party that is insured, “saved,” or otherwise\ninsulated from the consequences of its activities. Of course, the best way to avoid moral hazard\nis to avoid crisis situations in which organizations need “saving.” The next best way is to have\nwell-defined processes in place in advance, which minimize the effects of moral hazard. 3\nEssential to determining which institutions are systemically important is a comprehensive\nview of what you might call the “financial entanglements” – interdependencies – among\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nfinancial instruments and institutions. 4 In an ideal situation, financial institutions could fail or\nhave their assets transferred to other organizations with little disruption to counterparties or\nmarkets. Recent experience indicates that the uncertainty around counterparty risk in nonexchange-traded transactions is significant during periods of market stress. And it is difficult to\nascertain the true extent of counterparty risk and whether a failure will result in significant\ndisruptions in markets where the financial institution serves as a key player.\nIn the U.S., the central bank can provide liquidity to the marketplace, but decisions to\ntake on credit risk that pose substantial risks to taxpayers should ideally be in the hands of the\nTreasury Department, with oversight by Congress. However, during this period of financial\nturmoil the Treasury Department did not have the pre-existing authority to intervene\nexpeditiously in such a crisis situation. The result was that the central bank became directly\ninvolved in urgent, time-sensitive issues that involved significant credit risk.\nTo be better prepared for systemic problems, “standing” fiscal and monetary facilities are\nneeded, to provide the ability to react more quickly than was possible of late. Until the passage\nof the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. Treasury Department did not have the\nability to react to emerging problems as quickly as it would have liked. Similarly, many of the\nFederal Reserve facilities required significant accounting, legal, and back-office infrastructure\nthat took some time to put in place.\nIn addition, as you all know, liquidity has been provided to institutions and markets\nwhere previously the central bank had little direct regulatory involvement. For example,\nfacilities that were needed to provide liquidity to investment banks and money-market funds\nwere established despite the absence of direct regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve at the\ntime the facility was initiated. Also, markets such as those for asset-backed commercial paper\nand unsecured commercial paper were not markets in which the Federal Reserve was actively\nengaged prior to the crisis. In the future, it would be ideal to clarify in advance which\ninstitutions and markets could require liquidity, and make sure the central bank has sufficient\ninformation about these institutions and markets to better serve in its role as lender of last resort.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 3:\nLiquidity risk must receive greater policy focus in determining regulatory structures.\nAt the outset of the recent financial turmoil, many observers assumed that liquidity risk\nwas well contained. In the case of investment banks, many of their assets were financed by\nrepurchase agreements – short-term loans that were fully collateralized. Because the repurchase\nagreements were collateralized, most parties assumed there was a relatively low risk of a “run”\nbecause the collateral could always be sold in the event of a default. However, concerns with\nvaluations of assets used for repurchase agreements resulted in many investors refusing to\ncontinue to lend even overnight once the counterparty was feared to be at risk of failure.\nIn addition, money market mutual funds were assumed to have relatively little liquidity\nrisk, because they were constrained by regulations that compel them to hold only investmentgrade securities of short duration. However, after one well-known money market mutual fund\nannounced that its investors would not be able to redeem their entire principal (“breaking the\nbuck”), many funds faced a wave of redemption requests they had great difficulty meeting – until\naction was taken to put in place temporary U.S. Treasury insurance as well as a new Federal\nReserve liquidity facility.\nThe financial turmoil has highlighted the reality that our regulatory structure had not fully\nanticipated the types of liquidity shocks that have occurred. Going forward, more attention\nshould be focused on ensuring that the causes of liquidity disruptions are better understood, and\nthat we are better equipped to avoid liquidity problems. 5\nAlso, we must be cognizant of an issue that has compounded these liquidity problems –\nthe interaction with accounting rules. Regulatory and accounting frameworks need to consider\nhow best to address periods of sustained illiquidity.\nIn order to prevent bank runs, many countries have not only insured bank deposits but\nhave also guaranteed other liabilities. We need to better understand how best to structure\nliabilities to avoid the need for such debt guarantees in the future. In the recent turmoil, for\nmany institutions it was the unexpected lack of a stable and fluid market for short-term debt to\nfinance their balance sheets that created liquidity problems. 6\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nPrinciple 4:\nCareful thought must be given to coordinating the work of the various domestic and\ninternational regulators in the design of the regulatory structure.\nIn the United States there exists a patchwork of overlapping regulators. Much of our\nregulatory design results from reactions to the Great Depression. Given all the changes that have\noccurred since then, it is probably appropriate to take a fresh look at our regulatory structure –\nnot just the bank-regulatory agencies but also the inter-relationship of their work with that of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nIdeally, a new structure would minimize the adverse effects of competing regulatory\ngoals. It will also need to consider how different regulatory bodies can be better coordinated so\nthat information moves more freely between them. Also, international coordination is becoming\nmuch more important, as firms have become more global. And as with monetary policy, I\nbelieve that to the extent possible, creating independent regulatory agencies with clear mandates\nis critical to success.\n\nPrinciple 5:\nResponsibility for strengthening market infrastructure should receive more attention in\nregulatory design.\nThe current crisis has highlighted the need for better transparency. If every transaction is\nunique, it becomes difficult to determine valuations during periods of illiquidity. To the extent\npossible, contracts governing securitization should be standardized, with clearly defined steps to\nresolve competing interests when the underlying assets lose value.\nSimilarly, contracts between institutions provide less transparency than transactions\nthrough exchanges. Exchange-traded assets provide a price that is widely observable – on\ncontracts for assets that are clearly defined. To the extent that more assets move to be exchangetraded, counterparty risk is reduced, and transparency is increased.\nI also believe that payment and settlement activities need greater oversight. The backoffice difficulties involved in unwinding complex trades that were not exchange-traded highlight\nthe need for more attention to settlement activities.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, or upon delivery\n\nConclusion\n\nOf course, these five principles are not the only ones of import. Others may stress other\nvery worthy points taken from the lessons of the recent episode. For example that financial\nregulation must be grounded in an understanding of institutional relationships – “real world”\ndetails, which clearly do matter. Or, as I mentioned when discussing moral hazard, that financial\nregulation needs to do a better job of recognizing the role of incentives. For example,\ncompensation structures affect actions – as is evident in situations where short-term risk-taking is\nrewarded very lucratively and losses are not borne by the originators of the risk.\nThe current crisis provides the opportunity and impetus to reexamine a regulatory\nframework that originated in the Great Depression. While I believe there is a clear need to\nredesign the current regulatory structure, it is important that we not lose important features of the\ncurrent market. It is critical that any regulatory design not stifle the industry’s innovation and\ncreativity. However, the regulatory structure needs to be more adaptable to innovations – in\norder to ensure that new safety and soundness, and systemic, concerns are not ignored. And it\nneeds to be aware of the details of the evolving financial-market structure.\nAdditional regulations do run the risk of moral hazard where the presence of a safety net\ncreates an incentive to take additional risk. While any countercyclical monetary, fiscal, or\nregulatory policy runs this risk, it should be minimized. Ideally, situations requiring public\nsupport should occur only after losses have been borne by equity holders, and existing\nmanagement and directors have been held responsible for the losses.\nTo the extent a new regulatory structure reduces counterparty risk, or requires offsets in\ncapital for transactions involving significant counterparty risk, the likelihood of spillover effects\nfrom one firm’s failure should be significantly reduced. Ideally a new structure will reduce the\nlikelihood of future financial turmoil of the length and severity of current financial problems.\nThank you for having me join you today, and thank you for the opportunity to share my\nviews on principles to guide the redesign of U.S. financial regulation.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, December 8, 2008\n10 A.M. in Geneva / 4 A.M.

In such cases, intervention is necessary to protect the public interest.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nCitizens’ Housing and Planning Association (CHAPA)\n41st Annual Dinner and Meeting\nBoston Convention and Exhibition Center\n\nOctober 16, 2008\n\nI want to thank you for inviting me to join you this evening for the Citizens’\nHousing and Planning Association’s 41st Annual Dinner and Meeting. 1 And I want to\napplaud CHAPA for its longstanding, proactive commitment to affordable housing and\ncommunity development.\nI especially admire the ways in which you bring together and leverage the\ninterests of all parties with a stake in housing. This approach is no doubt challenging, but\nin it lie the roots of your success. As recent events in housing and financial markets have\nshown us, comprehensive solutions that engage many stakeholders can make for long\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\ndays, tough conversations, and complex negotiations – but can also make for workable\nsolutions that make a difference.\nLately I have had occasion to say that these are the times when you need a central\nbank. I would add tonight, in all sincerity, that these are times when you also need a\nCHAPA.\n\nAs you all know, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated recently,\nand while the housing and financial markets are most impacted, there is little doubt that\nthe effects are spilling over to the rest of the economy. However, now with appropriate\nand determined policy actions underway, I believe much of the spillover can be mitigated\nand the economy can return to growth that is closer to potential next year. To that end, I\nbelieve that policymakers should maintain a focus on three key areas, which I’ll mention\nbriefly.\n\nFirst, it is essential that liquidity for companies is maintained, or more\naccurately, is re-established. It is really in every citizen’s interest that firms –\nparticularly our most creditworthy ones – not face uncertainty over whether they will be\nable to continue to finance themselves with short-term debt. In fact, firms with top credit\nratings can be critical stabilizers during difficult times, as they should be in a position to\ncontinue to invest and ultimately help the economy maintain employment levels.\nIn this regard I am very pleased to point to recent steps policymakers have taken\nto restore well- functioning short-term credit markets. Actions taken include the\nestablishment by the Federal Reserve of liquidity facilities for money market funds,\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nprimary dealers, and issuers of commercial paper; the U.S. Treasury’s recent steps such\nas providing temporary insurance for money market funds and the plan to invest capital\nin banks to free up lending; and the FDIC’s guarantee on senior debt and non-interestbearing transaction accounts of banks. 2\nIn a speech at the University of Wisconsin last week, 3 I spoke in some detail\nabout issues of liquidity and liquidity-risk concerns. But as we gather tonight, I can say\nthat I believe appropriate and powerful actions are now in process, so that while it will\ntake some time for markets to return to normal, problems should moderate going forward.\n\nMy second observation is that financial firms need to have the financial strength\nto continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers. Making sure that banks have sufficient\ncapital to continue to lend is vital, because access to credit is critical for households and\nbusinesses.\nThe policy actions taken earlier this week, building on those of recent months,\nshould insure that banks have sufficient capital to continue lending, preventing more\nsignificant problems. It is very likely that these policy actions will mitigate some of the\nproblems that have been rippling out from capital-constrained banks.\n\nMy third broad observation for policy focus involves the housing market – it\nneeds to reach bottom and potential homebuyers need to gain the confidence to return to\nthe market. By this I mean that individuals shopping for homes need to be confident that\nappropriate financing is available for home-ownership. Individuals need to be more\nconfident in housing transactions proceeding normally because institutions and markets\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nwith a role in such transactions are functioning well. And individuals need to feel that\nthere is the potential for housing prices to rise.\nIt is this third broad theme, concerning the housing market, which I would like to\nexpand upon this evening. I plan to offer a few thoughts on the background to current\nhousing problems, make some observations on the issue of connecting lenders with\nborrowers, share some early results from a large foreclosure-prevention event we helped\norganize at Gillette Stadium, and end with a few concluding remarks.\n\nI. Background on Current Housing Problems 4\nI’m sure most of you at a CHAPA event would agree that the causes of current\nhousing problems are complicated and multifaceted. Yet despite the complexity of the\nissues, there are some observers who look for easy answers. Some have focused on\nlenders and lax underwriting standards; others have focused on profligate borrowers.\nHowever, neither of these simple “black and white” explanations seems consistent\nwith the facts – including the reality that just over half of all recent (2006-2007)\nforeclosures in Massachusetts have been suffered by prime, not subprime, borrowers –\nborrowers that did not need lax underwriting standards to qualify, and who did not have\nundue leverage since they qualified as prime borrowers. 5\nThis is a good example of the complexity and nuance that surrounds the situation.\nSo the explanations that assign blame in only one corner seem to me to fall short. This is\nan important point, because if we misdiagnose the causes of the crisis, we could misdirect\nthe remedies.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nIn this regard, allow me to make just a brief comment on a matter of some debate\nin recent news reports and opinion pieces. Some, unfortunately, see the crisis and say\nthat regulators pushed lenders to extend bad loans in previously underserved areas. The\nBoston Fed’s position has long been – despite some determined mischaracterizations –\nthat some flexibility in underwriting criteria may be appropriate if the borrower’s\nwillingness and ability to handle the debt can be affirmed, and such flexibility is\nconsidered in a consistent and fair manner across applicants.\nWe have not, and do not, advocate for irresponsible or poorly underwritten\nlending. That perspective, however, is not at odds with advocating that the various\nparticipants in housing markets continue to strive for fair access to credit, appropriately\nextended. Nor is it at odds with our belief that responsibly underwritten loans to\nborrowers in low- and moderate-income areas – including those whose credit situation is\nconsidered “subprime” but can document their ability to afford the loan – are welcome\nand indeed crucial.\n\nTo return to my discussion of the present situation, I know that most of you here\ntonight are seeing the toll that foreclosures are taking – particularly in low-and-moderateincome and minority communities and areas like Dorchester, Lawrence, Chelsea, and\nWorcester. Such communities are bearing the brunt of foreclosures in terms of volumes\nand rates.\nI would like to make a few observations on foreclosures in general. Foreclosures\nare cyclical, meaning they are much more likely to occur when the economy is in a\ndownturn and when housing prices are declining. Slide 2 shows the delinquency rates for\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nresidential mortgages at New England financial institutions. Not surprisingly, the last\ntime that housing prices were falling and the unemployment rate was rising significantly,\nwe saw a significant number of delinquencies.\nTo expand on this I would add that foreclosures, with their extraordinary toll on\nindividuals, neighborhoods, and the broader housing market and economy 6 – not to\nmention the lender or investor in many cases – usually have two common threads. First,\nforeclosure is much more likely if house prices are declining, since when prices are rising\n(especially if rapidly) a homeowner whose situation sours can sell the house rather than\nsee the house foreclosed. 7 Second, studies attribute the majority of foreclosures to certain\nunfavorable “life events” such as divorce, a spike in out-of-pocket healthcare costs\nstemming from an illness or injury in the family, or a loss of a job or income stream.\nSome such events are more likely during a period of elevated and rising unemployment\nrates. Unfortunately, in the current environment we have been experiencing both a\ndecline in home prices and rising unemployment rates – conditions where we might\nexpect elevated foreclosures.\nSlide 3 shows that areas with the most significant declines in home prices, such as\nFlorida, Nevada, and California, are also areas that have experienced very significant\nrates of foreclosure. This is also true for states in the Midwest that have been particularly\nimpacted by the downturn in the auto industry.\nClearly, matters have been aggravated by developments for borrowers and lenders\nin the marketplace for home loans. 8 For borrowers, it became much more common to\nborrow with little or no money down. Such borrowing is more risky, and would be\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nexpected to result in more foreclosures during an economic downturn. In addition, lowor no-documentation loans expanded.\nIt has also become increasingly easy to refinance homes or take out a home equity\n(“piggyback”) loan 9 . In fact, many (about 70 percent) of the subprime foreclosures in\nMassachusetts came on homes that were originally purchased with prime loans – for\nmany of these loans, owners had refinanced into subprime mortgages before defaulting. 10\nThis suggests room for improvement in terms of informing and educating borrowers on\nthe risks of homeownership, borrowing, and various financing arrangements. I would\nadd, somewhat parenthetically, that in some markets many of the homes in foreclosure\nare investor-owned, or are second homes. 11\nSignificant innovations in mortgage lending occurred as the industry evolved –\nand some of these innovations have exacerbated recent problems. Mortgages that used to\nbe held at local banks are now frequently originated by mortgage companies that reach\nout to borrowers through brokers, and then sell the mortgage to be part of a security\nbacked by many mortgages. 12\nWhile some mortgage companies and brokers clearly acted in good faith, under\nsuch “originate to distribute” arrangements there was less direct incentive to insure that\nthe mortgage was a sustainable product for the borrower than, for instance, with a loan a\nbank planned to hold in its portfolio. Certainly concerns about reputation in some cases\nexerted discipline – especially in situations where brokers depend heavily on word-ofmouth to generate leads – but there were significant countervailing forces at work.\nLenders were rewarded for volume, and brokers were frequently rewarded for both\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nvolume and higher interest rates. Too often in the unregulated sector, brokers’ customers\nended up in loans with high fees and unsustainable terms.\nMany mortgage brokers had little or no regulatory oversight. Most of the\nsubprime lenders active in this state were not federally regulated depository institutions,\nand most have failed. 13 In short, there is a role for increasing the incentives for lenders,\nand those that broker loans, to place homebuyers in mortgages that they can sustain.\n\nII. Connecting Distressed Borrowers with their Lenders\nIn today’s mortgage environment, the continuing relationship with the borrower –\nthat is, the collecting of mortgage payments and the handling of delinquencies and\nforeclosures – is generally handled by servicing organizations under contract to the\nindividuals or entities investing in the securities that are backed by the mortgages.\nSometimes the same organizations are both loan originators and servicers. It is important\nto recognize that in their servicer capacity these organizations are still working for the\ninvestors.\nA persistent complaint among distressed borrowers has been their inability to\nreach informed representatives of the loan servicers, to discuss and resolve their payment\nproblems. 14 In many accounts, borrowers report repeated efforts to reach servicers’\nrepresentatives and describe the frustration of “bouncing around” a telephone maze\nwithout being able to reach someone with the information and authority to discuss their\nsituation. Interestingly, we also hear complaints from loan servicers as to how difficult it\nis to reach and engage troubled borrowers. They highlight repeated mailings to troubled\nborrowers and the difficulty in finding phone numbers to reach some borrowers.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nWhen home mortgages were held by local community banks, the banks were\noften in a position to know the borrower personally, and were well aware of how to\ncontact the borrower should payment problems emerge. But today, loans may be\noriginated by a broker who has no involvement with the borrower once the loan has\nclosed. Frequently the loan servicer is located in another part of the country.\nIn sum, while economists like me have tended to assume that borrowers have a\nstrong incentive to discuss their payments problems and the possible options for\nrenegotiating terms, and that lenders have a strong incentive to avoid costly foreclosures,\nin practice getting borrowers and lenders together has proved to be surprisingly difficult\n(see Slide 4).\nIt was this observation that led the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to want to\nhold a large, well-publicized foreclosure-prevention workshop. There are significant\neconomies of scale to such an event. Large events can draw representatives of all the\nmajor servicers (many of whom have to fly in), so borrowers are less likely to be\ndisappointed by their servicer not attending. There are also economies of scale in\nadvertising the event and using a large venue with easy access and adequate parking and\npublic transportation arrangements. Large events are also advantageous for the loan\nservicer, because they can reach a large number of their troubled borrowers in a particular\ngeographic location.\nFortunately, Robert Kraft, Josh Kraft, and the New England Patriots Charitable\nFoundation were willing to provide Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots\nfootball team, as the site for a major foreclosure-prevention event in August (see Slide 5).\nWe had a variety of other invaluable co-sponsors and supporters: the Hope Now Alliance\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nhelped bring in the loan servicers, and Neighborworks America helped bring in the\nhousing counselors, some of whom work for organizations affiliated with CHAPA and\nsome of whom may be here tonight. Many of your organizations helped us get the word\nout about the event. I want to thank everyone for working with us.\nOutreach to borrowers was critical. The loan servicers that participated sent\n27,000 letters to their borrowers in New England who were 60 days or more past due.\nThe Boston Fed sent out over 50,000 postcards (Slide 6) to borrowers who took out\nsubprime loans – developing the mailing list from publicly available information from the\nRegistry of Deeds that was compiled by the Warren Group. We simply encouraged the\nrecipients to consider attending the event if they would find it helpful to speak directly to\ntheir servicer, and to meet with a foreclosure prevention counselor if they chose. For\nadditional outreach, with the help of our co-sponsors we placed numerous radio\ninterviews and ads in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. In part we focused on areas with\nhigh incidence of foreclosures.\nThe event itself needed a big venue (Slide 7). We hosted 20 servicer\norganizations, which sent 80 loss-mitigation representatives. Most of them remained\nbusy until late into the night, well after the formal close. In addition, we had the vital\nparticipation of some 20 counseling agencies that sent 50 counselors and legal aid\nrepresentatives. They also worked tirelessly and stayed well after the close. In addition\nthere was a large contingent of volunteers from Neighborworks, Fannie Mae, and the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston who pitched in to help the event run quite smoothly,\nconsidering its complexity and size.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nIII. Preliminary Results\nThe event attracted over 4,000 members of the public, representing 2,167\nborrowers. While there was a significant wait to see some servicers, 60 percent of the\nsurveyed attendees took advantage of the counseling services while waiting. Some\nservicers had the capacity to make loan modifications on the spot, while others could\nonly collect information, assess the borrower’s situation in person, and get back to the\nborrower after the event.\nIf one assumed that the mortgage crisis was isolated to one demographic slice of\nthe country, the scene that day told a very different story. The borrowers who made the\ntrek to Gillette seemed to be from all walks of life, and all races and ethnicities. The\nscene was both poignant and illuminating. Notably, the first lot to fill up at the beginning\nof our event was the handicapped parking area. We saw people of all ages with health\nconcerns and physical ailments.\nIt is still too early to statistically analyze the ultimate, long-term impact of the\nevent for distressed borrowers, but there are some indicative results that I can share with\nyou this evening. Slide 8 shows the results we at the Boston Fed have compiled to date\nfor borrowers that attended. We signed up just under 400 of the borrowers that attended\nto be contacted for phone interviews, which we began conducting in the week following\nthe event. The initial results show that about 39 percent of the people were still waiting\nto hear definitively from the servicer, about 37 percent had been told that the servicer\nwould not make any adjustments, and about 24 percent had received some modification\nin their loan terms.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nFurthermore, where there was a modification, the type of adjustments varied (see\nSlide 9). Of those we surveyed who had their loan modified, 62 percent had a permanent\nreduction in their interest rate, 42 percent had a temporary reduction in their payment,\nand 6 percent had a reduction in principal. In addition, about half of these borrowers\nwere offered a repayment plan to make up for the late payments. By the way, it is worth\nnoting that the event occurred in the middle of August, before the terms of the new\n“Hope for Homeowners” (H4H) program were announced by the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) on October 1.\nWe are now re-contacting the borrowers (the 39 percent) who were waiting to\nhear from their servicer about possible loan modifications, and we very much hope that\nround of calls will show additional progress. Of course, we also need more time to pass\nbefore we can analyze whether people who attended the event, or people who received\nloan modifications as a result, experience a significantly lower rate of foreclosure than\nthose who did not attend.\nWe learned a lot with this event. We hope that at future events, more servicers\nwill have the ability to make decisions on the spot or soon after the event. We are eager\nto see the numbers of borrowers who are still waiting to hear from their servicer on a\npossible modification go down, and for those decisions to happen more quickly in the\nfuture. Also, we will be interested to see whether the newly passed legislation has an\neffect on the number of borrowers that qualify for permanent reductions in interest rate or\nchanges in principal, relative to what was experienced in August.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M. Eastern Time or Upon Delivery\n\nConcluding Observations\nWhile it is too early for a full assessment of this one major foreclosure-prevention\nevent, we do know that 24 percent of the attendees we have surveyed already have had\nthe terms of their loan changed – and as we re-survey people, we hope that number will\ngo up. As servicers have become better staffed to work out problems with borrowers,\nand with new legislative initiatives and other policy developments, we hope that more\nconcrete actions can be taken sooner, thus avoiding preventable foreclosures.\nIt does appear that bringing borrowers together with servicers and counselors to\ndiscuss issues in person has significant advantages, and that large events reap certain\neconomies of scale. For these reasons the Boston Fed is looking to partner on one or\nmore large foreclosure-prevention events in the future. If we can line up a time and place\nthat are appropriate for another such event, we will be making an announcement.\nOf course, while foreclosure-prevention workshops appear to be helpful, ideally\nborrowers and lenders will not wait for these large events before initiating fruitful\ndiscussions. Ideally, with new legislative initiatives and the actions recently announced\nby the U.S. Treasury, more forceful actions will be taken by all participants –\nactions that in sum will help stabilize the housing market and benefit all its participants.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL October 16, 2008,\n7:50 P.M.

In Florida and Nevada, there were many investor-owned properties, and\nthese areas have been particularly impacted by foreclosures.\n12\n\nMortgages were pooled and securitized, then split and re-sold onto the secondary market to\ninvestors. Servicing companies act as intermediaries between the borrowers – the person making\nthe monthly mortgage payment, and the ultimate investor. The securities are governed by\ncomplex pooling and servicing agreements that vary in terms of what they allow. This makes\nloan workouts much more complicated. Some allow for flexibility on modifications according to\nstandard servicer procedure, others place caps on the number of loans that can be modified, others\nstill explicitly forbid modifications.\n13\n\nSee the Table in my speech on “Subprime Mortgage Problems: Research, Opportunities, and\nPolicy Considerations” – available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2007/120307.htm.\n14\n\nAn informed and balanced description of these issues was offered in the testimony of Urban\nEdge’s Mossik Hacobian before the House Committee on Financial Services on September 17.\nThe testimony, at a hearing on “The Implementation of the Hope for Homeowners Program and\nA Review of Foreclosure Mitigation Efforts”, is available at\nhttp://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/hacobian091708.pdf\n\n15\n\n\fObservations on Housing, Lending,\nand Foreclosure Prevention\nEric S.

            "content": "EMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n“Implications of a Credit Crunch”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire\nand the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce\n\nManchester, New Hampshire\nSeptember 3, 2008\n\nI am pleased to be with you today in New Hampshire, and would like to share\nsome perspectives on the implications of a credit crunch. 1 Unfortunately, a credit crunch\nis not an entirely new topic for those of you who have been doing business in New\nHampshire for some time, since you experienced the early 1990s – when many of the\nlarger banks in the state failed, and credit availability was an acute problem.\nToday, banking and real estate problems are less severe in New England than they\nare in many other parts of the country. However, on a national scale the “headwinds”\npushing against the economy look to be a good bit stronger than those experienced in the\nearly 1990s.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nOver the course of this summer it became clear that the economic headwinds have\nnot subsided as hoped. With some help from tax rebates and previous interest-rate cuts,\nthe second quarter was better than many had feared; however, most private forecasters\nare expecting significantly slowed growth in the second half of this year – as residential\ninvestment continues to be a drag on the economy, as consumers tighten up on their\nspending, as the impact of the Federal tax rebate subsides, and as weakness among some\nof our major trading partners makes the outlook for many exports more restrained.\nWith the economy expected to expand at a rate below its potential in the second\nhalf of this year, further increases in the unemployment rate are possible. It now appears\nthat the national unemployment rate may rise above 6 percent, an increase of more than\none and a quarter percentage points – or about 2 million workers – from last August,\nwhen the financial problems emerged.\nContributing to this weakness, in my view, is a significant change in the nature of\nthe financial problems facing the economy. In particular, the financial problems that\ninitially created a liquidity crunch 2 have now evolved into a more traditional credit\ncrunch.\nBefore discussing a credit crunch, allow me to describe what I mean by a liquidity\ncrunch. Simply put, the reluctance of banks to lend to each other became quite elevated,\nbeginning in July 2007. A combination of balance sheet constraints, poor transparency\nregarding potential losses, and concerns about heightened counterparty risk contributed to\nless liquid financial markets. Uncertainty over asset valuations increased, and banks\nbecame reluctant to take on counterparty risk with certain financial institutions –\nparticularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nTurning to the notion of a credit crunch, we see that mounting losses at financial\ninstitutions, and an increasing reluctance among investors to invest new capital while the\neconomic outlook is unclear, are forcing financial institutions to “shrink their balance\nsheets.”\nAllow me to explain that notion for the non-bankers here today. Recall that a loan\nis counted as an asset on a bank’s balance sheet. Banks hold capital in part as a reserve\nagainst the possibility that a loan will default. Thus banks attempt to maintain a\nreasonable ratio of capital to assets. If a bank experiences a reduction in the value of its\ncapital or an increase in its assets (for example as credit lines that were extended in better\ntimes are tapped), 3 the bank must take steps to shrink the asset side of its balance sheet in\norder to restore its desired capital-to-asset ratio.\nIn other words, the bank becomes more restrictive in its lending. This shrinkage\nin lending entails tighter underwriting standards, wider interest rate margins, and reduced\ncredit availability.\nAn alternative is to raise more capital, but this can be quite difficult in times like\nthese, when investors are wary of putting more money into some seemingly fragile\nfinancial institutions. Witness the reliance, particularly by some large, well-known\ninstitutions, on foreign sources of capital like the sovereign wealth funds in recent\nmonths.\nThis seemingly technical issue of banks’ balance sheets is no small matter for the\nbroader economy. Because a bank extends loans that are many times the value of its\ncapital base – the hallmark of a “leveraged” institution – the result is that when a bank’s\ncapital loses value, it must reduce its loans by much more in order to maintain its capital-\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nasset ratio. In numeric terms, for a bank seeking to maintain a 10 percent capital-to-asset\nratio, the bank would need to reduce assets – like loans – by $10 for every $1 lost in\ncapital. 4\nToday I am going to discuss the implications of a credit crunch – specifically, the\neffects of a credit crunch on the degree of stimulus that is provided by monetary policy.\nIn particular, I will discuss how a low Federal Funds rate provides much less stimulus\nduring a credit crunch than it otherwise would – because those low rates for inter-bank\nloans do not necessarily translate into lower costs to the vast majority of borrowers who\nrely on funding sources outside the Federal Funds market.\nTo preview the punch line, let me say that looking only at the Federal Funds rate\nduring periods of significant economic headwinds will, in my view, provide a misleading\ngauge of the degree of monetary stimulus that the Federal Reserve has put in place. At\nsuch times, a low Federal Funds rate does not signal a particularly accommodative\nmonetary policy, but rather offsets some of the contraction that would otherwise occur as\nfinancial institutions tighten credit standards and offer borrowing rates with a spread over\nthe Federal Funds rate that is larger than usual (in other words, larger than would be the\ncase outside of credit crunch conditions).\nThat said, make no mistake: in my view, credit conditions would likely be much\nworse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds rate and taken several\ninnovative steps to enhance liquidity in the marketplace – steps like opening our new\nTerm Auction Facility and other facilities that complement our traditional “Discount\nWindow” for banks.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nI. Overview of recent financial issues\nFor context I would like to provide an overview, as I see it, of the recent financial\nturmoil. Over a year ago, problems stemming from large losses in securities backed by\nsubprime 5 loans led to a liquidity crunch. While the initial trigger for the financial\nturbulence was related to subprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of\ncomplicated financial instruments caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and\nmarkets that depend on securitization – including state and municipal financing, student\nloans, and commercial real estate. Inter-bank lending markets, mortgage markets tied to\nsecuritization, and short-term assets financed through the commercial paper market\nexperienced sharply wider spreads and significant declines in volumes.\nAt the time, it was hoped that these problems would be short-lived. However,\nafter one year, while the spreads have fluctuated they remain quite elevated by historical\nstandards.\nThe initial liquidity problems soon created credit problems at large financial\ninstitutions with significant exposure to these markets. While it is true that significant\nnew capital has been raised, for many institutions the new capital only partially offset\nlosses and provided little cushion for potential additional losses.\nIn addition, the continued decline in housing prices has caused problems to extend\nwell beyond the larger banks active in complicated financial arrangements. Falling\nhousing prices, coupled with a rising unemployment rate, are contributing to increases in\nnon-performing loans – on prime as well as subprime mortgages, on construction loans,\nand on home equity loans (see Figure 1).\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs problems have extended to a broader set of financial institutions, concerns that\nthe financial condition of leveraged institutions will create a more traditional credit\ncrunch have increased. The last time a significant credit crunch occurred in the United\nStates was in the early 1990s.\nAt that time, falling commercial real estate prices in New England, the MidAtlantic, and California caused large losses of capital for banks in those regions. Many\nbanks had little success in attracting new capital, and instead shrank their assets to\nimprove their capital ratios. 6 Because of the implication of leverage that I mentioned\nearlier, banks’ capital losses can have a magnified impact on the overall economy.\nIt had been hoped by many observers that consolidation in the banking industry\nand growth in securitization would make a 1990s-style credit crunch less likely.\nUnfortunately, that is not how things have worked out.\nAs we all know, there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry\n(see Figure 2). It was hoped that banks with a more national footprint would be less\nsusceptible to regional shocks and thus more able to lend during regional downturns.\nUnfortunately, many of the largest commercial and investment banks had a significant\nconcentration of their assets in complex securities that have declined in value, had\nsignificant exposures to subprime mortgages or so-called “Alt A” mortgages that have\ndeclined in value, and also had exposure to construction and residential loans that have\nsuffered from national rather than just regional declines in value.\nIn terms of securitization, the loss of confidence in complex financial instruments\nand their ratings has dried up the demand for all but the simplest and least-risky\nsecuritizations. So rather than serving as a shock absorber for banking problems, it seems\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthat securitization has actually exacerbated the problem. Indeed, a wide variety of loans\nthat were once widely securitized are now not available (e.g., subprime mortgages) or are\nonly available from financial institutions at much higher costs (e.g., jumbo loans).\n\nII. Credit availability for businesses\nNow with that context, I’d like to comment on the current state of credit\navailability for businesses.\nThe 1990s credit crunch was primarily a problem for small and medium-sized\nbusinesses that were dependent on their bank for credit – businesses that found credit less\navailable as their bank reduced assets to improve its capital ratio. As I suggested earlier,\nbanks can choose to shrink assets in several ways – by raising rates, tightening credit\nstandards, or refusing to roll over loans and lines of credit that expire.\nA useful indicator of bank lending practices has been the Federal Reserve’s senior\nloan officer survey, which asks senior loan officers from large domestic banks as well as\nforeign banks with branches in the United States a series of questions. Numerous\nacademic studies have found that the survey can be useful in estimating credit restraint\nand its impact on bank-sensitive components of GDP. 7\nFigure 3 provides the responses of loan officers asked if their bank had tightened\nlending standards for commercial and industrial loans to firms over the past three months.\nAs the figure shows, the results of the July 2008 survey indicated that nearly 60 percent\nof banks had tightened their lending standards for large firms and 65 percent had\ntightened their lending standards for small firms. This was the largest percentage of\nbanks tightening commercial and industrial loan standards for small firms in the survey’s\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nhistory, which includes both the 2001 and 1990 recessions (and the number for large\nfirms is right in the vicinity of the observations from those eras).\nFigure 4 shows the survey answers to the question of whether lenders had\nincreased spreads – in other words the amount by which their loan rates exceed the\nbank’s cost of funds. In July, about 80 percent of domestic banks said that they had\nincreased their loan rates for large firms relative to their cost of funds, and roughly 70\npercent of banks said they had increased their loan rates for small firms relative to their\ncost of funds. These responses represent the highest net percentage of banks reporting\nthat they had increased interest-rate spreads on commercial and industrial loans in the\nsurvey’s history.\nFigure 5 relates to the survey’s question on whether domestic respondents had\ntightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans. Again, the results of the\nJuly survey are at high points for the series, exceeding the peak that occurred during the\nearly 1990s.\nIn sum, these results indicate that the financial problems at banks are beginning to\nbe reflected in reduced lending to businesses. The tightening already appears to be more\nwidespread than it was during the early 1990s (the “economic headwinds” period), and\nportends more difficulty in financing business fixed investment and commercial real\nestate projects in the second half of this year.\nAt least for large firms, an alternative to bank financing is to go directly to the\nbond market to raise funds. Figure 6 shows the Moody’s “Aaa” grade bond yields and\nthe effective Federal Funds rate over the past 20 years. High-grade bond yields tend to\nfall during periods where the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy and the economy\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nis experiencing a significant slowdown. However, to date – despite a significant\nreduction in the Federal Funds rate target from 5.25 to 2 percent – the corporate bond\nyield has remained little changed from its level just before the financial problems first\nemerged in August 2007.\nThus, while the Federal Reserve has lowered the Federal Funds rate, interest rates\npaid by businesses have not reflected this easing. Banks have increased their spreads on\nbusiness lending and investors have continued to demand relatively high yields on bonds\nissued by highly credit-worthy borrowers.\n\nIII. Consumer credit conditions\nSimilarly, consumer credit practices have also undergone significant changes of\nlate, as banks have underwritten consumer mortgages and credit card loans, but have\nincreasingly sold many of those loans in the secondary market. With an active secondary\nmarket provided by the securitization of these loans, it was again widely anticipated that\nthe availability of these types of credit would be relatively protected from credit supply\nshocks.\nThat, however, has not been the case since last August. Innovations that were\nsupposed to insulate consumers from credit supply problems have essentially done the\nopposite, making a credit crunch a concern for consumers as well as businesses.\nInitially, borrowers of subprime mortgages felt the largest impact. Because\ninvestors lost confidence in the securitization structure for subprime mortgages, investors\nvirtually abandoned the market, impeding the ability of borrowers to get subprime\nmortgages.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nBut so-called jumbo mortgages were also affected. While these mortgages were\noften to borrowers with good credit history, banks were no longer able to securitize these\nmortgages but were forced to hold the loans in their own portfolio. This resulted in the\nspread on jumbos rising, reflecting banks’ limited desire to expand their balance sheet on\nthese types of mortgages.\nInitially, the one area of the mortgage market that was only modestly impacted\nwas that for prime mortgages that could be securitized by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nHowever, this spring highlighted the financial problems at the two Government\nSponsored Enterprises (the GSEs) – problems which have both increased their borrowing\ncosts and reduced their willingness to expand their balance sheets.\nFigure 7 provides the 30-year conventional mortgage rate and the effective\nFederal Funds rate. During the previous two periods of significant monetary easing,\naround the times of the 1990 and 2001 recessions, the 30-year rate trended down when\nthe Federal Reserve was reducing the Federal Funds rate. This is in contrast to the\ncurrent period when, despite a significant decline in the Federal Funds rate, the 30-year\nconventional mortgage rate has remained little changed.\nFigure 8 shows the rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and\njumbo mortgages. Because one-year ARMs are frequently reset, their rates tend to be\nmuch more responsive to Federal Reserve rate easing than those of longer-term loans.\nWhile the yield on one-year ARMs did fall significantly in the previous two periods\nwhere the Federal Funds rate declined substantially, this time the yield on one-year\nARMs has been fairly unresponsive to the lower Federal Funds rate. While there is only\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\na limited time-series for rates on jumbo mortgages, those rates have increased\nsignificantly despite the lower Federal Funds rate.\nIn sum, the problems relating to the securitization market and the GSEs have\nreduced the responsiveness of mortgage and other consumer lending rates to reductions in\nthe Federal Funds rate. It is also a sign of the times that for many borrowers, access to\ncredit may be limited because of an unwillingness to lend to borrowers with troubled\ncredit histories, or because falling housing prices have reduced their ability to utilize\nhome equity lines of credit. Where credit is available, the yields have remained high\ndespite the reductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nThat is not to say that monetary policy has been ineffective – quite the opposite,\nin my view. The rate easing and liquidity measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve\nwere appropriate and effective, in that credit problems would likely be a great deal more\nsevere, and widespread, had we not taken the steps.\n\nIV. Implications for monetary policy\nNow a few additional thoughts on what this all means for U.S. monetary policy.\nWhile the Federal Funds rate is low by historical standards, I would argue that\none cannot capture the stance of monetary policy by only looking at this one rate,\nparticularly during a period when the transmission of monetary policy has been impeded\nby problems with securitization, financial institutions, and GSEs.\nDuring a credit crunch, various constraints on the supply of credit will make\nmarket rates less responsive to a lower Federal Funds rate. While the Federal Reserve\nessentially sets the Federal Funds rate (the rate at which banks will lend to each other), it\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndoes so with the intention of also impacting other rates that more directly affect\nborrowers. But in the current period, many business borrowers and consumers are\nfinding their access to credit has diminished, and their cost of credit has risen, despite the\nreductions in the Federal Funds rate.\nIndeed, as suggested earlier, the reductions in the Federal Funds rate have done\nlittle but offset some of the tightening occurring in the marketplace in response to the\ncredit crunch conditions. Thus one can argue that much of the easing in monetary policy\nto date has merely offset the tightening in credit conditions created by the financial\nturmoil that began last summer.\nIdeally, as these financial headwinds subside, the current very large spreads\nrelative to the Federal Funds rate will narrow, and we will see the rates available to\nbusinesses and consumers decline, helping to stimulate demand. It is precisely for this\nreason that the Federal Reserve has undertaken a variety of innovative liquidity measures,\nto enable the financial markets to begin to operate more normally.\nLet me conclude by reiterating my view that credit conditions, while difficult,\nwould likely be much worse if the Federal Reserve had not lowered the Federal Funds\nrate and opened the additional liquidity facilities.\nIn closing let me thank you again for inviting me to speak with you today about\nthese important issues, and their implications – for all of us in the region and for the\nnational economy.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, September 3, 2008\n12:30 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n2\n\nFor more on this topic see my comments on liquidity and systemic risk, delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond's 2008 Credit Markets Symposium (“The Changing Business\nof Banking”) in Charlotte, North Carolina on April 18, 2008 (available at\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/041808.htm).\n\n3\n\nOver the past year bank assets have actually grown, particularly at the largest institutions.\nMuch of this growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in\nresponse to liquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the\nfactors that have increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial\npaper, firms expanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were\noriginated with the expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing\nthe purchase of municipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being\nsecuritized. Swelling bank assets place pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull back in other\nareas.\n4\n\nFor a description of how leveraged institutions’ losses can have a disproportionate impact\nsee Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin. They have highlighted the importance of loss of\ncapital on highly leveraged broker-dealers (“Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the Mortgage\nMarket Meltdown” – U.S. Monetary Policy Forum Report No. 2; Rosenberg Institute, Brandeis\nInternational Business School and Initiative on Global Markets, University of Chicago Graduate\nSchool of Business (2008).\nSee also Adrian and Shin, “Financial Intermediaries, Financial Stability and Monetary\nPolicy” (paper prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Symposium at Jackson\nHole, August 2008).\n5\n\nIn essence “subprime” loans refer to mortgages that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. Subprime loans carry higher interest\nrates reflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in\nsubprime loans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime\nloans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking\nsubsidiaries.\n\n6\n\nFor a description of credit crunch problems in the early 1990s see Peek and Rosengren,\n\n“The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of Money, Credit and\n\nBanking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638.\n7\n\nSee for example Cara Lown and Don Morgan, “The Credit Cycle and the Business Cycle:\nNew Findings Using the Loan Officer Opinion Survey” in Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking\n38 (2006), pp. 1575-1597, for how the loan officer survey may be help predict trends in GDP\ncomponents that are bank dependent.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 53rd Economic Conference\nUnderstanding Inflation and the Implications for Monetary Policy:\nA Phillips Curve Retrospective\n\nChatham, Massachusetts\nJune 10, 2008\n\nI am very pleased to open the second day of this conference focused on the 50th\nanniversary of the Phillips Curve. 1 This conference, although long in the planning, turns\nout to be very timely. The effects of significant increases in food and energy prices are\nstill feeding through the economy, as are the impacts of appropriately aggressive\nmonetary and fiscal policy responses to the recent financial turmoil and its spillover\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\neffects. As a result of all these developments, consumers, commentators, and\npolicymakers are intensely interested in the current outlook for inflation.\nFood- and gas-price increases – so-called supply shocks – have heightened\neveryone’s awareness that the total consumer price index (CPI) has increased 3.9 percent\nover the past year; clearly an undesirable outcome. As consumers, we all buy food and\ngas with high frequency, so sharp relative price movements for these goods get our\nimmediate attention. Furthermore, if sustained, such increases in food and energy prices,\nwhich are not currently suggested by food and energy futures prices, would raise concern\nthat these commodity price increases could become embedded in expectations – clearly\nan outcome to be avoided.\nDespite these recent supply shocks, the central tendency of the forecasts of the\nFederal Reserve Presidents and Governors indicates that total personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation and core PCE inflation are expected to move downward, to\naround or below 2 percent over the next two years (Table 1). While many private\nforecasts do not yet extend out through 2010, many that do are broadly consistent with\nthe central tendency reported after the April Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting.\nThese baseline forecasts indicate a general expectation among many analysts,\nforecasters, and policymakers that inflationary pressures will moderate. However, there\nremain significant disagreements over which factors are the most important determinants\nof future inflation. It is my hope that this conference will help facilitate – and indeed\nsharpen – the debate and provide some empirical support for our thinking on the inflation\noutlook and the implications for monetary policy.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday in these opening remarks I simply want to highlight and briefly mention\nsome of the key empirical questions that I expect will be addressed in greater depth in the\nconference presentations and discussions.\n\n The first empirical question involves the role that domestic excess capacity (for\nexample, unemployed workers) plays in reducing inflation. Does sizable\nexcess capacity in the economy significantly reduce future inflation? This\nquestion is at the heart of discussions of the Phillips Curve and its relevance\nfor forecasting inflation.\n\n The second question involves the divergence between core inflation and total\ninflation. Many forecasters – including many central bankers – use the core\ninflation rate as an indicator of future total inflation trends. Is that use of core\ninflation prudent? How will these two measures, core inflation and total\ninflation, converge over time? A closely-related question centers on higher\nfood and energy prices: how important is the “pass-through” of these price\nchanges to the core and overall inflation rates?\n\n And the third question involves the impact of relative price changes on labor\nmarkets. Specifically, under what circumstances do inflationary pressures\naffect inflation expectations, and become embedded in wage and salary\nincreases? In the current environment, we need to gauge the likelihood that\ninflationary pressures will cause further upward pressures on wages and\nsalaries.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nI.\n\nExcess Capacity and Inflation\nA key element of the Phillips Curve framework is the assumption that significant\n\nexcess capacity in the economy should exert downward pressure on inflation. While this\nkey link in the Phillips framework provokes considerable skepticism in some quarters, it\nnonetheless serves as the underpinning of the inflation forecast for many private\nforecasters, much of Wall Street, and indeed many of the models utilized within the\nFederal Reserve System. 2\nThis widespread use reflects the fact that forecasts of inflation do seem to\nimprove when measures of excess capacity are incorporated. 3 These models derive their\nsuccess from the simple empirical observation that during recessionary periods, the\ninflation rate tends to fall (Figure 1). Over the past 50 years, the rate of total CPI\ninflation has tended to be lower after a recession than before; and the proxies for excess\ncapacity capture this business cycle regularity. The intuition behind this empirical\nregularity is that, with widespread current and expected excess capacity, firms have\ngreater difficulty increasing prices, workers’ expectations of inflation decline, and they\nthus demand smaller wage increases. As a result, during a recession wage and price\ninflation slow, and the economy returns to full employment with a lower equilibrium\ninflation rate.\nDespite the heavy reliance on a Phillips Curve empirical framework in many\nmodels, the extent and reliability of the short-run tradeoff between excess capacity and\nthe inflation rate remain matters of much debate. In addition, how inflation expectations\nare set remains an issue that economists are only beginning to understand, and an area of\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nconsiderable disagreement. As both questions are very important for policy, I look\nforward to a thorough discussion of these issues over the next two days.\n\nII.\n\nIssues around Core and Total Inflation Rates, and their Divergence\nIn the long run, in my view, it is total inflation – rather than core inflation, which\n\nexcludes the volatile food and energy components – that should be the focus of monetary\npolicy. 4 However, total inflation is typically much more strongly influenced by\ntemporary changes in relative prices than core inflation. This suggests a potential role for\ncore inflation as an indicator of the subsequent trajectory of total inflation – so I want to\nspend a few minutes focusing on the impact of relative price changes on inflation, and on\nthe relationship between core and total inflation measures.\nAs shown in Figure 2, total CPI has been more volatile than core CPI, as food and\nenergy prices have been much less stable than many of the other components of inflation.\nBecause the volatility in food and energy components is largely transitory, many focus on\nthe core rate of inflation as a “medium-term” indicator of where inflation is trending.\nIn gauging the usefulness of core inflation as an indicator of inflation’s trend, one\nmight perform the following simple exercise: see whether, when total inflation and core\ninflation show significant divergence, the core inflation rate moves to the total inflation\nrate over time, or the total inflation rate moves to the core? 5\nOne would expect the core to move to the total if aggregate inflation expectations\nconsistently reflect a large part of the volatile changes in food and energy prices that arise\nfrom periodic supply shocks. If, instead, such supply shocks are seen as producing a\ntemporary change in relative prices – and as a result are not incorporated into inflationary\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nexpectations – then one would expect total inflation to converge to the underlying rate of\ncore inflation.\nThis is more than just an academic debate. Over the last four years, rising food\nand energy prices have caused total inflation to be significantly higher than core inflation.\nFigure 3 plots, over ten years, the gap between total inflation and core inflation against\nthe total inflation rate two years ahead. The relationship between the two shows that, at\nleast in this period, when total inflation is higher than core inflation, total inflation tends\nto move down to close the gap. 6\nFigure 4 plots the same gap between total inflation and core inflation against the\ncore rate of inflation two years ahead. In this case there is no relationship, indicating that\nat least in this period core inflation does not rise following an increase in the spread\nbetween total and core inflation. 7, 8\nGiven that total inflation has been higher than core inflation for the last several\nyears, will core inflation tend to rise to close the gap, or will the total inflation rate fall to\nclose the gap? Work under way in the Boston Fed’s research department, forthcoming in\na discussion paper, would seem to indicate the latter; however, we urge participants at\nthis conference to share their views and help improve understanding of this important\ntopic.\nOf course, closely related to the question of how core and total inflation converge\nis the issue of how large movements in food and energy prices might differentially affect\ncore versus total inflation – the so-called “pass-through” of food and energy prices into\ninflation. 9 The observation that, of late, total inflation tends to converge to core inflation\nwould seem to imply that higher food and energy prices have a significant concurrent\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nimpact on the total inflation rate, but have little contemporaneous effect on core inflation,\nand little or no lasting effect on either. Food and energy prices, this observation implies,\nare likely to have little impact on longer-run expectations of inflation.\nHowever, some have raised concerns that the future behavior of inflation may\nlook different than the past, perhaps because food and energy price increases will no\nlonger be transitory, but will instead become an enduring feature of the economic\nlandscape. Rising food and energy prices could become the norm if demand for these\ncommodities outstrips supply on a continuous or prolonged basis.\nIt is important to note, however, that futures prices do not generally reflect an\nexpectation that oil prices will continue rising at their recent rapid rate. In the past,\nhigher oil prices have spurred conservation efforts and contributed to slower economic\ngrowth – both reducing energy demand. Higher oil prices also encouraged new\ntechnological improvements, and exploration and production from higher-cost sources –\nincreasing supply. In other words, economists expect that the laws of supply and demand\nwill ultimately limit price increases – even in the face of relatively rapid economic\ngrowth in emerging markets. That said, it seems to be taking quite a long time to date for\nlong-run supply and demand influences to rein in oil price increases. You might say the\nshort run is getting longer every day.\nAnother frequent explanation for recent oil prices increases is that dollar\ndepreciation has boosted the demand for oil in strong-currency countries while\ndiscouraging oil output in the oil-producing countries. However, the strength of the\nstatistical correlation between the exchange rate and oil prices is modest at best. As\nFigure 5 shows, while the price of oil is indeed correlated with the exchange rate, the\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncumulative change in the exchange rate pales in comparison to the enormous run-up in oil\nprices – in other words, the exchange rate cannot explain more than a very small fraction\nof the change in the dollar price of oil.\nFinally, even if oil prices do continue to rise much faster than U.S. core inflation\nfor an extended period, the experience of the past 20 years (shown in Figure 6) indicates\nthat there is a relatively low correlation between oil price movements and the underlying\ncore rate of inflation. 10 More comprehensive statistical work by researchers at the\nBoston Reserve Bank concludes that the impact of relative price shocks from oil – and\nother related supply shocks – has had a very minor impact on the underlying rate of\ninflation. 11 Of course, we know that not everyone here shares that view, and we look\nforward to hearing other perspectives on this issue over the course of the next two days.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Impact on Labor Markets\nA question related to substantial supply shocks is whether labor contracts will\n\nstart to incorporate higher wage demands intended to offset rising price pressures. If\nworkers believe that underlying inflation will be higher over time as a result of increases\nin food and energy prices, they may begin demanding higher wages and salaries to match\ntheir expectations of future inflation.\nThe determinants of worker expectations remain a relative unknown in\neconomics. We know that a wide variety of factors can affect expectations, factors\nranging from past rates of inflation to sophisticated forecasts of future inflation which\nend up being consistent with economists’ models. The role that the Federal Reserve may\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nplay in the formation of those expectations has been an issue of discussion and debate for\neconomists since the late 1970s; it continues to be so.\nIn any event, workers’ ability to demand higher wages and salaries is likely to\ndepend on the competitiveness and structure of labor markets, as well as on broader\neconomic conditions. Recent increases in U.S. wages and salaries have been quite\nmodest and do not show evidence of “ratcheting up” related to recent supply shocks (see\nFigure 7).\nLike the inflation rate, increases in wages and salaries have, historically, slowed\nduring recessions. Since wages and salaries are an important component of overall costs,\none can argue that the excess capacity that exists during recessions is an important\nelement in dampening wage and salary demands – and as a result plays the role in the\ninflation framework that is embedded in the Phillips Curve.\nWork done in the Research Department at the Boston Fed indicates that recent\nwage and salary growth has not reflected increased inflationary expectations or a\nsignificant reaction to recent supply shocks. Because these conclusions have important\npolicy implications, we hope the conference will include a vigorous discussion of the\nevidence on this issue.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn short introductory remarks like these, it is impossible to do justice to the topic\nof understanding inflation dynamics and how they might impact monetary policy. That is\nexactly why we were eager to seize the opportunity presented by the Phillips Curve\nanniversary and organize a conference devoted to the topic. Fortunately, those who are\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\npresenting and discussing papers have the opportunity to delve into the issues in much\nmore depth than I have been able to, today.\nAs I believe this conference will show, the past 50 years have brought significant\nadvances in our understanding of these issues. Building from the relatively primitive\nrelationship embodied in the Phillips Curve, economic researchers are now in the process\nof developing a much more robust understanding of inflation dynamics.\nAnd in my view, one area that provides particularly promising opportunities for\nfurther research is inflation expectations. Early Phillips-Curve models used simple rules\nof thumb to capture how inflation expectations are set. But increasingly, economists are\nstarting to develop a more rigorous understanding of how inflation expectations are\nestablished. I anticipate that the burgeoning field of behavioral economics will greatly\nimprove our understanding of how individuals set their expectations and how consumers,\nfirms, and workers react to supply shocks and other macroeconomic issues. The Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston’s Research Center for Behavioral Economics and\nDecisionmaking 12 is devoting a good deal of attention to these issues.\nAlthough many economists have done extensive work on inflation dynamics, I\nstrongly suspect that this conference will highlight that there is still plenty of work to be\ndone. And like all of you here, I look forward to hearing about some of the new research\nthat is currently under way. My hope for this conference is that each of us will gain a\nnumber of insights that will allow us to better understand our interesting and at times\nchallenging macroeconomic environment – and that will help those of us who are\npolicymakers to better serve the public’s interests. So I wish you a very engaging two\ndays.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nNotes\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). These\ncomments have benefited from extensive discussions with members of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston’s research department, in particular with economists Jeff Fuhrer, Geoffrey Tootell,\nJane Little and Giovanni Olivei.\n\n2\n\nSee for example the following articles which discuss the robustness of the Phillips Curve.\nFuhrer, Jeff C. “The Phillips Curve is Alive and Well” New England Economic Review\n(March/April 1995 – http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer1995/neer295c.htm) and Barnes,\nMichelle L. and Giovanni Olivei, “Inside and Outside Bounds: Threshhold Estimates of the\nPhillips Curve,” New England Economic Review (2003 –\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2003/neer03a.pdf)\n\n3\n\nOf course, the models may differ in their measures of excess capacity. Some measure\nexcess capacity as the difference between the unemployment rate and the estimated NonAccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). Others may use the “GDP gap” – the\ndifference between the actual and potential output of goods and services in an economy. Others\nuse a cost-based measure of excess capacity, typified by the “New Keynesian Phillips Curves”\nthat rely on a measure of the inflation-adjusted marginal cost of output.\n4\n\nOf course, some observers disagree that we should target total, not core, inflation,\narguing that a central bank should target things it can control (domestic prices) not those it\ncannot.\n5\n\nJeff Fuhrer, and Geoff Tootell have done more extensive work examining the statistical\nrelationship between core and total inflation, to be forthcoming.\n\n6\n\nFigure 3: R2 = 0.3961; y = -1.0143x + 0.7406\n(-4.5095) (2.2481) t-statistics in parenthesis\n\n7\n\nFigure 4: R2 = 0.0926; y = 0.1817x - 0.0039\n(1.7791) (-0.0261)\n\nt-statistics in parenthesis\n\n8\n\nNotably, if we plot these relationships for an earlier time period, 1970-1990, the results\nare very different. When total inflation diverged from core inflation, total inflation did not move\ndown to close the gap.\n9\n\nOf course, food and energy prices are just a subset of the factors outside the gap or\nPhillips Curve framework that could periodically affect core inflation. Other factors that could\nshift the Phillips Curve from time to time include other commodity prices, import prices and the\nexchange rate.\n\n10\n\nThe weakness in the relationship between changes in oil prices and the underlying\ninflation rate is highlighted by the fact that over a thirty-year period the correlation is low and\npositive whereas over a twenty- or ten-year period the correlation is low and negative.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Tuesday, June 10, 2008\n8:00 A.M.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nThe New England Economic Partnership’s\nSpring Economic Outlook Conference\non Credit, Housing, and the Consequences for New England\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 30, 2008\n\nAs someone who is an ardent consumer of good economic analysis, I have often\nbeen the beneficiary of work done by the New England Economic Partnership. So it is\ncertainly a pleasure to be with you today to participate in your discussion of current\ntrends in the economy, and credit and housing matters. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nOver the past year, the economy has been buffeted by a series of shocks including\nfinancial turmoil; an emergency acquisition of a major investment bank to avoid a\nsudden, disorderly failure 2 ; falling national housing prices; and oil prices that have\nexceeded $130 a barrel. Despite all these challenges, the U.S. unemployment rate is at 5\npercent; the rise in prices of “core” consumer goods and services (Personal Consumption\nExpenditures) to a little above 2 percent, while unwelcome, has not been large compared\nwith past episodes; and the economy has been growing, albeit at a much slower pace then\nwe would prefer. These relatively benign outcomes to date are at least partly the result of\nrecent monetary and fiscal policy actions taken to mitigate some of the problems facing\nthe economy.\nIn keeping with the title of your conference – “Crunched: Credit, Housing and the\nConsequences for New England” – I am going to focus on the continued downside risk\nposed by falling asset prices, particularly in the housing sector. Residential investment\n(the housing component of GDP 3 ) has declined for nine straight quarters, and in all\nlikelihood will decline this quarter as well. This has been an unusually long period of\ncontinuous decline in the housing sector, and coupled with falling housing prices\nnationally, has complicated predictions of what will happen in the economy going\nforward.\nI would like to begin by first looking at some of the macroeconomic issues related\nto the housing sector, and considering why – despite being a relatively small component\nof GDP – housing continues to be a source of such significant uncertainty in the\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThen secondly, I will discuss some of the varied and interesting research done\nrecently at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston by economists and analysts (including\nPrabal Chakrabarti, Chris Foote, Kristopher Gerardi, Lorenz Goette, Kai-Yan Lee, Adam\nShapiro, and Paul Willen). This work highlights some striking differences, and some\nsimilarities, between the current housing problems and those experienced in New\nEngland in the early 1990s. In particular I will note the observation that foreclosures\nremained elevated well after their peak in the last downturn, and the finding that multifamily properties are playing a much more important role in the current housing\ndownturn.\nThirdly, I am going to discuss why developing solutions to the current housing\nproblems has not been easy, and why the housing sector, despite being sensitive to\ninterest rates, remains very weak notwithstanding a significant amount of monetary\nstimulus in the form of Federal Funds rate reductions. In particular, I will highlight the\nimportant role of so-called “piggyback loans,” or second mortgages; the implications of\nhomeowners having “negative home equity” as a result of falling house prices; and the\ncomplications created by the securitization of many mortgages.\nFinally, I am going to briefly discuss some implications for policymakers in\nseeking to develop and implement responses to the problems posed by falling house\nprices and rising delinquencies and foreclosures.\n\nI.\n\nMacroeconomic Implications of Housing Trends\nFigure 1 highlights how precipitously single-family housing starts have declined\n\nsince their peak. This is actually the largest peak-to-trough decline in housing starts to\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\noccur in nearly 50 years. The decline is occurring in what would seem, in fact, to be a\nrelatively benign economic environment, with U.S. unemployment at 5 percent and\ninterest rates low by historical standards.\nHowever, the reduction in credit availability generated by recent, significant\ndisruptions in the securitization of mortgages has made it particularly difficult for\nborrowers seeking subprime 4 and “jumbo” loans. What was likely to be a weak\nresidential market has become a market characterized by major declines as builders seek\nto reduce their swelling housing inventories and as continuing price declines raise the\ncosts of holding on to land or unsold homes.\nThese problems have begun to have an impact on some financial institutions that\nhad taken outsized positions in construction loans, or whose business model was focused\non the types of residential lending most impacted by the downturn. Of course, the\ndramatic decline in housing starts should expedite the process of reducing the inventories\nof unsold homes, and over time provide a basis for stabilizing the housing market –\nalthough with sales continuing to decline, the most recent readings show little or no\nprogress in cutting inventories relative to sales.\nA potential problem for financial institutions is the interaction between falling\nhousing prices and homeowners’ home equity lines of credit (HELOCs 5 ) and junior\nliens 6 (home equity loans). As housing prices have risen over the course of this decade,\nproducts have proliferated that allow consumers to tap into the wealth created by homeprice appreciation. As can be seen in Figure 2, home equity loans and HELOCs have\nexpanded rapidly – together they now account for over $700 billion of bank assets (which\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\naccounts for about one-third of the $2.1 trillion in one-to-four-family mortgages held by\nthe nation's commercial and savings banks as of March 31, 2008).\nUsing home equity can be particularly attractive to consumers because of the tax\nadvantages of borrowing with the home as collateral, the lower interest rate on mortgage\nloans relative to other forms of consumer debt, and the ability to expand the credit line\nduring a period of rapid appreciation in home prices.\nDespite the advantages to consumers, these products are potentially risky to\nlenders during periods of falling home prices. Most financial institutions will not take\npossession of homes when borrowers default on their home-equity loans (junior liens),\nbecause this would require them to assume the first mortgage. With falling housing\nprices, assuming the first mortgage is not an attractive option from the lender’s\nperspective. An additional complication is that default will frequently not occur until the\nhome equity line of credit has been fully utilized, as borrowers who are having difficulty\nmaking payments can tap their credit line again and again. Thus, credit problems may\nfirst appear as rising balances rather than a failure to make payments.\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, the delinquency rates (specifically, the share of loans 90 or\nmore days past due or nonaccruing) on junior liens and home equity lines are rising quite\nrapidly. One should note that most banks were not lending to so-called subprime\nborrowers, but nonetheless, the delinquency rate on one-to-four family mortgages just\nsurpassed the levels seen in the early 1990s 7 .\nAs noted earlier, the rapid rise in delinquencies for home equity lines and junior\nliens held at banks is occurring despite an unemployment rate of about 5 percent – so,\nshould the unemployment rate rise and housing prices continue to fall, financial stresses\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncaused by the housing correction could well spread beyond the large banks involved in\ncomplex securitizations, and the smaller banks with sizeable portfolios of construction\nloans, to a larger set of financial institutions. Not surprisingly, in regions where housing\nprices are falling and delinquencies are rising, we are seeing that banks are beginning to\nreduce the lines of credit available to borrowers.\nA second potential problem for banks is that other types of consumer debt can\nsuffer “collateral damage” from the difficulties in the housing sector. Regions that have\nexperienced falling house prices over the past year are also areas that are seeing some of\nthe larger increases in delinquencies on consumer loans. Banks with significant\nconsumer loan exposures are observing that consumer delinquencies are becoming\nelevated in regions most affected by housing problems.\nTo date, credit problems have been focused on large financial institutions, many\nof whom have shown the capacity to raise new capital. However, should the challenges\nin housing continue, problems could expand beyond securitized assets to have an impact\non the nonsecuritized assets held by smaller banking institutions. It is possible that these\ninstitutions may not be able to tap additional capital quite as easily as larger institutions,\nand if so they may be forced to constrain other lending to address any losses. So I leave\nyou with the cautionary note that while small and medium sized businesses have not\ngenerally experienced significant problems with credit availability to date, further\ndeterioration in housing markets, if it occurs, could carry over and begin to impact\nlenders who serve such borrowers.\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nII.\n\nLength and Duration of Housing Downturns, and Other Recent Research\nfrom the Boston Fed\nNew England is no stranger to falling asset values. As you no doubt know, during\n\nthe early 1990s, New England experienced a steep decline in housing prices. We at the\nBoston Fed think it may be useful to compare that experience to what we have\nexperienced to date with falling housing prices, and we are pursuing a number of research\navenues to do that.\nA new research paper by Foote, Gerardi, Goette and Willen is one example 8 . The\nauthors have, among other things, done extensive data analysis that allows us to compare\nthe current situation to that earlier episode, using publicly available data from the\nMassachusetts Registry of Deeds compiled into a database by the Warren Group. I will\nsay more about our researchers’ findings in a moment.\nSeparately, we are launching today an interactive mapping feature for our website\nthat tracks the rise in foreclosures and subprime activity, then and now\n(http://www.bos.frb.org/subprimegraphics). The next few slides will give you a rough\nsense of how it displays data -- although the site itself will show the year-by-year\nprogressions, dynamically, and I am going to just show you static shots of given years for\nour purposes here today.\nAs you can see in Figure 4 and 5, Massachusetts moved quite rapidly from a\nsituation of relatively limited foreclosures in 1990 to a period of very high foreclosures in\n1992. The timing is interesting. By late 1989, Massachusetts house prices had begun to\nfall, but delinquencies and foreclosures did not really accelerate until there was also a\nsignificant weakening of the economy. In fact, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts,\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwhich had declined to 3.1 percent in late 1987, peaked at 9.1 percent in the second half of\n1991. Declining housing prices alone did not cause very elevated foreclosures; it was\nsignificantly compounded by an economic shock such as the loss of a job which disrupted\nthe ability of many borrowers to make payments. As house prices fell, many\nhomeowners who lost their jobs in the early-1990s recession could not sell their homes to\npay off their mortgages because they owed more than their homes were worth. For\nunemployed homeowners with “negative equity,” foreclosure was often the only option.\nThe more recent period also points to the importance of falling house prices and\nnegative equity in foreclosures. In the more recent period (shown in Figures 6 and 7), the\nforeclosure rate – which was not particularly elevated in 2005 – had become quite\nelevated by 2007 as house prices softened. This increase in foreclosures occurred even\nthough the Massachusetts unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent for the year.\nWhy are foreclosures so high today, given that the economic situation is so much\nbetter than it was during the early 1990s? Even in expansions, many homeowners\nundergo adverse life events – like a job loss, a divorce, a spike in medical expenses, or\nthe like – that disrupt their ability to make mortgage payments. Of course, with regard to\nunemployment, such household-level disruptions are not as prevalent in expansions as\nthey are in recessions. But when such a life event does occur, it can still precipitate a\nforeclosure if the homeowner has negative equity because of a fall in house prices.\nAnother reason for elevated foreclosures today concerns changes in the\nsusceptibility of mortgages to economic shocks. In the late 1980s, many borrowers had\nmade significant down payments and had good credit histories. But the recent ability of\nborrowers with weak credit histories and little or no down payments to purchase homes,\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\noften with subprime loans (and sometimes with minimal income verification), means that\na greater share of today’s mortgages are a good bit more susceptible to the types of\ndisruptive life events that precipitate foreclosure. These borrowers were fine when\nhousing prices were rising because if needed, they had the ability to refinance or sell their\nhomes and pay off (or more than pay off) their mortgages. In contrast, in the current\nenvironment of falling housing prices, borrowers who made small down-payments or\nhave otherwise risky mortgages are now more likely to end up in foreclosure if they\nexperience an adverse event that interrupts their ability to make mortgage payments.\nSo, in short, we have seen similar foreclosure numbers this time around without a\ntechnical recession, and with a more modest fall in home prices. Boston Fed researchers\nattribute that to the prevalence of riskier loans and higher combined loan-to-value ratios\nin general.\nFigures 8 and 9 provide some background on the foreclosure experience by house\ntype. Several interesting patterns are apparent. In the early 1990s, foreclosures rose\nrapidly for all types of homes as the economy deteriorated. While foreclosures peaked in\n1992, they remained quite elevated through much of the decade, despite the eventual\nrebounding of the economy. In addition, that period’s speculative fervor in New England\nreal estate markets had a particularly large impact on the condo market, where a\ndisproportionate share of the foreclosures occurred.\nToday, problems appear most pronounced in the multifamily market. The twoand three-family houses that are prevalent in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods\nin Massachusetts have experienced very elevated foreclosure rates. Specifically, multi-\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nfamily units accounted for 28.4 percent of the foreclosures in 2006-2007, but have\nconstituted only 10.8 percent of residential purchases since 1990 9 (Figure 9).\nThe impact on particular communities can be seen in Figure 10, 10 which shows\nforeclosure petitions by property type in given cities and towns in Massachusetts. In\nBoston, 47 percent of foreclosure petitions between January and August 2007 were multifamily properties. Many of the cities with high concentrations of low- and moderateincome borrowers have also seen particularly high rates of foreclosure petitions 11 on\nmulti-family properties. Our researchers suggest that one explanation for the higher\nforeclosure rate on multi-family properties is found in higher combined loan to value\n(CLTV) ratios, which make them more vulnerable when prices are falling. 12\nStates like Massachusetts and Rhode Island have a much larger concentration of\nmulti-family homes than do many other regions of the country 13 . Streets with a large\nconcentration of foreclosures in major New England cities frequently are dominated by\nmulti-family units. Recently both Boston and Chelsea have begun programs to purchase\nforeclosed multi-family units, to try to prevent these properties from becoming vacant\nand slipping into disrepair, which would bring broader collateral problems for the\naffected neighborhoods.\nBecause many of these properties are investor owned – or the current owner\noccupies one of the units and has limited financial means to deploy should the property\nrequire major capital improvements – programs focused on owner-occupied single-family\nproperties will not address these problems. One area that will need focus going forward\ninvolves strategies to prevent streets of foreclosed multi-unit properties from leading to\nbroader sections of urban decay.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nSeveral lessons from the historical comparison can be highlighted. First, should\nthe economy worsen and suffer a period of significant job losses, the housing problem\ncould become much more severe. Second, past episodes of elevated foreclosures lingered\nwell after the peak in foreclosures had passed, indicating that the duration of today’s\nsituation may be longer than some are anticipating. Third, because the current problems\nhave been concentrated in vulnerable low- and moderate-income areas with a prevalence\nof multi-unit properties, such multi-unit properties will be a more important public policy\nissue in the current situation.\n\nIII.\n\nIssues Complicating the Resolution of Housing Problems\nAs I have noted, a major change in the U.S. housing sector in recent years has\n\nbeen the emergence of the ability to buy homes with little or no down payment and the\nincreased prevalence of such purchases. Many of these purchases are structured with a\nfirst loan that covers 80 percent of the value of the house and a second loan, sometimes\ncalled a “piggyback” loan, which is taken out at the same time as the first. The\npiggyback loan tends to be at a higher interest rate reflecting the greater risk of the loan,\nbut the interest is tax deductible and allows the borrower to avoid purchasing private\nmortgage insurance (which lenders require if the borrower is paying less than 20 percent\nin down payment).\nAs can be seen in Figure 11, until recently, an increasing percentage of homes\nwere being financed with these piggyback loans. In Massachusetts, piggyback loans\nwere used with 26 percent of subprime mortgages in the second quarter of 2003 but that\npercentage increased to 65 percent of subprime mortgages in the third quarter of 2005.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nPiggyback loans were about twice as prevalent for subprime borrowers as prime\nborrowers, and were particularly prevalent in multi-family purchases. In fact, 75 percent\nof subprime multi-family purchases in the third quarter of 2005 involved a piggyback\nloan.\nAt the time of purchase, subprime borrowers frequently used the same lender to\nacquire both the first loan and the piggyback loan. The complicating factor is that these\nloans were frequently then securitized, with the first mortgage and the piggyback loan\noften sold into separate portfolios of loans to be securitized. Thus, even while piggyback\nloans were becoming more abundant, many mortgage-backed securities contained no\npiggyback loans, implying that the borrower’s loans were frequently packaged in separate\nsecuritizations.\nThe combination of piggyback loans, securitization, and legal complexities makes\nit much more difficult to modify loans, particularly if the first and second mortgages have\nbeen packaged into separate securitizations. Dealing with two different lenders or\nservicers, as well as different securitizations, can significantly complicate efforts to\nrestructure loans. Also, loan servicing agreements are not identical and indeed include a\nvariety of forms of authorization (of the servicer) to modify loans. Frequently the only\nleverage the owner of the piggyback loan can and does exercise with a distressed\nborrower is demanding compensation should the borrower seek to modify both loans.\nIn short, while a variety of programs and policies are being considered in order to\nimprove the loan modification process for distressed borrowers and their lenders, a key\nconsideration involves figuring out how to modify loans when the interests of the primary\nloan holder may be different than those of the holder of the piggyback loan.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nA second complication involves targeting the modifications to the homeowners\nwho really need them. We have seen that falling house prices tend to raise foreclosures\nby causing a negative equity situation which limits homeowners’ options (e.g., to\nrefinance or sell and pay off the loan) if their financial situation deteriorates.\nThe rising share of homeowners with negative equity in their house – meaning\ntheir home is now worth less than their loan(s) – might seem to suggest a large group for\nwhom loan modifications would be a “slam dunk.” Principal write-downs to bring\n“underwater” mortgages above water may well be the appropriate solution for some\ntroubled borrowers 14 , but lenders and loan servicers continue to be reluctant to provide\nmodifications in a wholesale manner. Negative equity does not imply foreclosure with\ncertainty – in fact, most people with negative equity situations continue to make their\nmortgage payments. Lenders and loan servicers who are aware of this fact may be\nreluctant to offer a modification if they believe that the homeowner has the capacity to\ncontinue making payments, no matter the hardship.\nTo “unpack” this a bit, I want to spend a moment looking at the history of\nnegative-equity borrowers over the past two decades, drawing on a new working paper\njust produced by Boston Fed researchers 15 .\nIn the late 1980s, house-price declines in New England meant a large number of\nborrowers had negative equity in their house. The Registry of Deeds data allow us to\nstudy the historical relationship between negative equity and foreclosures for a limited set\nof borrowers – specifically, people who purchased homes in Massachusetts on or after\nJanuary 1987, when the Warren Group data begin. Using these data to calculate a rough\nproxy for housing equity, Foote, Gerardi and Willen calculate that 100,288 of these post-\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n1987 purchasers, or 36 percent, were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth\nquarter of 1991 (a high fraction because January 1987 came just before the peak of the\nhousing cycle). 16 Yet of this negative-equity group, only 6,453 (or just 6.4 percent)\ndefaulted on their mortgages within the following three years.\nWhat about today? Using the same rough method to approximate home equity for\nthe same subset of homeowners, the data imply that about 10 percent of post-1987\npurchasers were in a position of negative equity as of the fourth quarter of 2007.\nAssuming that the unemployment rate and benchmark interest rate (the 6-month London\nInterbank Offered Rate or LIBOR) stay at their fourth-quarter 2007 levels, the statistical\ndefault model of Gerardi, Shapiro and Willen predicts that less than 10 percent of these\nhomeowners with negative equity will default.\nContinued declines in house prices, higher unemployment, and possibly a greater\nwillingness to default on home mortgages might raise this estimate of future defaults.\nEven so, many lenders will not be inclined to make concessions unless borrowers clearly\nlack the ability to pay. This is one reason that workouts or distressed borrowers’\nmortgages continue to proceed loan by loan, rather than through wholesale changes in\nmortgage terms. Lenders want borrowers with the capacity to pay to continue to uphold\ntheir legal obligation to do so – and any wholesale change in mortgage terms could\nbenefit borrowers that are still able to fulfill the original agreement. To avoid this\nproblem, some policy proposals 17 maintain the legal obligation for the full loan for the\nborrower, but involve significantly reduced payments in return for the lender sharing in\nany future appreciation of the house.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAnother impediment to restructuring loans that have been packaged into\nsecuritizations involves the legal restrictions imposed on many securitization\nagreements 18 . These agreements allow the servicer to pass through payments by\nborrowers without incurring any tax liability, as long as certain conditions are met. One\nof the conditions is usually that modifications cannot be made to the loans unless the loan\nis either in default or default is reasonably foreseeable. This determination is generally\nmade loan by loan, with wholesale modifications being interpreted by some servicers as\npossibly violating the service agreement and the legal framework used in many\nsecuritizations and thus potentially imposing tax liability.\nDespite some promising proposals, these factors – the presence of piggyback\nloans, the desire of lenders to continue to get paid unless the borrower does not have the\ncapacity to make payments, and the legal restrictions and tax-liability concerns\nsurrounding securitization agreements – make any across-the-board modification of loan\nterms challenging.\nAs long as loan modifications are taking place on a loan-by-loan basis (a timeconsuming and labor-intensive process), to significantly increase the number of loan\nmodifications and avoid significant numbers of foreclosures, many servicers will need to\nquickly expand the pool of staff capable of making these evaluations.\n\nIV.\n\nImplications for Policymakers\nTo reiterate, falling housing prices continue to be a significant source of down-\n\nside risk to the economy. Previous periods of real estate problems have taken significant\ntime to be worked out, with foreclosures remaining elevated well after their peak. The\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncurrent foreclosure problem has been exacerbated by the difficulties related to many of\nthe problem loans being held in securities.\nTo help mitigate the current situation it is important for servicers to have the\ncapacity and the incentive to make loan modifications where appropriate. A challenge\ncontinues to arise around getting borrowers and servicers together to determine if loan\nmodifications are appropriate.\nIn addition, it is clear that servicers were not set up for the spate of elevated\nforeclosures we have already experienced, and further increases in foreclosures would\ncertainly test the capacity of servicers to have sufficient staff with the expertise to make\nloan modification determinations. Nonetheless, I am hopeful that the many mortgage\nforums that are being organized around the country to try to get servicers and borrowers\ntogether to work with problem loans will help some borrowers.\nThe large number of multi-family dwellings entering foreclosure presents a\nserious challenge to cities. Already there are streets in some cities with a high\nconcentration of foreclosed multi-family properties, putting at risk many of the\nsocioeconomic advances made in the last decade in some of these neighborhoods. Cities,\nworking together and with community organizations and state officials, 19 will need to\nfind ways to make sure these low- and moderate-income neighborhoods do not regress as\na result of the current wave of foreclosures. One promising tactic is rigorous municipalcode enforcement that ensures foreclosed properties are maintained. Furthermore,\nservicers must have a process for maintaining foreclosed properties and they must do\nmore to ensure that these properties do not remain vacant for long periods of time.\n\n16\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nFinally, the legal structure for securitizations and mortgage-servicing agreements\nclearly did not foresee the widespread emergence of distressed borrowers, delinquencies,\nand foreclosures that are being experienced. Changes to servicing agreements and\nsecuritization structures that allow more flexibility during times of duress and also\naddress servicers’ liability concerns are necessary. Since different investors in a\nmortgage-backed security have different incentives, more clearly defining the governance\nof these securities would make it easier during difficult times to make modifications that\nare in the borrower’s, servicer’s, and investor’s interests.\nThe extent of eventual housing problems is highly dependent on the outlook for\nthe economy and the future path of housing prices. Fortunately, aggressive monetary and\nfiscal policy actions have been taken to help mitigate some of the downside risk. These\npolicies will likely result in some pick up in economic activity in the second half of this\nyear, which should help to stabilize the housing market.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the\nFOMC).\n2\n\nA comprehensive description of the Bear Stearns situation is available in “Actions\nby the New York Fed in Response to Liquidity Pressures in Financial Markets” –\nTestimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs by\nTimothy F.

Certain lenders\nspecialize in subprime loans, which carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher risk.\nCertain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks,\nespecially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans, although a\nfew large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers\nto the credit characteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have\nweakened credit histories that include payment delinquencies and possibly more severe\nproblems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display\nreduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other\ncriteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime loans\nare loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the time of\norigination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime\nborrowers. Generally, subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk\ncharacteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two or more 30-day\ndelinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24\nmonths; Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months;\nBankruptcy in the last 5 years; Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, for\nexample, a credit bureau risk score (FICO) of 660 or below (depending on the\nproduct/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default\nprobability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or\notherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly\ndebt-service requirements from monthly income.”\n5\n\nThe amount outstanding of revolving, open-ended loans secured by 1-4 family\nresidential properties and extended under lines of credit.\n6\n\nClosed-end loans secured by junior (i.e., other than first) liens on 1-4 family\nresidential properties.\n7\n\nDelinquencies on first mortgage loans and junior liens were not reported\nseparately by banks until 2002.\n18\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M.

Willen,\nKristopher Gerardi, and Chris Foote (forthcoming).\n16\n\nFor this calculation, equity is estimated as the sum of initial equity at purchase\n(that is, the downpayment) plus an estimate of cumulative house price appreciation for\nthat particular home. This estimate is a rough measure for two reasons. First, the data do\nnot allow an estimate of the principal that has been paid down during the life of the\nmortgage. Second, there is no allowance for cash-out refinancing or other types of equity\nwithdrawal. The first of these influences would cause the estimate of home equity to be\ntoo small, while the second would cause the equity estimate to be too large. It is unclear\nwhich factor is quantitatively more important.\n17\n\nSuch as the proposed “Appreciating America” approach, which would have the\nfollowing characteristics (see Refinance.com):\n\n19\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Friday, May 30, 2008,\n12:45 P.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n The homeowner would refinance the outstanding mortgage(s) with an approved\n\"Appreciating America Lender,\" in accordance with established FHA guidelines (i.e.\nwith respect to loan to value and debt to income ratios).\n The first mortgage would be set at some percentage of the current market value of the\nhome (e.g., 85 percent) and would be insured by FHA.\n A second mortgage would be formed to cover the difference between the original\nmortgage balance and the FHA-insured new mortgage, and would be held by the\ncurrent mortgage servicer. Payments and interest (6 percent) on this new second\nmortgage would be deferred for five years or until the home is sold (whichever comes\nfirst).\n To the extent that the value of the home at that point is greater than the FHA first\nmortgage amount, the homeowner would first receive an amount equal to all capital\nimprovements made to the property since the Appreciating America Mortgage closed;\nthen the homeowner would receive 30 percent of the appreciation, and the second\nmortgage holder would receive the lesser of 70 percent of the appreciation or the\nprincipal and accrued interest on the Appreciating America Second Mortgage. All\nappreciation in excess of the second mortgage balance including accrued interest\nwould belong to the homeowner.\n18\n\nThe legal vehicle used for securitized mortgages is a Real Estate Mortgage\nInvestment Conduit (REMIC), which is a pass-through tax entity and investment vehicle\nthat holds a pool of commercial and residential mortgages in trust and issues securities\n(often in multiple classes based on maturity and risk) that represent an undivided interest\nin those mortgages. Major issuers of REMICs include the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCompany (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).\nREMICs are governed by the sections 860A through 860G of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn order to qualify as a REMIC, all of the interests must consist of one or more classes of\nregular interest and one (only one) class of residual interest.\nAn entity that initially qualifies as a REMIC may cease to qualify if a sufficiently\nlarge portion of its qualified mortgages are “significantly modified” and the modified\nobligations are not qualified mortgages. A qualified mortgage is usually treated as having\nbeen significantly modified if the change in terms would be treated as an exchange of\nobligations under section 1001 and its regulations. However, certain changes to the terms\nof an obligation are not considered signification modifications for this purpose,\nnotwithstanding the fact that they may be significant modifications under section 1001\nand § 1.1001-3. The four permitted modifications are (1) Changes in the terms of the\nobligation occasioned by default or a reasonably foreseeable default; (2) Assumption of\nthe obligation; (3) Waiver of a due-on-sale clause or a due on encumbrance clause; and\n(4) Conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the terms of a convertible\nmortgage.\nAs echoed in many Servicing Agreements, the most pertinent modification is one\ninduced by either default or impending default.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nConference on New Challenges for Operational Risk Measurement\nand Management\nSponsored by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMay 14, 2008\n\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to this conference on operational risk, and to offer\nmy thoughts on the lessons for risk-management that we can glean from recent financial\nturmoil. 1 I would like to thank all of you for attending, and the speakers and organizers\nfor their efforts. Like all of you, I am looking forward to the conference and the\nopportunity to, together, take a fresh look at risk management and risk modeling in light\nof recent events.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe practices of risk management in general, and operational risk in particular,\nhave made great strides in the past several years – progress that has been stimulated, in\npart, by the Basel II process. In the past several years risk management information\nsystems have improved significantly, the collection of data related to risk has become\nmore comprehensive, and the analysis of risk and the determination of appropriate capital\nhas become more sophisticated. In addition, within institutions senior management and\nboards of directors have become more attuned to their responsibilities in understanding\nthe risks facing their organizations, and ensuring they have appropriate capital.\nDespite these significant and important gains, there are clearly lessons to learn\nfrom the performance of contemporary risk management practices during the period of\nfinancial turmoil that began in late July.\nAs is shown in Figure 1 – which shows the spread between the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate – the reluctance of\nbanks to lend to each other has been quite elevated since July 2007. A combination of\nbalance sheet constraints 2 , poor transparency regarding potential losses 3 , and heightened\ncounterparty-risk concerns has contributed to less liquid financial markets and\nhighlighted the fact that, in retrospect, even improved scenario analysis and stress tests\ndid not fully capture the potential for events like those that have occurred over the past\nnine months.\nAs the chart showing the LIBOR/OIS spread indicates, there have been ebbs and\nflows in the recent turmoil. I would suggest that the path of the chart’s line reflects the\nthree phases of recent turmoil – beginning with a focus on liquidity risk, moving to\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nincreased concern over credit risk, and now seemingly evolving into concern over\neconomic risks.\nIndeed, initially the widening spread seemed to indicate serious liquidity\nproblems. Problems in the subprime 4 mortgage market and with securitization and\nstructured products – which came to light in the summer of 2007 – resulted in illiquidity\nfor a variety of financial instruments that market participants had assumed had relatively\nlow risk and were highly liquid.\nAs the financial turmoil continued, the primary concern moved from illiquid\nfinancial instruments to concerns about credit risk and likely asset write-downs. Starting\nat the end of 2007 and continuing through the first quarter of 2008, a variety of financial\ninstitutions announced very significant write-downs, and many also announced that they\nneeded to raise additional capital.\nAs we move to a third phase, the focus has shifted to concerns about the economic\nrisks – the risks generated by an economy that has slowed noticeably. While much of\nthe turmoil in financial markets occurred during relatively benign macroeconomic\nconditions, the economic situation has changed. We have seen job losses, unexpected\nand persistent increases in food and energy prices, and falling asset prices – all increasing\nthe risk that less benign economic circumstances will add to the already intense\nchallenges faced by financial institutions this year.\nWith that context it is useful and important to consider the lessons we can learn\nregarding risk management and risk modeling in light of recent events. Today I am going\nto discuss three areas that are important for risk management generally, but also have\nclear applications to operational risk.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n The first area for discussion involves the role of liquidity – and the assumption that\nalways-liquid markets will enable the disposal of assets relatively easily. During\nfinancial turmoil, assets trade less frequently as asset-values dip to liquidation levels\nand dealers and financial intermediaries become less willing to commit their balance\nsheets. While liquidity issues are particularly relevant for credit and market risk, they\nalso have implications for operational risk. For example, consider rogue trading,\nwhereby an institution finds itself with a large unintended position. If such a situation\nbecomes public the institution may face liquidity issues as other market participants,\ntaking advantage of the institution’s need to liquidate or reduce the position, demand\nsteep discounts. So even the announcement of a rogue trader has important\nimplications for the severity of losses that are incurred in such situations.\n\n The second area for discussion involves the challenge of estimating risk models when\nthe historical data are limited. For example, difficulties in accurately estimating\nexpected defaults on subprime mortgages without the benefit of default data from\ndownturn periods 5 , in retrospect, resulted in a significant underestimate of potential\nlosses (a dynamic that was compounded by competitive pressures that led to loosening\nof underwriting standards). This problem is significant in the area of operational risk,\nwhere most firms do not have comprehensive data that extends back even a decade.\nThe reality of such short time series should keep us relatively humble about our ability\nto estimate unlikely events, and lead us to be conservative in our parameter estimates\nand the estimates of capital needed against those risks. Correspondingly, when we\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nhave longer time series, we should be leery of picking and choosing apparently\nrelevant, but smaller, samples – which may lead to underestimates of risk.\n\n The third area for discussion involves the role of scenarios and stress tests in\nevaluating risk. Many financial firms that I talked with when I was leading bank\nsupervision at the Boston Fed conducted stress tests that assumed 10 and 20 percent\ndeclines in national housing prices. Risk managers were well aware of the run-up in\nhousing prices and concerned that they might reverse. When they conducted these\nstress tests, every firm I talked to had concluded that such an event would impact\nearnings, not capital. I noted at the time that I found that curious – since, in my own\nexperience studying economic situations, falling housing prices had not had such\nbenign results. In retrospect, those stress tests were often taking place at firms that\nhave since needed to raise capital because those estimates were so wrong. Given that\nmany firms are now more reliant on scenarios and stress tests for estimating\noperational risk, recent experience should provide a cautionary tale and dispel any\nreluctance or complacency in working to improve these very important practices.\n\nI will cover each of these areas in a bit more detail in a moment. First, however, I\nwant to note that despite a number of lessons from the recent financial turmoil, we should\nnot despair, nor should we see investments in risk management as wasted. Indeed, had\nthe discipline not advanced as far as it has, I believe the recent financial turmoil would be\nmuch more damaging.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAnd as a result of our models and improved risk management, with some nudges\nfrom bank supervisors, banks capital position in aggregate remain quite healthy (See\nFigure 2). The ability and willingness of many financial firms to raise additional capital,\ndespite the financial turmoil, highlights the fact that outside investors have confidence in\nthe long-run strength of these financial institutions and their ability to appropriately\nmanage risk going forward. Already I am hearing about improvements in risk\nmanagement stemming from the current problems, and by building on these lessons we\ncan be better prepared for future problems.\n\nI. The Role of Liquidity\nUnderlying many risk models was the assumption of highly liquid markets. In a\nvariety of markets, assets that were viewed as relatively safe and liquid in July 2007 are\nnow thinly traded – and, when they do trade, do so at surprisingly deep discounts. In\nparticular, there have been very steep discounts for triple-A tranches of asset-backed\nsecurities. Not only have prices dropped as investors have become less certain of the\nlikely default experience of these highly rated securities, but they also include a\nsignificant liquidity premium as investors are avoiding assets that are now viewed as\ndifficult to value. These discounts seem particularly large given the plausible estimates\nof potential losses for these assets – in particular if the economy improves in the second\nhalf of this year, as many private forecasters anticipate. 6\nRecent experience highlights that effective credit risk management requires robust\nevaluation of exposure to possible liquidity strains during times of stress. Experience\nalso highlights the issues that come with being overly reliant on credit ratings as a\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nsurrogate for rigorous credit evaluation. Firms that have significant investments in\nstructured securities may need to consider whether their so-called “Pillar II” capital 7\nallocation is adequate to capture some of the liquidity and model risk that has recently\nshown its importance.\nHowever, traditional credit evaluation is not the only place where liquidity\nassumptions were imbedded, and somewhat problematic. Many firms held funds that\nthey needed for short-term liquidity in auction- rate securities 8 and in funds that invested\nin structured products. (See Figure 3) As these complex instruments have become less\nliquid, many firms have been caught in a cash squeeze.\n\nEven some sophisticated hedge-\n\nfund investors were often too comfortable keeping short-term, liquid funds in complex\ninstruments that encountered difficulties once the financial market turmoil emerged,\nleading to strains on liquidity. Many of these investors have re-evaluated their holdings,\npreferring to reduce risk (and return) in funds held for short-term liquidity purposes, and\nto focus their risk-taking within longer-term portfolios.\nLiquidity can also be a problem in operational risk management. Backroom\nproblems can occur during periods of stress. Particularly as firms have become more\ndependent on using credit-default swaps and tailored derivatives to hedge risk, the cost of\nimperfectly placed hedges (for example a hedge that was faulty due to model error) and\nprocessing problems that can occur during stressful times can generate outsized risks.\nThe most recent example of liquidity impacting the severity of operational losses\nis the illiquidity created by the need to quickly unwind positions generated by rogue\ntraders. Having large unwanted positions that have declined in value can create\nsignificant problems for the institution. Such a firm has few appealing options, in that\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwidespread knowledge of the loss can make it quite costly to unwind the position – but at\nthe same time, failure to quickly reveal the loss can create legal entanglements as\ninterested parties seek legal remedies for the concealment of material information. Many\nof the large rogue-trading losses occurred during periods when trading positions have\ndeclined, and where illiquidity made the unwinding of positions potentially costly.\n\nII. Estimating Risk Models with Limited Data\nEvaluating the risk of new products, or products undergoing significant change, is\na particular challenge for risk managers. The subprime mortgage market is a good case\nin point, as subprime mortgages have undergone significant changes over the past five\nyears. Traditionally, mortgage loans to “less-than-prime” borrowers had occurred\nthrough government programs such as FHA, or in an environment where prime loans\nwere experiencing difficulties. But over the past five years there was a significant\nchange. The advent of securitization and the ability to originate to distribute had a\ndramatic impact on this market. (See Figure 4)\nThe growth in this market benefited from the history of low default rates on home\nmortgages in general. It was often noted that home prices had not fallen nationally since\nthe 1930s, that real estate cycles had not been correlated in different regions of the\ncountry, and that homeowners would go to great lengths to avoid foreclosure on the “roof\nover their heads.”\nHowever, the originate-to-distribute model for subprime lending changed many\naspects of these underlying assumptions. The ability of borrowers to purchase homes\nwith little or no capital greatly expanded the pool of potential borrowers – which, coupled\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwith rising prices, resulted in positive homeownership experiences for so-called\n“subprime borrowers” in the first half of this decade.\nAs regional real estate markets have become more integrated and their prices\nmore correlated, home price declines have been national not just regional. While there\nare certainly some important regional differences, all ten of the metropolitan areas\ntracked in the Case-Shiller index have seen a fall in home prices (See Figure 5).\nThe generally-accepted approaches to modeling subprime mortgage default\nprobabilities frequently did not capture how the economics of subprime lending had\nchanged. For example, models estimated only on the experience of the first half of this\ndecade – the period for which data on securitized, originate-to-distribute, subprime loans\nwere available – did not include significant downturns, did not have falling home prices,\nand did not have the increased correlation of regional home prices. The result is that both\nthe ratings and the capital needed to hold mortgage securities underestimated the risk.\nOf course, the challenges of new products and short historical time series are quite\nfamiliar to operational risk practitioners. 9 Operational risk modeling has been plagued by\nthe short period of time that most institutions have collected comprehensive internal data.\nHowever, even in this short period of data collection, it is striking how many billiondollar operational loss experiences have occurred.\nThe bulk of these billion-dollar losses reflect rogue trading and large legal\nsettlements. Many institutions have viewed losses of this magnitude as “once in a\nthousand years” events, or not applicable to their own modeling – for example because of\ntheir institution’s size relative to that of institutions experiencing those magnitude events\n(a logic that causes some risk managers at smaller institutions to truncate the potential for\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nlosses, perhaps incorrectly). As we get more data, however, it is becoming clear that\nsuch losses at financial institutions are more common than was initially thought. Clearly,\ndiscounting or artificially constraining such losses can risk leaving institutions with\ninadequate capital relative to their risks.\nThe example of subprime mortgages has relevance for operational risk as well as\ncredit risk. The originate-to-distribute model resulted in the loan originator frequently\nhaving little interest in sufficiently screening borrowers. In fact, the desire to maintain\nvolumes appears to have caused some originators to engage in fraudulent actions to\nqualify borrowers. In addition, lawsuits related to subprime loans have emerged, with\nconcerns raised on fraudulent transactions, inadequate disclosure of emerging problems\nto investors, and selling inappropriate products to borrowers. While the likely success of\nthese lawsuits is uncertain, the relevant lesson for risk management involves fully\nconsidering all the potential operational risks with new products, or with new delivery\nmechanisms for existing products.\nOf note are the decisions that some financial institutions made in regard to\nsubprime mortgages. Many large institutions chose not to participate in the subprime\nmarket. In talking with some of these institutions about such decisions, concerns\nregarding reputational risk and potential lawsuits – rather than credit concerns – seem to\nhave played an important role. Other institutions chose to participate, but limited the\nproducts they offered, limited the originators with whom they would do business, or\nimplemented other risk controls to limit exposure to inappropriately underwritten loans.\nIn many respects, these decisions reflect a heightened awareness by senior management\nand Board of Directors regarding operational risks.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIt is noteworthy that some of the most poorly underwritten loans that resulted in\nearly payment defaults were frequently made by financial institutions with little or no\nregulatory oversight. For those institutions whose risk management approach did not\nsufficiently consider the operational risks related to these products, the lessons have\nalready been costly, and potentially large legal risks remain from those decisions.\nThis difference in bank behavior towards subprime mortgages is noteworthy.\nWhile it is difficult to prove, firms that were better versed in operational risk may have\nbeen more careful in considering all the risks inherent in entering this market. Because\nsubprime loans grew rapidly and were quite profitable for a number of years, it took\nsignificant discipline to decide to forego some aspects of the business.\n\nIII. The Role of Scenarios and Stress Tests in Evaluating Risk\nParticularly given the limited data, many banks have significantly increased their\nuse of scenarios analysis and stress tests. While this is a very important and promising\ndevelopment, we must recognize that we are at the early stages of using these tools.\nMany institutions did conduct stress tests of what would happen if housing prices fell.\nMost of these stress tests noted the institution’s limited amount of direct exposure to\nresidential mortgages and construction loans. Others noted that while they held\nmortgage-backed securities, they only held the triple-A tranches of these securitizations.\nMuch of the modeling was a somewhat more sophisticated migration analysis of\ndirect exposures. However, none of the major stress tests I am aware of – done by a\nvariety of financial institutions – came close to capturing the depth of the problems that\nwe are experiencing today.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nWhat was missing was economic and financial analysis that would result in an\naccurate stress scenario:\n\n While the scenarios did capture direct exposures, many did not incorporate the critical\nlink between falling housing prices and the greater incentive they would provide for\nborrowers with little capital invested to stop payments if they experienced an income\nor employment shock.\n There was also insufficient modeling of how securitization would be impacted by\nproblems with subprime securitizations.\n The analyses also overlooked the likelihood that a household that was unable to repay\nits mortgage might also have difficulty repaying its other debts.\n Finally, the effect of mortgage defaults on the ability of many institutions to obtain\nshort-term funding – the liquidity effects I discussed earlier – was often missed.\n\nWith so many such linkages missed, and with undue confidence that the scenario was\nquite unlikely because national housing prices had not declined significantly in the postwar period, some managers took too much comfort.\nOperational risk management has increasingly used scenarios to understand how\nlarge losses can occur at a firm. However, as in the subprime example, scenarios that are\nto accurately reflect risk require a willingness to think expansively about linkages, and\ncannot be artificially constrained by a desire to minimize capital.\nIdeally, scenarios that suggest a need for greater capital should guide the firm in\nconsidering whether it needs new controls, or whether it is able in some other way to\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nreduce the “tail risk” (low probability but high impact) associated with an activity.\nHowever, the scenarios used by firms are often capped or truncated in order to avoid\nincurring a large capital charge, or are assumed to have already been sufficiently\nmitigated even though they have occurred, sometimes frequently, at competing firms.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge arises in capturing legal risk. Most of the largest\noperational losses have been legal losses (See Figure 6). Frequently a firm is quite\ncareful about discussing pending litigation for fear that it might provide information to\nthe litigant. In addition, the probability of litigation and the possible severity should a\ncase be lost or settled remain a “blind spot” in risk analysis.\nI am hopeful that in the coming years firms will be able to improve models of\npotential litigation losses. With the experience of accounting and market-timing scandals\nearlier in the decade, and the litigation likely to stem from the subprime mortgage crisis,\nfirms should have a wealth of data to see if past scenarios captured this risk, whether that\nrisk was elevated to appropriate levels, and whether sufficient actions were taken.\nEven with improvements in scenario analysis there will be significant judgement\ninvolved in the exercise. As behavioral economics has highlighted, it can be very\ndifficult to elicit accurate qualitative information from managers. Generating scenario\ndata that is predictive (that is, forward looking) requires calculated rigor. Thus it seems\nprudent to approach such analysis with a degree of humility. We should recognize the\nlimits to our ability to capture the many interactions among actors and assets in our\nformal approaches, and thus introduce a sufficient degree of conservatism in estimating\nthe potential losses highlighted in the scenarios.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nConclusion\nThe recent financial turmoil has highlighted both the benefits and the challenges\nassociated with pursuing risk management. Clearly, firms that minimized capital\nestimates and did little analysis surrounding the credit, market, and operational risk\nassociated with subprime securitizations have suffered.\nIt is not in the long-run interest of a bank to underestimate the capital associated\nwith significant activities. Such an underestimation results in an over-willingness to\ncontinue to expand in risky areas and – should those risks come to fruition – risks the\nfirm needing additional capital, being acquired, or in the extreme failing.\nEarlier in this decade I asked a risk manager whose firm had just experienced a\nvery significant operational loss how that had influenced the firm’s risk management and\nrisk modeling. The answer I received was that it was a one in a thousand year event; so\nwhile they had instituted some additional controls, it did little to change their need to\nallocate capital for that activity. The next year they had an even larger operational loss in\na related area. While it is certainly possible to have two unlikely events in successive\nyears, the probability is relatively remote. Organizations that too willingly ignore the\nunfortunate events that they or their competitors have experienced only increase the\nprobability that such mistakes will be repeated.\nWhile there have been great strides in risk management practices, risk managers\nneed to be continually pushing their firms to think creatively and expansively about\npotential risks. The lessons from the recent financial turmoil have probably provided\nmore examples than we would have liked. Nonetheless, I am confident that continued,\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndiligent improvement in risk management and risk modeling will make financial\ninstitutions and financial markets even safer and more resilient in the future.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nDuring the recent financial turmoil in the United States bank assets have actually grown,\nparticularly at the largest institutions. Banks have reduced their holdings of government securities,\nbut have expanded their holdings of other securities and commercial and industrial loans. Much of\nthis growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in response to\nliquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the factors that\nhave increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial paper, firms\nexpanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were originated with\nthe expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing the purchase of\nmunicipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being securitized. Such\nfactors can significantly swell bank assets, placing pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull\nback in other areas.\n\n3\n\nI discussed transparency and disclosure in a March speech available on the Boston Fed’s\nweb site (www.bos.frb.org) at the following address:\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2008/030608.htm.\n4\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates\nreflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime\nloans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans,\nalthough a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the\ncredit characteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit\nhistories that include payment delinquencies and possibly more severe problems such as chargeoffs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured\nby credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with\nincomplete credit histories. Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these\ncharacteristics at the time of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than\nloans to prime borrowers. Generally, subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk\ncharacteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two or more 30-day delinquencies\nin the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24 months; Judgment,\nforeclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5 years;\nRelatively high default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO)\nof 660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an\nequivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or\ngreater, or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly\ndebt-service requirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Wednesday, May 14, 2008,\n8:40 A.M. Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nis not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition\nmay not match all market or institution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a\nstarting point from which the Agencies will expand examination efforts.”\n5\n\nThat is, periods characterized by economic or asset-price downturns.\n\n6\n\nThe recent declines in the highest-graded of some mortgage securities implies very\nsignificant losses, as investors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lowergraded securities had been wiped out.\n\n7\n\n“The Basel Framework is divided into three pillars, the second and third of which are new\ncompared to Basel I. Pillar 1: the minimum capital requirements, which include capital\nrequirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk ... Pillar 1 lays down a flexible\nframework within which a bank, subject to a supervisory approval, may apply an approach that best\nsuits its complexity and risk profile ... Pillar 2: supervisory review process (SRP), which adds a\nqualitative element to the quantitative minimum capital requirements of Pillar 1; the SRP mainly\naims at identifying the overall risk of an institution and the main influential factors on its risk\nsituation and to evaluate them from a supervisory perspective. Pillar 3: market discipline, i.e.,\nthe institutions are to be subject to enhanced disclosure requirements in order to make use of the\ndisciplining forces of the markets as a complement to the regulatory requirements.” Source: Basel\nII - the new Capital Accord, from the Deutsche Bundesbank's website (at\nhttp://www.bundesbank.de/bankenaufsicht/bankenaufsicht_basel.en.php)\n8\n\n”Auction-rate securities (ARS) are long-term variable-rate instruments with their interest\nrates reset at periodic and frequent auctions. They are often marketed to issuers as an alternative\nvariable-rate financing vehicle and to investors as an alternative to money market funds. Investors\nhave historically been able to liquidate ARS positions at face value at frequent auctions, leading\nmany to consider them cash-like. After hundreds of auction failures in February 2008, however,\nthe Wall Street Journal declared that the ARS market had ‘virtually collapsed.’” Source: Stephanie\nLee, NERA Economic Consulting, Auction-Rate Securities: Bidder’s Remorse? A Primer. May 6,\n2008\n\n9\n\nMy colleagues in the Bank’s Supervision, Regulation, and Credit area note that such issues\nhave occurred throughout the history of financial innovation; this is not an isolated event. A good\nillustration of this point is the introduction of portfolio insurance in the mid 1980s. Portfolio\ninsurance was a strategy that worked very well for some time, as long as markets were liquid. The\nassumption was that there would always be buyers at a price – and the pricing was done under the\nassumption that the various structural and statistical relationships would remain intact.\nUnfortunately, the strategy failed when it was needed the most, in October 1987. As soon\nas the stock market started crashing a large number of dynamic hedges were initiated to cover the\ninsured portfolios. The number of insurance contracts was so large that it aggravated the market\ndecline and triggered further hedges. The existence of portfolio insurance changed the dynamics of\nthe market and could not have been captured by data collected prior to the introduction of this new\ninstrument.\nAnother similarity between the portfolio insurance and securitization is the fact that\ninvestors ignored the change in behavior due to the introduction of the instrument: portfolio\ninsurance gave a false sense of security to fund managers pushing them to adopt riskier strategies,\nthe same way as securitization introduced moral hazard in the mortgage business.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 1\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - May 9, 2008\n\nBasis Points\n\nBasis Points\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n1-Jan\n\n19-Feb\n\n9-Apr\n\n28-May\n\n16-Jul\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics\n\n3-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n10-Dec\n\n28-Jan\n\n17-Mar\n\n0\n5-May\n\n\fFigure 2\nEquity Capital to Assets Ratio at U.S. Commercial\nand Savings Banks by Asset Size\n1985:Q1 – 2007:Q4\nPercent\n12\n\nPercent\n12\n10\n\n10\nSmall Banks\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\nLarge Banks\n\nNote: Large banks are banks with assets of $50 billion or more.\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports\n\n07:Q1\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q1\n\n04:Q1\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q1\n\n01:Q1\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q1\n\n98:Q1\n\n97:Q1\n\n96:Q1\n\n95:Q1\n\n94:Q1\n\n93:Q1\n\n92:Q1\n\n91:Q1\n\n90:Q1\n\n0\n89:Q1\n\n0\n88:Q1\n\n2\n\n87:Q1\n\n2\n\n86:Q1\n\n4\n\n85:Q1\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 3\nThe Auction-Rate Securities Market:\nAuction Failure Rates in February 2008\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\nData Not Available\n\n80\n\n40\n20\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n2/7/2008\n\n2/11/2008\n\n2/13/2008\n\n2/15/2008\n\n2/19/2008\n\n2/21/2008\n\n2/25/2008\n\n2/27/2008\n\nSource: Lee, Stephanie, \"Auction-Rate Securities: Bidder's Remorse?

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\n2008 Credit Markets Symposium\n\"The Changing Business of Banking\"\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nApril 18, 2008\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. I want to thank the Richmond Federal\nReserve Bank and President Lacker for inviting me to speak on an issue that central\nbankers have been spending significant time thinking about since last July – liquidity and\nsystemic risk. 1\nPresident Lacker and I are seated next to each other at each meeting of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, and since the August FOMC meeting our introductory ritual\nhas been to compare notes on the latest anomaly occurring in financial markets, and the\nnewest acronym or product-name to come to the fore, as formerly niche areas of the\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nfinancial markets get their 15 minutes of either fame or infamy. From CDOs and SIVs to\nauction rate securities and conduits, they clearly have a big impact on the cost and\navailability of funds for consumers, businesses and governmental entities.\nToday I am going to focus on the role of signaling – and specifically, reluctance\nto provide a signal that might indicate weakness – which seems to have played a\nsignificant role in the behavior of many financial market participants of late. I’ll also say\na bit about ways the Federal Reserve has tried to help address the problem, and share\nsome of my own views on what the Fed’s role can and should be in the future, informed\nby my background in both economic research and bank supervision.\nIf I were to select a light-hearted title for my remarks, it might be “Fear and\nLoathing on Wall Street.” The basic premise is that as firms have become increasingly\nconcerned about the valuation (pricing) of certain assets, their ability to accurately assess\ncounterparty risk and the liquidity position of counterparties has become clouded. The\nlack of transparency in the prices of underlying assets, and the significant losses of some\nfinancial firms whose deteriorating situation had not been evident in earlier financial\nstatements, have together made investors skittish. As a result, financial firms are\nincreasingly willing to pass up the use of other attractive financing opportunities if they\nbelieve that action might lead to speculation about the liquidity or financial strength of\ntheir firm.\nWhile such skittishness is not unusual during periods of illiquidity, it is unusual\nfor a period of illiquidity to last this long.\nI would like to provide a simple, non-financial example of the problems\nassociated with signaling, and then proceed to describe some ways that these signaling\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nissues can complicate decisions related to short-run borrowing from the Federal Reserve,\nand affect credit markets more generally.\nLet me say at the outset that concerns about signaling, stigma, and market\ninformation are one reason why the Federal Reserve can play, should play, and has\nplayed a significant role as a liquidity provider. Unlike private market participants, the\nFederal Reserve has no incentive to profit from knowledge of a counterparty’s situation,\nmaking it a preferred counterparty during times of financial turmoil.\n\nA Brief, Non-Financial Example\nI am going to begin with a simple example of signaling that is personal, and\nunrelated to financial markets. I have always been an avid tennis player – although\n“avid,” unfortunately, does not necessarily translate to “accomplished.” I have had the\ngood fortune to pass my enthusiasm for the game on to my son.\nAs he moved to adolescence it was clear that his game had surpassed mine in\nevery dimension. Yet, his success was hampered by a simple signaling mechanism.\nWhen something in my play created a particular difficulty for him, he highlighted the\ndifficulty by throwing his racquet. Fortunately, today's tennis racquets are made from\nalloys that help the Space Shuttle re-enter the atmosphere.\nIt does not take a very wily tennis competitor to realize that the optimal strategy is\nto repeat the same circumstances which frustrated or trumped the opponent – a tactic that\nresulted in an even more impressive trajectory for the racquet. Like my ability to surmise\nand exploit my son’s primitive signaling mechanism, financial market participants are\nhighly sensitive to signals offered by their competitors. And no financial institution\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nwants to do the equivalent of signaling a vulnerability by throwing their racquet –\nparticularly with far more at stake than a family tennis match.\n\nDiscount Window Signaling\nSimilarly, firms’ concerns about signaling have hampered the ability of the\nFederal Reserve to encourage borrowing from the Discount Window during times of\nstress. A particularly interesting example of this occurred last week with the latest\nauction conducted under the auspices of the Federal Reserve’s new Term Auction\nFacility (TAF).\nThe results of the latest TAF auction are shown on Figure 1. Allow me to provide\na bit of background.\nThe TAF is an alternative to a Discount Window loan. Both result in a loan from\nthe Federal Reserve to a financial institution, collateralized by assets that the borrowing\ninstitution has pledged to the Federal Reserve. However, with the addition of the TAF,\nfinancial institutions have two ways to borrow from the Discount Window. They can\nborrow using a traditional Discount Window loan, which is a loan at the primary credit\nrate – traditionally overnight but now up to 90 days term. 2 Currently the primary credit\nrate is 25 basis points over the Federal Funds rate, or a rate of 2.5 percent. Alternatively,\nthey can borrow for 28 days by participating in the Term Auction Facility, where the\nbidder is free to bid for funds at any rate above the minimum required for the auction\n(2.11 percent in the latest auction), and all those bids that are above the stop-out rate get\nthe stop-out rate for the loan.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs can be seen in the graph, last week the stop-out rate was 2.82 percent,\nsignificantly higher than the primary credit rate of 2.5 percent. Such a bid could be\nexplained if market participants believed it was likely that market rates would rise over\nthe 28 day term, but evidence from trading in Federal Funds futures and in overnight\nindex swaps indicate the opposite – that market participants believe it is far more likely\nthat the Federal Funds rate will fall from its current target. Similarly, the TAF stop-out\nrate exceeds the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the rate at which\nbanks can borrow one month unsecured money in London.\nSo how can this seeming anomaly be explained?\nFirst, the Federal Reserve does not trade for profits in the markets, so the firms\ncan bid in the auctions without fearing that their bids imply any immediate signaling of\npotential balance-sheet constraints or liquidity problems to the counterparty, the Federal\nReserve. As a result, firms may be willing to pay a premium for transacting with the\nFederal Reserve in order to avoid any immediate public signaling, and to avoid taking\nactions that could potentially be construed as signaling the existence of problems.\nSecond, firms may want to be sure that they have some term funding, and by\nplacing bids well above the primary credit rate they are in effect offering the equivalent\nof a non-competitive bid in a Treasury auction. They are willing to purchase the use of\nthe term funds at whatever the current market clearing price is in the auction, even if\nthere are less-costly options at the Discount Window or with private parties.\nThird, the winners of TAF auctions are not disclosed by the Federal Reserve. Of\ncourse, neither are institutions that take out Discount Window loans disclosed by name.\nHowever, market participants may believe that the auction process, where a variety of\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nbanks are jointly acquiring funds, may be interpreted differently than an individual\ninstitution borrowing from the Discount Window. 3\n\nSignaling and Short-Term Debt\nThe fact that banks are still choosing more costly financing options to avoid any\npotential signal of liquidity or balance-sheet constraints is very noteworthy – in that the\nfinancial turmoil that began in July of 2007 continues, even nine months after the onset of\nproblems.\nFigure 2 shows short-term interest-rate spreads. As you can see, Libor had\ntracked closely with the Federal Funds rate target in the first half of 2007, but has been\nelevated since the onset of financial problems in late July 2007. This has occurred\ndespite an overnight index swap rate that has been below the Federal Funds target since\nJuly, indicating a market perception that rates were likely to fall below the Federal Funds\ntarget. Since firms in such an environment should be able to borrow Federal Funds at the\nlow rate, and lend funds at the elevated Libor rate, the puzzle is why these rates have\nbecome, you might say, “unhinged.”\nThe volume of term lending transactions has declined significantly, with few\nbuyers or sellers of term funds. I can suggest several reasons.\nFirst, many potential suppliers of funds have become increasingly concerned\nabout their capital position, causing them to look for opportunities to shrink (or slow the\ngrowth of) assets on their balance sheets, in order to maintain a desirable capital-to-assets\nratio. Since unsecured inter-bank lending provides relatively low returns and has little\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nbenefit in terms of relationships, banks may prefer to use their balance sheet to fund\nhigher-returning assets that advance long-term customer relationships.\nSecond, as the uncertainty over asset valuations has increased, banks have\nbecome reluctant to take on significant counterparty risk to financial institutions –\nparticularly with those that have significant exposure to complex financial instruments.\nThird, many potential borrowers are reluctant to buy term funds at much higher\nrates than can be obtained overnight, for fear that they may signal to competitors that they\nhave liquidity concerns. However, when the counterparty is a central bank, financial\ninstitutions have been quite willing to buy term funding, sometimes at rates higher than\nthey would expect if they were to borrow funds overnight.\nThe various liquidity facilities being made available by central banks have helped\nimprove liquidity, and borrowers are more willing to purchase term lending. However,\nthe gyrations in the spread between Libor and the overnight index swap rate shown in\nFigure 3 demonstrate that we continue to have episodes where the spreads become large\nby historical standards. In addition, at times market participants have complained that\nfew if any transactions occur at term Libor rates when uncertainty in the market\nincreases. 4\nWhile actions taken by central banks are improving the supply of term financing,\neventually the confidence in private counterparties to comfortably buy or sell term funds\nneeds to be restored. A key ingredient in this outcome is that counterparties are truly\nwell capitalized and have a financing structure that does not make them susceptible to\ncounterparty runs. Increased capital not only reduces solvency risk, but also reduces the\nneed for liabilities that might flee during periods of financial difficulty. 5\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nUnlike the credit crunch in the early 1990s in the United States, many financial\nfirms have raised significant capital. Unfortunately, while in many cases these equity\nissues have offset recent losses, they may leave little additional buffer should further\ncredit losses occur. A number of large financial institutions have reduced their dividends,\nand given the potential for additional capital shortages it goes without saying that\nfinancial institutions should continue to assess whether further reductions or cessation of\ndividends would be advisable.\nIncreases in capital not only reduce solvency risk but also have salutary\nmacroeconomic implications. Financial institutions that choose not to raise capital\nthrough new equity issues or reductions in dividends are likely to react to capital losses\nby shrinking their balance sheets. Where and how they choose to reduce credit can have\nmacroeconomic implications, as the availability of credit can become a factor for some\nsubsets of borrowers.\nWhile the most obvious loss of credit availability has been the unwillingness of\nmany lenders to continue to lend for subprime mortgages 6 , other areas of the economy\nmay also be impacted as lenders seek to shrink their balance sheets and lower their\nexposure to areas that may be adversely impacted by the current financial turmoil and a\nslowing economy.\nSo far the main effect of the financial turmoil has been concentrated in large\nfinancial institutions that may be able to attract additional investors (see Figure 4). These\ntypes of institutions tended to hold the complicated financial instruments that have been\nmost affected by the financial turmoil. They have also seen their assets grow as they\nhave needed to move some off-balance-sheet assets onto their balance sheet, had lines of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncredit and liquidity options drawn down, and have been unable to distribute loans that\nthey had originated and expected to resell.\nSmaller banks have generally not held these complicated financial instruments, so\nthey have been more insulated from the financial turmoil. 7 They also have not been\nliquidity providers for securities, so they have experienced less unexpected growth in\ntheir assets. As a result, there have been far fewer complaints from small and medium\nsized businesses – generally the clients of smaller banks – about credit availability.\nHowever, it is important to note that the continued health of small and medium\nsized banks will be impacted should residential and commercial real estate prices decline\nin a severe manner. While that is not my forecast, it is only fair to note that for the\nliquidity problems to be confined it is important for collateral values to stabilize.\nSignificant price declines will likely lead to more residential and perhaps commercial\nmortgage defaults not necessarily limited to the subprime market, and thus more likely\nlinked to mortgages held in portfolio by smaller banks. 8\n\nConclusion\nThe extended period of illiquidity – in markets that, a year ago, would have been\ndescribed by most as highly liquid and relatively low risk – highlights the importance of\nunderstanding liquidity risk, and understanding which asset-pricing and accounting\nassumptions rely on liquid markets. The ability to value complex financial instruments\nand the use of market-value accounting for financial statements are integrally tied to\nassumptions of liquid markets. In markets where few if any transactions occur, valuation\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ndifficulties can severely hamper the ability of key market participants to evaluate their\ncounterparty risk and hence the functioning of markets.\nI believe this period of illiquid markets should also cause central banks to reevaluate their roles. For a central bank to play an effective role during financial turmoil,\nit needs to understand the sources of liquidity problems, the interrelationships between\nmarket participants, likely losses, and market participants’ potential reactions to these\nlosses 9 .\nIn my view, this can only be done if the central bank has some form of hands-on\nsupervisory experience with institutions – particularly the “systemically important”\ninstitutions – regardless of who is the primary regulator. The Federal Reserve has been\nfar more effective during this crisis because it has hands-on experience with bank holding\ncompanies that are among the most significant players in many financial markets.\nIn short, there are significant synergies between bank supervision and monetary\npolicy during periods of financial turmoil – synergies that can be used to achieve better\noutcomes for the public as policy makers try to determine the impact of liquidity\nproblems and how changes in credit will impact the broader economy 10 .\nHaving some form of similarly hands-on supervisory experience with any\nsystemically important financial institution that may need to access the Discount Window\nis, in the long term, critically important. We need to understand the solvency and\nliquidity positions of firms that may access the Discount Window – with access, at the\nvery least, to the information any counterparty would require in a lending relationship.\nFor those financial institutions that do have access to the Discount Window, there is\nindeed a need for the Fed to have broader access to information than marketplace\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ncounterparty creditors, if we are to effectively manage our responsibilities as lender of\nlast resort and custodian of financial stability. So, regardless of who is the primary\nregulator, it is important for the Fed to understand the consolidated capital and liquidity\npositions of such firms.\nIn sum, I believe that as we consider these and other lessons learned from the\ncurrent turmoil, we can take appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood that extended\nperiods of illiquidity will occur in the future.\n\nNotes:\n1\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues\non the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nDiscount Window loans are generally described as overnight loans, and had traditionally\nbeen. Due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve in response to market events, however,\ndepository institutions can take Discount Window loans out for any term between overnight and\nup to 90 days. In August 2007 the Federal Reserve Board announced a change to allow the\nprovision of term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower. Then in March\n2008 the Board approved an increase in the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 90\ndays.\nSo, in essence a 28-day term Discount Window loan could be secured by a depository\ninstitution – a loan that would be similar to using the TAF’s structure, but at lower rate.\nAlso, it is worth highlighting that another structural difference between the TAF and the\nDiscount Window is that a Discount Window loan can be prepaid at the option of the depository\ninstitution while the TAF cannot. This suggests that an institution with all other factors being\nequal, and absent consideration of any “stigma” or signaling issues, might use the Discount\nWindow over the TAF.\n3\n\nBy some accounts the reporting of Discount Window borrowing by Federal Reserve\nDistrict is particularly concerning to a firm in a District which has few large participants –\nbecause any large borrowings from within such a District are likely to be done by only a limited\npool of institutions, making market speculation more finely focused.\n\n4\n\nRecently, the financial press has reported on market speculation that Libor fixings are\nbeing under-reported. For example, the Wall Street Journal on April 17 noted that “Bankers and\ntraders have expressed concerns that some banks don’t want to report the high rates they are\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until April 18, 2008,\n8:30 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\npaying for fear of creating the impression they are desperate for cash.” [“British Bankers Group\nSteps Up Review of Widely Used Libor” by Carrick Mollenkamp and Laurence Norman].\n5\n\nRaising and retaining capital is one way to reduce this risk. Other steps could include\nimproving transparency and disclosure practices – particularly around underlying assets, offbalance-sheet risks, and valuation techniques.\n\n6\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates\nreflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime\nloans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans,\nalthough a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\n\n7\n\nParenthetically, the TAF's minimum bid size was reduced to $5 million in February to\nfacilitate the participation of smaller institutions.

Please refer to\nthe following papers for more details:\nSee \"Is Bank Supervision Central to Central Banking?\" by Joe Peek, Eric Rosengren, and\nGeoffrey M. B. Tootell in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. vol. 114 (May 1999): pages 629653. The paper finds that confidential bank supervisory information could help more accurately\nforecast important macroeconomic variables and is useful to monetary policymaking. The\nfindings suggest that the complementarity between supervisory responsibilities and monetary\npolicy should he an important consideration when evaluating the structure of a central bank.\nAlso see \"Does the Federal Reserve Possess An Exploitable Informational Advantage?\"\nby Joe Peek, Eric Rosengren, and Geoffrey M.B.

Tootell in the Journal of Money Credit and Banking. vol. 35,\nno. l 6 part 1 (December 2003), pages 931-946, the authors found that confidential supervisory\ninformation was useful in predicting components of GDP that would likely be dependent on bank\nfinancing.\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 1\nShort-Term Interest Rates Before and After the\nFederal Reserve's April 7 Term Auction\nApril 3, 2008 - April 10, 2008\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\nTAF* Stop-Out Rate\n\n2.8\n\n2.8\n1-Month LIBOR\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\nDiscount Window Primary Credit Rate\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\nFederal FundsTarget Rate\n\n2.2\n\n2.2\n1-Month Overnight Index Swap Rate\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n03-Apr-2008\n\n04-Apr-2008\n\n07-Apr-2008\n\n08-Apr-2008\n\n09-Apr-2008\n\n10-Apr-2008\n\n*Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate, Overnight Index Swap Rate,\nFederal Funds Target Rate, and TAF* Stop-Out Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - April 15, 2008\n\nPercent\n6.0\n\nPercent\n6.0\n1-Month LIBOR\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\nFederal Funds\nTarget Rate\n\nTAF* Stop-Out Rate\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n1-Month OIS Rate\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n1-Jan\n\n1.0\n12-Feb 26-Mar\n\n7-May\n\n18-Jun\n\n30-Jul\n\n10-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n3-Dec\n\n14-Jan 25-Feb\n\n7-Apr\n\n*Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility -- First Auction December 17, 2007\nSource: Federal Reserve Board, Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3\nSpread: One-Month London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) to Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate\nJanuary 1, 2007 - April 15, 2008\n\nBasis Points\n\nBasis Points\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n1-Jan\n\n0\n12-Feb\n\n26-Mar\n\n7-May\n\n18-Jun\n\n30-Jul\n\nSource: Financial Times, Bloomberg / Haver Analytics.\n\n10-Sep\n\n22-Oct\n\n3-Dec\n\n14-Jan\n\n25-Feb\n\n7-Apr\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4\nBalance-Sheet Growth at U.S. Commercial and\nSavings Banks by Asset Size\n2006:Q4 – 2007:Q4\nIndex, 2006:Q4 = 100\n120\n\nIndex, 2006:Q4 = 100\n120\n\n115\n\n115\nLoans at Large Banks\n110\n\nAssets at Large Banks\nLoans at Small Banks\n\n105\n\n105\n\nAssets at Small Banks\n\n100\n\n110\n\n100\n\n95\n\n95\n2006:Q4\n\n2007:Q1\n\n2007:Q2\n\n2007:Q3\n\n2007:Q4\n\nNote: Large Banks are banks with asset of $50 billion or more.\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n5\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nBank of Korea and Bank for International Settlements Seminar\nHousehold Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy\nand Financial Stability\n\nSeoul, Korea\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nI would like to thank the Bank of Korea and the Bank for International Settlements for\nsponsoring this conference on Household Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial\nStability, and for inviting me to participate as the keynote speaker. 1 The planned sessions on\nmortgage finance, consumer credit, and securitization are all particularly topical and touch on areas\nthat, especially since July of 2007, have been of keen interest at the Federal Reserve and at central\nbanks throughout the world.\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nToday I am going to focus my remarks on the key information necessary for central banks to\nmake informed decisions during periods of financial turmoil. In particular, I am going to highlight the\nfact that non-public information about financial institutions has been extremely useful in\nunderstanding the current problems in U.S. financial markets, and in understanding how those\nproblems might factor into monetary policy decisions and other policy matters.\nAt today’s conference we have representatives from a diverse set of countries, and in those\ncountries the responsibilities of the central bank in bank supervision vary considerably. The Federal\nReserve has bank-supervisory responsibilities over bank holding companies as well as banks that\nchoose both to have a state charter and to be members of the Federal Reserve. These supervisory\nresponsibilities, I would argue, have been instrumental in dealing with the current episode of financial\nturbulence.\nIn many countries bank-supervisory roles continue to evolve, but whatever the institutional\narrangements that prevail in your countries, I would argue that hands-on experience as a supervisor\ncan be critically important to the central bank during times of stress and can significantly improve the\nability of the central bank to choose appropriate monetary policy and address problems related to\nfinancial stability.\nTo make that argument, today I am going to discuss four areas where knowledge of\nconfidential, non-public information about financial institutions has been important to central bankers.\nThis is a topic that I investigated a number of years ago with co-authors Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell.\nOur research found that confidential bank supervisory information could be used to improve central\nbank forecasts of inflation, unemployment, and Gross Domestic Product. 2\nGiven the events that have occurred since financial turmoil emerged in July, I am now even\nmore confident of the need for central banks to have the experience and perspective gained through\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nbank supervision, although the institutional arrangements to facilitate those insights are likely to vary\nby country. For me, the information gleaned from the Federal Reserve's role as a hands-on bank\nsupervisor has been particularly useful in thinking about appropriate monetary policy in the following\nfour ways.\nFirst, understanding the size of and basis for likely losses has been useful in highlighting\npotential financial stability issues, as well as in determining where credit availability may become a\nproblem. To be sure, the degree of exposure to loss that is embedded in complex financial\ninstruments has been very difficult to ascertain – for banks’ own managers, let alone bank supervisors\n– as many of the recent losses have involved complex and opaque financial instruments tied to the\nmortgage market. But that challenge notwithstanding, we know that the way that banks are likely to\nbehave is linked to the size of their current and expected future losses; and as supervisors, with access\nto internal bank documents and interactions with bank management, we can estimate them.\nSecond, banks’ balance-sheet constraints can transmit financial shocks to the real economy.\nCapital-constrained banks may be unable to provide loans or extend credit in markets where they are a\nkey source of liquidity. For central bankers to gauge potential balance sheet constraints now and in\nthe future requires a detailed understanding of a bank’s financial position, capital management\nstrategies, and likely management actions.\nThird, as problems spill over from mortgage loans to other types of credit, banks’ actions can\nhave a significant impact on macroeconomic growth. For example, reducing lines of credit on homeequity loans and on credit cards could have a significant impact on consumers and dampen economic\ngrowth.\nFourth, many of the recent proactive steps taken by the Federal Reserve relative to Discount\nWindow lending are facilitated and informed by our role as a bank supervisor. These actions, taken\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nas a lender of last resort, make the central bank a counterparty to banks – which requires an\nunderstanding of a bank’s solvency and its liquidity risk.\n\nOverview: Banks and Financial Turmoil\nOne can find numerous examples of the critical role of banks in periods of financial turmoil.\nIn the United States in the early 1990s, losses on commercial real estate and construction loans caused\ncapital-constrained banks to contract their balance sheets. The result was that even companies with\ngood business prospects found it difficult to secure adequate financing despite monetary policy’s\nefforts to lower interest rates, causing the often-cited \"headwinds in monetary policy.\"\nAnd a sizable literature indicates that in Japan, problems in the banking sector played a\nsignificant role in the so-called “lost decade.” 3 Also, in the mid 1990s, many Asian countries found\nthat their banking sector exacerbated problems that originated in real estate and foreign exchange\nmarkets. We see similar episodes in Europe as well.\nWhy do banks play such critical roles during periods of financial turmoil?\nFirst, their balance sheet structure tends to amplify the effect of economic shocks. Banks are\nhighly leveraged and highly regulated. In order to maintain their capital ratios after experiencing a\nlarge capital shock, banks must significantly shrink assets on their balance sheets – in other words, not\nmake or acquire loans – since their ability to raise capital at such times can be quite limited.\nSecond, while their role in financing business and residential investment has diminished in\nrecent decades, banks remain the primary source of liquidity during periods of financial turmoil.\nBanks extend lines of credit, and these lines are most likely to be utilized when firms are experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. However, banks provide liquidity not only to firms, but also to finance an array\nof complex financial instruments. For example, in the U.S., banks have been providing liquidity to\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nthe commercial paper markets, to off-balance sheet financial vehicles (such as conduits, special\ninvestment vehicles or “SIVs,” and the like), and for municipal financing programs (for example\nthrough auction-rate securities).\nThird, banks are often the main source of financing to smaller firms, and are key marketmakers in a variety of financial markets — one example is their role as dealers for municipal auctionrate securities. Should they choose to shrink their balance sheets, the shift can disrupt bankdependent borrowing and markets where banks are key players.\nIn sum, understanding banks is critical to understanding how financial shocks can be\ntransmitted to the real economy. Unfortunately, understanding how banks are likely to respond to\nproblems requires far more than published financial statements. While U.S. banks report detailed\ninformation on their balance sheets and their income statements, these reports do not provide\nsufficient information to allow central banks to really discern how banks are responding to problems.\n\n1. Estimating Losses\nThe current financial turbulence, like most such episodes, has unexpected sources. In 2006, I\nmet with the risk managers from a number of global banks. They highlighted at that time that they\nsaw little risk emerging from the mortgage market. While they acknowledged the rapid acceleration\nin residential real estate prices, they emphasized that banks were extremely well capitalized and that\ntheir own internal “stress tests” indicated that 10 and even 20 percent declines in real estate prices\nwould result in lower (but still positive) net income at their organizations – in other words would\nresult in a loss of earnings, not capital, for their firms. Obviously, events have been more severe than\nthat, and some of the largest financial institutions have found themselves needing to aggressively seek\na new capital infusion.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nIt is worth highlighting that the banks’ observations about being well capitalized were\naccurate. The attention that regulators have given to capital has caused banks in the United States to\nbe much better capitalized going into these difficulties than they were in the 1990s (see Figure 1).\nThe introduction of the Basel I and Basel II capital accord frameworks, and of modern risk\nmanagement techniques that focus on value-at-risk modeling, have caused banks to increase their\ncapital. Current problems would clearly be worse had this not occurred. Similarly, bank supervisors\nviewed banks as being in good financial health, as indicated by the very low number of banks\nconsidered “problem” institutions by the FDIC 4 (see Figure 2) – although there has been some\nadditional deterioration recently.\nEven with the highly publicized financial turmoil that began in July, most banks remained\nprofitable in 2007 (see Figure 3). While there have been very significant losses announced by a few\nbanks, to date the losses have been at large banks actively engaged in residential mortgage\nsecuritization. Both the number and share of banks reporting losses in 2007 are well below what was\nexperienced during the early 1990s.\nSo how is it that the stress tests by large global banks did not indicate their susceptibility to\nfalling housing prices in the United States? Most of these stress tests assumed that lower housing\nprices would cause elevated losses on construction loans and holdings of subprime 5 loans, but most of\nthe large global banks did not have significant exposure in those areas.\nWhat these stress tests crucially failed to capture was the effect of house-price declines on the\nlarge holdings of highly rated securities that global banks held – the products of mortgage\nsecuritization activities, with their payment streams ultimately tied to the performance of subprime\nloans. In particular, they thought that housing prices nationwide were unlikely to fall, but that even if\nthey did, they would only affect the high-risk slices or “tranches” of these securitized pools of\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nmortgages – and the high-risk tranches were not generally held by U.S. banks. In fact, triple-A rated\ntranches continued to trade close to par when problems in subprime loans first became apparent in\n2007 (see Figure 4 – Markit ABX.HE indices 6 ).\nHowever, since the financial turmoil starting in July, the triple-A rated securities with payment\nstreams derived from subprime loans have more recently been trading as low as 60 percent of par.\nSuch values likely reflect a significant risk premium for holding mortgage-backed assets. The size of\nthat risk premium is somewhat surprising, since the defaults on the underlying subprime assets would\nneed to be quite severe to result in such large losses for these highest-rated and most-secure tranches –\nand investors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lower-graded securities\nhad been wiped out.\nValuation has been made difficult by several factors – including uncertainty over the number\nof borrowers that may eventually default on their subprime mortgage loans as well as the liquidation\nvalue of foreclosed properties in the depressed residential real-estate market, and the large discounts\nthat market participants have placed on complex financial assets tied to subprime loans. In addition,\nthe deep discounts on highly rated securities have made investors skeptical of ratings as an indicator\nof default probabilities. With few trades happening – and many of those trades “distress sales” – the\nactual worth of many of these instruments is quite difficult to determine with confidence.\nHowever, knowing the nature of the exposure and knowing the possible pricing outcomes are\nboth critical to estimating losses that could stem from these assets. Bank supervisors have the ability\nto get detailed information on the banks’ exposures to these assets, their current pricing, and their\npossible future pricing. These insights are critical to understanding the size of likely losses to a\nfinancial institution, and management’s likely responses to the losses (given an environment of falling\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nhousing prices, and the prevalence of underwriting problems with many subprime loans originated\nafter 2004).\n\n2. The Importance of Balance Sheet Constraints\nHow banks manage their lending in the face of balance-sheet constraints can have significant\nmacroeconomic effects. If banks are unwilling to lend in the subprime and jumbo markets because\nthese loans are now difficult to securitize, the recovery of residential real estate may be impeded. If\nbanks cut back on loans to businesses, business fixed investment and investment in commercial\nproperty may be impeded. If banks choose to reduce lines of credit to consumers, consumption may\nbe impeded. These examples simply underline the fact that during a period of financial turmoil it is\nimportant for central bankers to understand the degree of balance sheet constraint, and how banks’\nmanagement may choose to respond.\nAs Figure 5 illustrates, during the recent financial turmoil in the United States bank assets\nhave actually grown, particularly at the largest institutions. Banks have reduced their holdings of\ngovernment securities, but have expanded their holdings of other securities and commercial and\nindustrial loans.\nMuch of this growth likely reflects “involuntary lending” – that is, banks expanding assets in\nresponse to liquidity commitments they extended during the previous good times. Some of the factors\nthat have increased assets on balance sheets have included the inability to roll commercial paper, 7\nfirms expanding their use of lines of credit, the inability to sell leveraged loans that were originated\nwith the expectation that they would be quickly distributed, liquidity triggers forcing the purchase of\nmunicipal bonds, and the inability to sell assets that were in the process of being securitized. Such\nfactors can significantly swell bank assets, placing pressure on capital-constrained banks to pull back\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nin other areas. And banks’ choices regarding which types of credit to shrink can have macroeconomic\nconsequences.\nSuch information can only be known with detailed knowledge of the bank’s assets, both onbalance sheet and off-balance sheet, and information about which business lines each institution views\nas critical in the event it is forced to shrink (in other words, to cut back on credit extension) in some\nareas.\nIndeed, calculating how constrained banks are likely to become is not straightforward. One\ncomponent is understanding the size of any possible losses that reduce banks’ capital. At the same\ntime, the likely growth in bank assets can also be very important – and it is virtually impossible to\nestimate without on-going discussions with bank management, such as occur in management’s\ndiscussions with bank supervisors.\n\n3. Potential for Spillover to Retail Consumption\nWhile the problems at many large banks originated with subprime mortgages and\nsecuritization, policymakers and others are rightly paying attention to potential spillovers. As banks\nhave seen housing prices decline, they have been reducing lines of credit associated with credit cards\nand home-equity loans. Declining home prices, which are a key driver of subprime defaults, 8 also\nerode the collateral value for home-equity lines. Thus, geographic areas that are experiencing falling\nhome prices are likely seeing less credit available on home-equity lines, even if credit scores have not\nchanged.\nSimilarly, banks are noticing – perhaps not surprisingly – that nonperforming credit card loans\nhave increased more in areas with elevated home foreclosures. 9 As a result, some banks are\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nreexamining their risk exposure for lines of credit in areas with falling home prices and elevated\nmortgage problems.\nConsumers who are informed that their credit lines have been reduced or possibly limited to\nloans outstanding lose an important financing option, which may dampen their consumption spending.\nTo the extent that untapped lines of credit serve as a precautionary source of funds, consumers may\nreduce their willingness to purchase items. And purchases will likely fall for consumers who find\nthemselves limited to current cash flow.\nLet me emphasize that it is too early to determine the degree that consumers will be restrained\nby credit availability in the current situation. But such trends will be easier to detect sooner and more\naccurately if the central bank has supervisory engagement with financial institutions.\n\n4. Bank Supervision and the Lender of Last Resort\nI would argue that it is very difficult for a central bank to be an effective lender of last resort\nwithout significant knowledge of the current and prospective value of assets and liabilities within\nfinancial institutions. Like any counterparty, a central bank acting as a lender needs to be able to\nevaluate the solvency and liquidity of a borrowing institution.\nOf course, determining future solvency of an institution can be challenging, particularly when\nassets are difficult to value. Knowing how likely it is that an institution’s sources of funds will\nevaporate during times of financial stress requires a significant understanding of the institution’s\nliabilities and its counterparty relationships. Such information has been particularly important of late,\nas the Federal Reserve has initiated a variety of innovative techniques to provide liquidity to the\nmarketplace.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nFigure 6 provides a list of the various steps taken recently by the Federal Reserve related to\nour Discount Window – steps we have taken to try to enhance market liquidity and prevent ripples of\ndifficulty that impact more institutions and ultimately the real economy and individuals. Because of\nthe complexity and institutional details involved in each of these steps taken, I will focus today only\non one, the Term Auction Facility.\nThe Term Auction Facility allows banks to obtain short-term financing using as collateral a\nsubset of assets that the marketplace is currently seeing as illiquid. It has also provided an\nopportunity for banks to get financing for approximately one month during a period when obtaining\nsuch financing has sometimes proved difficult. Every other week, the Federal Reserve holds an\nauction where banks are able to use collateral at the Discount Window to get a loan. Currently the\nsize of each auction is $50 billion. The auctions have been well received, and have generally resulted\nin financing terms (determined by the auction) that are somewhat above the Federal Funds rate.\nTo qualify, a bank first needs to be in sound financial condition, as the Federal Reserve must\nhave confidence that the bank will be solvent over the time the loan is extended. While this\ndetermination is left to the individual Reserve Bank whose district the institution resides in, it\ngenerally requires that the bank not have low supervisory ratings. Second, the institution needs to\nhave collateral at the Federal Reserve. Our Discount officers determine, as best they can, the market\nvalue of the collateral and apply an appropriate “haircut.”\nThere is little question in my mind that both the determination of the potential solvency risk\nand the evaluation of the institution’s collateral are greatly aided by having experienced bank\nsupervisors at the central bank.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED Until 9 AM on Friday, March 28, 2008 in Seoul, Korea or Upon Delivery, and\n8 PM on Thursday, March 27, 2008 U.S. Eastern Time\n\nConclusion\nTwo years ago, few analysts were anticipating significant retail credit and banking problems.\nThe most recent banking problems in the United States had been driven by problems in commercial\nreal-estate loans. The current turmoil stems from troubles with residential real estate loans that are\nfor the most part only indirectly owned, through securitizations.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings applied to relatively new and opaque financial products\nand the difficulty in pricing complex financial assets have seriously disrupted the “originate to\ndistribute” model of recent real estate finance. In particular, it is clear that instruments that involve\nfinancing long-term assets with short-term liabilities, without institutional liquidity backing them up,\nare not especially suited to withstand times of financial distress such as the one we are facing.\nToday I have argued that knowledge of financial institutions has been a critical component of\nmy own thinking as a central banker. In my view, central banks with potential counterparty risk as a\nlender of last resort need to have sufficient information to assess the solvency of their counterparty\nand the liquidity of its collateral – the same factors that any private counterparty would require.\nMuch of our understanding of the economy’s evolution since July has been greatly influenced\nby turmoil affecting financial markets. The economy’s path will vary depending on the size and\nnature of the problems at financial institutions, the distribution of those problems, and the reaction of\nbank management to those problems.

The rating is based on a scale of\n1 to 5 in ascending order of supervisory concern. ‘Problem’ institutions are those institutions with financial, operational,\nor managerial weaknesses that threaten their continued financial viability. Depending upon the degree of risk and\nsupervisory concern, they are rated either a ‘4’ or ‘5’. For all insured commercial banks and for insured savings banks for\nwhich the FDIC is the primary federal regulator, FDIC composite ratings are used. For all institutions whose primary\nfederal regulator is the OTS, the OTS composite rating is used.” Source: Definitions section of FDIC Quarterly Banking\nProfile (Fourth Quarter 2007).\n\n5\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than prime loans, often\nbecause of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders,\ntypically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do\nnot make subprime loans, although a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the credit characteristics of individual\nborrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that include payment delinquencies and possibly\nmore severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment\ncapacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with\nincomplete credit histories. Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the\ntime of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime borrowers. Generally,\nsubprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following: Two\nor more 30-day delinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24 months; Judgment,\nforeclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5 years; Relatively high default\nprobability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO) of 660 or below (depending on the\nproduct/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt\nservice-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after\ndeducting total monthly debt-service requirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and\nis not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition may not match all\nmarket or institution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a starting point from which the Agencies will\nexpand examination efforts.”\n6\n\n“The ABX index represents a basket of credit default swaps linked to subprime mortgages.

This reduction in the availability of short-term funds\ncaused the rates on ABCP to rise; and also forced some financial institutions to buy back ABCP that they could no longer\nrefinance, bringing it onto their balance sheets. The combination of uncertainty over the appropriate rating of mortgagerelated securities and the expansion of bank balance sheets caused significant pressure on the availability of short-term\ncredit. In addition banks, as liquidity providers, were expanding their balance sheets in other areas, much of which was\nnot anticipated prior to the financial turmoil. Some banks have had to take write-downs on some assets, and the losses in\ncombination with involuntary growth in assets have made some banks more reticent to expand their balance sheets further.\n\n8\n\nSee “Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures,” Working Paper\nNo. W07-15 by Kristopher Gerardi, Adam Hale Shapiro, and Paul Willen, available on the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston’s website, www.bos.frb.org.\n\n9\n\nIn March 4 testimony, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn noted that delinquency rates on credit\ncards and consumer installment loans had increased over the second half of 2007.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nSouth Shore Chamber of Commerce\nQuincy, Massachusetts\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today.\nMy goal is to share with you what I see as some “early lessons” from the ongoing\nperiod of turmoil in real estate and credit markets. 1 It is important, given the turbulence\nwe have lately experienced, to begin to analyze and act on such lessons as early as\npossible.\nFirst, some background. For the past two years, the housing market has gone\nfrom bad to worse. What began as a mild reduction in residential investment 2 at the start\nof 2006 has accelerated, with residential investment declining by more than 20 percent\nduring each of the last two quarters of 2007.\nBeyond the obvious and intense pain for distressed borrowers, a noteworthy\naspect of this downturn in residential investment has been its impact on financial markets.\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nPrevious housing downturns caused problems for savings institutions and banks that were\ngenerally smaller than the large financial institutions being affected today. This\ndownturn has primarily affected financial markets and large financial institutions. Large\nfinancial institutions have lost billions of dollars, and in some cases tens of billions; and\nsome are forecasting significant additional losses. 3\nBut this is not just a Wall Street problem. Our real concern is the ways those\nproblems in financial markets translate back to all of us.\nAfter a brief background on the genesis of the current financial turmoil, I am going\nto discuss three issues that I am sure you are increasingly seeing reported on the business\npages of your national and regional newspapers:\n\n First I will discuss why the accuracy of ratings on securitized mortgage\nproducts have been so much less reliable than ratings for corporate-debt\nsecurities, and the lessons we should draw from those differences. Here is a\npeek at the main message: uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety\nof markets to become less liquid. Less liquid credit markets can hurt borrowers\nof every type. Problems with the accuracy of ratings had their roots in the\ndeterminants of the ratings – and so we need ways to differentiate ratings that\nhave different “drivers” in terms of the credit risk on the underlying assets. We\nneed for example, to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from\nratings on assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different,\nand less well understood, like certain mortgages-related securities.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n Second, I will touch on the difficulty in pricing complex financial instruments,\nand actions that might help with transparency and pricing of these products in\nthe future. Again, the main message: As I see it, the recent difficulty in pricing\nassets should make investors and financial intermediaries consider whether such\ncomplexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more\nstandardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded\ninstruments.\n\n Third, I will discuss the continuing problems in the housing market, and touch\non the ongoing discussion of policies that might help mitigate those problems.\nHere I’ll suggest that, if housing prices continue to fall, we will need to\nincreasingly consider programs for those with negative as well as positive equity\nin their houses.\n\nBackground On Recent Financial Turmoil\nFirst, a bit of background. In early 2007 it became apparent that delinquencies on\nsubprime 4 mortgages issued after 2004 were experiencing problems at a more rapid rate\nthan would be expected, given the rather benign economic environment. We began to see\nan elevated rate of subprime delinquencies [Figure 1].\nIn July of 2007, rating agencies began to highlight the fact that subprime\nmortgages that had been securitized – a process I’ll describe in a moment – were\nperforming poorly, leading to downgrades for securities that had significant exposure to\nthe subprime market. Just as investors became more uncertain about valuing these\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nsecurities, it became clear that subprime mortgages were part of various financial\ninstruments that had been viewed as generally low risk.\nSecuritization relied on the reasonable premise that subprime loans might be more\nrisky than prime, but the majority would not default – and higher interest rates and fees\nwould compensate for those that did. Subprime loans were bundled for investors and\n“riskiness” was tiered. Investors in the least risky tiers were thought to be well protected\nfrom losses. 5 [Figure 2] Unfortunately, underlying assumptions proved inaccurate.\nThe market for short-term asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), short-term\nsecurities used to finance a variety of loans from student loans to home equity, has been\nparticularly impacted [Figure 3]. As problems with mortgage-related loans emerged,\nsome investors became reluctant to continue lending in the ABCP market. This reduction\nin the availability of short-term funds caused the rates on ABCP to rise; and also forced\nsome financial institutions to buy back ABCP that they could no longer refinance,\nbringing it onto their balance sheets. The combination of uncertainty over the appropriate\nrating of mortgage-related securities and the expansion of bank balance sheets caused\nsignificant pressure on the availability of short-term credit. In addition banks, as liquidity\nproviders, were expanding their balance sheets in other areas, much of which was not\nanticipated prior to the financial turmoil. Some banks have had to take write-downs on\nsome assets, and the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets have made\nsome banks more reticent to expand their balance sheets further.\nAn indication of the difficulties in short-term financing markets was the marked\nelevation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) relative to the comparable U.S.\nFed Funds target rate. LIBOR is the rate charged in a key international market for short-\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nterm lending between banks. The elevated LIBOR rate not only made it difficult for\nbanks to borrow short-term, but also raised the rates on loans tied to LIBOR -- notably\nincluding most subprime mortgages, corporate loans, and credit card debt.\nIndeed, while the initial trigger for the financial turbulence was related to\nsubprime mortgages, the uncertainty surrounding ratings of complicated financial\ninstruments has caused disruptions in a variety of other assets and markets that depend on\nsecuritization – including state and municipal financing, student loans, and commercial\nreal estate. The effects have been felt up and down Main Street, as well as in some\nmarkets overseas. 6\n\nI.\n\nThe Role Of Credit Ratings\nWith that as background, I’d like to turn to my first subject today – the role\n\nplayed by the credit ratings used by investors to gauge the credit risk on securities.\nThe use of credit ratings for corporate bonds has been longstanding and generally\nfree from substantial concerns about the ratings’ accuracy, with a few notable\nexceptions. 7 So I think it is useful to consider the similarities and differences between\nrating corporate securities and mortgage securities, where the accuracy of ratings has\nbeen called into question. This is particularly important because much of the current\nturmoil is driven by investor uncertainty in rating difficult-to-value financial assets.\nRelative to mortgage securities, ratings on corporate securities have been time\ntested. Downgrades have been quite modest. Defaults have often been tied to recessions\nor problems specific to a given firm, such as excessive leverage or poor management\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n[Figure 4]. In addition, investors in corporate securities can rely on a wealth of external\nsources to verify the health of a firm. 8\nCorporate ratings have generally performed well. Despite the recent financial\nturmoil, corporate default probabilities in aggregate remain quite low [Figure 5]. With\nrelatively few downgrades, and delinquencies, the corporate balance sheet has held up\nbetter than that of the consumer – although the recent widening of spreads for lowergrade bonds gives one pause [Figure 6].\nThe mortgage market is quite different. Most mortgage securities are based on a\ndiversified pool of underlying mortgages. Many investors assumed that there would be\nsignificant benefits from diversification, that regional real estate shocks would be\ndominated by local factors, and that national home prices were very unlikely to decline.\nThese assumptions proved to be wrong, resulting in widespread downgrades of mortgage\nsecurities.\nThe housing price assumption in particular has been critical, and many investors\nmay have significantly underestimated a potential national housing price decline and its\neffect on defaults. The S&P Case-Shiller national home price index fell 10 percent from\nits peak in the second quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007. Home prices\nare down in every one of the 20 large metro areas covered by the Case-Shiller national\nhome price index.\nIn contrast to corporate securities, corroborating information on mortgage\nsecurities is not as readily available. There is no equivalent to equity analysts and equity\nprices to give investors updated market information. The information needed to analyze\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe individual mortgages in the pool can be expensive to obtain. So investors are more\nreliant on rating agencies than they are with corporate securities.\nThe problems in the mortgage market highlight the need for caution where there\nhas been limited ratings history, where the underlying characteristics that drive the asset’s\nprice may not be fully understood or anticipated, and where evaluations cannot be easily\ncorroborated by others such as equity analysts. 9 Certainly one way to highlight these\ndifferences is to differentiate ratings on corporate securities from ratings on assets like\nmortgage-backed securities.\n\nII.\n\nTransparency and Disclosure\nNow I’d like to turn to a second area, transparency and disclosure. The\n\nheightened uncertainty surrounding ratings has been aggravated by the lack of\ntransparency in the pricing of complex financial instruments. Because as many of the\nmore complicated financial instruments have ceased active trading, determining a market\nprice has become quite difficult.\nWhile defaults in housing move rather slowly, the pricing of financial assets has\nmoved much more dramatically, causing many financial institutions to significantly\nchange their expectation of losses from these complex financial instruments. In fact, the\nhighest-graded securities are selling at a very significant discount [Figure 7], implying a\nsignificant risk premium for holding even the highest quality securities of some complex\nfinancial instruments.\nThe opaqueness in pricing has caused a variety of complications:\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n First, many securities have become illiquid, and sales are only occurring at\n“distress” pricing. 10\n\n Second, the uncertainty in pricing has caused a loss of confidence in firms that\nprovided insurance on high-graded securities. This has been a problem for\ncertain municipal securities, and instruments known as auction-rate securities 11\nand variable-rate demand notes 12 where uncertainty in bond insurance has led\nto changes in pricing for securities previously thought to have little risk of\ndefault.\n\n Third, banks often provide liquidity backstops should securities trading\nbecome illiquid, and the current market turmoil is leading banks to be more\ncautious in lending because they are not sure if or when investor demand could\nevaporate, requiring significant extensions of bank credit.\n\n Fourth, certain markets have been disrupted, as investors avoid complex\nsecurities where liquidity could be a problem. The recent reports of problems\nin auction rate securities, suggest that financing for all sorts of entities –\nuniversities or hospitals or some municipalities – can get a lot more expensive\nwhen investors lose confidence in the pricing and liquidity of financial\ninstruments.\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nSo, what lesson should we derive from some of these complications?\n\nFirst, some financial products were not well designed to withstand liquidity\nproblems. To avoid paying banks fees to provide a liquidity backstop, many financial\nproducts of recent vintage included provisions to force liquidation when necessary to\ninsure payment to the holders of the higher-graded securities (or slices of securities).\nThis structure was used, for example, by structured investment vehicles (SIVs) 13 .\nHowever, due to the recent financial stress, assets of SIVs could not be liquidated at\nprices felt to be reasonable. Broadly speaking, products should be structured to better\nweather periods of illiquidity, and ratings models should take better account of liquidity\nrisk.\nA second way to improve price discovery would be to have greater uniformity in\nfinancial products. Standardization of products makes it much easier to price and trade\nsecurities. A case in point: many of the positive innovations in mortgage markets\nresulted from more uniform standards for conforming loans. Standardization helped\ninsure minimum underwriting standards. 14 Non-conforming mortgage markets, as well\nas other securitized assets, might well benefit from greater uniformity and standardization\nso that pricing is less idiosyncratic to the particular security an investor holds. 15\nA third possibility is to seek more trading of financial products in exchanges\nrather than through dealers. Securities that are consistent enough to trade on an exchange\nare more likely to have market prices that all participants can use. 16\nFinally, investors should give careful consideration to whether such complex\nfinancial products are necessary at all. With simpler and more understandable structures,\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe difficulties in obtaining market prices are likely to be significantly reduced, as are the\nconsequent uncertainties like those we are currently facing.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Housing Market\nNow I’d like to turn to the continuing problems in the housing market, and a few\n\nthoughts on policies might help mitigate those problems.\nThe housing market was the genesis of current financial turbulence, and a key\npoint is that significant further declines in home prices could greatly complicate efforts to\nresolve current problems. As housing prices fall, loan-to-value ratios will rise, in some\ncases exceeding 100 percent, reducing the number of borrowers that qualify for existing\ngovernment programs like Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans. 17 Thus when\nconsidering ways to mitigate the current housing problem, it is useful to consider\nborrowers that still have positive equity in their house, as well as those that do not.\nFundamentally, I encourage worried borrowers who hold high-rate loans to\napproach a responsible lender about refinancing. I also encourage lenders to reach out to\nborrowers, and to take a fresh look at the state and federal programs that can be of\nassistance.\nIn recent months we estimated that a fair number of borrowers with subprime\nmortgages may be able to refinance into a more affordable loan, because they had good\ncredit scores and some home equity when they got a fully documented loan on an owneroccupied property. As time goes by, however, declining home prices are eroding\nborrowers’ equity, and some are experiencing financial difficulties or mounting debt as\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe economy slows. These forces complicate the picture, and narrow the pool of readily\n“refinanceable” subprime loans.\nGiven the worsening housing scene, Boston Fed researchers recently updated\nprior work in this area in an attempt to calculate the share of people with subprime loans\nwho might qualify for FHA programs. They looked at subprime loans in Rhode Island,\nConnecticut, and Massachusetts that had full documentation, were owner occupied, had a\nloan-to-value (LTV) of no greater than 97 percent, met current FHA loan-size limits by\ncounty, were never 60 days delinquent, and had a maximum debt-to-income ratio\n(including other forms of debt) of 45 percent. 18 This approximates current FHA\nstandards.\nThey estimate that about 16 percent of borrowers with subprime loans would meet\nthose criteria. However, over time this pool is likely to shrink, as the number of\ndelinquent borrowers has been rising and housing prices have been falling, likely\nreducing the number of qualified borrowers. For borrowers that could convert their\nsubprime loan to an FHA-insured loan, saving significant money from converting from a\nsubprime to a prime rate is an alternative that should be considered.\nOne refinance option is the Mortgage Relief Fund\n(www.MortgageReliefFund.com). [Figure 8] Five large banks joined forces to set up\nthis program, with the encouragement of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to join\nforces in reaching out to borrowers with high-rate loans. The banks can help borrowers\nexplore refinancing into a more-affordable loan – maybe an FHA loan, a state-guaranteed\nloan, or a conventional loan. We believe a number of community banks will join the\neffort in the coming months.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nWith two months completed, and realizing the lags from first contact on a\nmortgage to closing, the banks have logged over 1,000 inquiries, taken in more than 50\napplications, made 115 referrals to nonprofit housing counseling services, and are now\nstarting to close some of those loans from the first applicants – with the first dozen loans\nhaving recently closed. It is a modest start, but this month we are pursuing a second\nwave of outreach, and the banks are pursuing an additional advertising push, especially in\nareas with higher concentrations of subprime loans. We see the effort as a marathon, not\na sprint, and we are refining and adding to it as we go.\nAs I noted a moment ago, as delinquencies and home prices shrink the pool of\npotential borrowers in existing Federal and state programs, an important consideration for\nlenders and policymakers involves the situations of borrowers whose loan now exceeds\nthe value of their house. Of course, any remedies need to take into account the future risk\nto taxpayers, and the incentives created for borrowers and lenders. But we need to weigh\nthat against the problems for communities that can occur with widespread foreclosures –\nincluding the negative effects on neighboring homeowners, the burden on tenants, and the\ncosts borne by municipalities and communities in addressing blight and crime in areas of\nclustered foreclosures.\nAs Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday, 19 this\nsituation calls for a vigorous response – but care must be taken in designing solutions, so\nthey represent safety and soundness for lenders and are characterized by fairness and\nminimal “moral hazard.” I would note that foreclosure costs are often substantial to\nlenders (and by extension, I would add investors) – of course it goes without saying that\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthey are painfully costly on many levels for borrowers. So there is considerable scope for\nnegotiating a mutually beneficial outcome.\nSomewhat along those lines, some parties are proposing variants of a “shared\nappreciation” loan approach. 20 Lenders could write down the loan amount to the current\nhome value, cap losses, avoid the costs associated with foreclosure, and receive a share of\nany future home appreciation when the buyer sells. The borrower could avoid\nforeclosure and reduce monthly payments. 21 The FHA could provide insurance, but\ndefray the increased risk with a share of the gains when the homeowner sells.\nApproaches like this, and other worthy ideas that are being proposed, should be debated\nby policymakers and interested parties – but without delay.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nAs I noted at the outset, the current financial turmoil is ongoing but it is not too\nsoon to consider lessons learned.\nThe uncertainty surrounding ratings has caused a variety of financial markets to\nbecome illiquid and caused very significant write-offs at major financial institutions.\nConsidering ways to differentiate ratings on assets like corporate securities from ratings\non assets whose ratings histories and price-drivers may be quite different, and less well\nunderstood, is probably a first important step.\nThe difficulty in pricing assets should make investors consider whether such\ncomplexity is necessary, and whether some of these instruments should be more\nstandardized or possibly moved from dealer markets to exchange-traded instruments.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn the housing area, thought will likely be needed regarding programs for those\nwith negative as well as positive equity in their houses. As long as housing prices\ncontinue to fall, the decline increases the risks to borrowers, lenders, markets and the\neconomy.\nI thank you for exploring with me today these problems that have roiled Wall\nStreet, and are beginning to significantly affect Main Street. We are facing some unique\nand complex challenges in all of these areas. Let me leave you with the thought,\nhowever, that there may be a significant cost to delaying needed actions that could restore\nconfidence in the ratings process, the pricing of financial assets, and the impact of\ndeclining house prices.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nGDP is essentially the value of goods and services put in place during a time period, and residential\ninvestment is the housing component of GDP. “The main indicator of the quantity of new housing supplied\nto the economy is the residential fixed investment series from the national income and product accounts.\nResidential investment is made up of new construction put in place, expenditures on maintenance and home\nimprovement, equipment purchased for use in residential structures (e.g., washers and dryers purchased by\nlandlords and rented out to tenants), and brokerage commissions.” (Source: “Residential Investment over\nthe Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter\n#2006-15; June 30, 2006). \"Brokers’ commissions…are part of the cost of acquiring a house and,\ntherefore, a capital expenditure.\" (Source: \"National and Regional Housing Patterns\" by Lynn Elaine\nBrowne in the New England Economic Review, July/August 2000, published by the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston).\n3\n\nFor example see Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin (2008), “Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the\nMortgage Meltdown.” presented at the 2008 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum on February 29, 2008. Using\nthree different methods, they conclude that mortgage related losses will be $400 billion.\n4\n\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than prime loans,\noften because of the borrowers’ credit history. The loans carry higher interest rates reflecting the higher\nrisk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime loans. Banks, especially\nsmaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans, although a few large banking\norganizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the credit\ncharacteristics of individual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninclude payment delinquencies and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and\nbankruptcies. They may also display reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-toincome ratios, or other criteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime\nloans are loans to borrowers displaying one or more of these characteristics at the time of origination or\npurchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than loans to prime borrowers. Generally, subprime\nborrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following:\nTwo or more 30-day delinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60-day delinquencies in the last 24\nmonths; Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months; Bankruptcy in the last 5\nyears; Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk score (FICO)\nof 660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an\nequivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or\notherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly debt-service\nrequirements from monthly income. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and is not meant to define\nspecific parameters for all subprime borrowers. Additionally, this definition may not match all market or\ninstitution specific subprime definitions, but should be viewed as a starting point from which the Agencies\nwill expand examination efforts.”\n5\n\nBased on historical experience, 70 percent or more of the securities were viewed as relatively safe and\ncould carry high investment-grade ratings. Often these higher quality securities were also repackaged into\nnew securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, making the risk tiering even less clear to the\ninvestor. If the ratings were accurate, highly rated securities containing subprime debt would have only a\nremote chance of default – similar to investment-grade securities containing prime mortgages, home equity\nloans, or student loans.\n6\n\nFinancing arrangements involving so-called auction-rate securities have experienced difficulties –\ninvestor interest in such securities waned as investors became concerned that insurers of debt might not\nhave sufficient financial capacity to meet all their obligations. In a similar vein the private student-loan\nmarket has found securitizations used to finance pools of student loans are more difficult, as investors avoid\nsecuritized financial instruments in general. And the commercial real estate market has been disrupted as\ninvestors have become reluctant to buy commercial-mortgage-backed securities.\n7\n\nIt should be noted that there was criticism of corporate ratings for a number of specific companies, such as\nEnron, earlier this decade.\n\n8\n\nMost firms that issue debt also have publicly traded equity. Equity analysts provide a variety of\nperspectives on a firm's prospects. In addition, investors often have access to default probabilities, known\nas KMV, or can observe credit default spreads to get another perspective on the accuracy of ratings. Also,\nfirm's equity and options can provide important evidence of how other investors perceive the company.\nFinally, there is a long history of the SEC enforcing disclosure rules to insure that investors have sufficient\ninformation about important corporate developments. With this plethora of corroborating data, investors\nhave a wide variety of indicators to help evaluate a firm's debt rating.\n\n9\n\nIn particular, those investors who are not well positioned to make independent credit evaluations should\nseek rated assets where the information costs for validating ratings are low.\n\n10\n\nThe recent declines in the highest-graded of some mortgage securities implies very significant losses, as\ninvestors would only take losses on these high-grade securities after all lower-graded securities had been\nwiped out.\n11\n\n“Auction rate securities were first offered for sale in U.S. financial markets in the early 1980s. As of the\nend of 2005, there were approximately $263 billion of auction rate securities outstanding. Many different\ntypes of issuers have issued auction rate securities – for example, closed-end funds, corporations, municipal\nauthorities and student loan organizations. Auction rate securities have generally been issued as either\nbonds or preferred stock and are designed to serve as money market-type instruments. They are purchased\n\n15\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nand sold, at established intervals, through an auction-type mechanism, but have long-term maturities, or no\nmaturity at all. In the auctions, auction rate securities are purchased and sold at par. Auction rate securities\nhave also been called ‘Auction Market Preferred Stock,’ ‘Variable Rate Preferred Securities,’ ‘Money\nMarket Preferred Securities’ and ‘Periodic Auction Rate Securities.’ The interest or dividend rate of an\nauction rate security is reset at these established intervals based on an auction in which investors who\nalready hold the security (called ‘holders’) and investors who seek to acquire the security (called\n‘prospective holders’) indicate their interest in continuing to hold, or in purchasing or selling, the security\nat rates that they specify to broker-dealers, such as Merrill Lynch, who have been appointed to participate\nin the auction. The dates on which the auctions take place (the ‘auction dates’), and the interval between the\nauction dates (the ‘auction period’), vary depending on the security. The auctions commonly are every\nseven days, twenty-eight days, thirty-five days or forty-nine days, but there are also some securities for\nwhich the auctions occur daily and others for which the auctions occur at longer intervals – for example,\nevery six months or once over a multi-year period.” Source: Merrill Lynch, “Description of Merrill\nLynch’s Auction Rate Securities Practices and Procedures” (http://www.ml.com/media/70501.pdf ).\n12\n\nAs noted in updates on credit and municipal market developments by Michael Holscher, David Jones,\nEric Stein, John McGowan, and Jason Miu of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n13\n\n“A structured investment vehicle or SIV is a limited-purpose operating company that undertakes\narbitrage activities by purchasing mostly highly rated medium- and long-term, fixed-income assets and\nfunding itself with cheaper, mostly short-term, highly rated CP and MTNs. While there are a number of\ncosts associated with running a structured investment vehicle, these are balanced by economic incentives:\nthe creation of net spread to pay subordinated noteholder returns and the creation of management fee\nincome. Vehicles sponsored by financial institutions also have the incentive to create off-balance-sheet\nfunds management structures with products that can be fed to existing and new clients by way of\ninvestment in the capital notes of the vehicle.” Source: Standard & Poor’s\n(http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.article_print/2,1,1,0,1031342466642.html ).\n\n14\n\nAnd enabled investors to evaluate whether pricing of their mortgage security was appropriate given the\npricing of similar products.\n15\n\nWhile making financial products more standard involves some trade-offs – less opportunity to provide\ninvestors a more customized product – such customized products involve some down-sides when accurate\npricing requires the particular security to trade hands in order to have confidence in its market price.\n16\n\nIn addition, an exchange can very significantly reduce counterparty risk by enforcing margin\nrequirements and other mechanism, to insure counterparties meets their contractual obligations. The creditdefault swap market has grown to the point where pricing and counterparty risk could be mitigated if more\ntransactions were exchange-traded.\n17\n\n“The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the federal government, insures private loans\nthat are issued for new and existing housing... Created by congress in 1934, the FHA became part of the\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Housing (HUD) in 1965. Today the mission of\nthe FHA includes helping borrowers get amounts they qualify for, and assisting lenders by reducing their\nrisk in issuing loans.” (Source: www.FHA.com)\n18\n\nThis is an approximation of FHA practice. The FHA would qualify the borrower at the FHA rate, not the\noriginal subprime rate, so we have used 45 percent rather than 41 percent of the back-end debt-to-income.\nActual credit standards may differ from the assumption used of never more than 60 days past due. Also,\nthe FHA lending limits are in the process of changing. However, given the changes in both the economy\nand housing prices, these factors may be more important in determining who qualifies in the future.\n\n16\n\n\fEMBARGOED until March 6, 2008,\n8:10 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n19\n\n“Reducing Preventable Mortgage Foreclosures” – March 4 speech at the Independent Community\nBankers of America Annual Convention, available at:\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080304a.htm.\n20\n\nThe Office of Thrift Supervision is one such party.\n\n21\n\nThe borrower would have a reduced loan balance and receive a prime rate, but would be obligated, upon\nselling, to share some of the future appreciation with the current lender and the FHA. Consider for\nexample a borrower with a loan of $110,000 and a value of the house of $100,000. The lender would write\noff $10,000 but would receive $100,000 when the loan was refinanced with FHA financing. The lender\nwould receive an option that gave the lender a share of any appreciated value in the house, for example\n20%. If the home was sold for $150,000, the lender would receive the $10,000 at time of sale. The FHA\nwould receive a share of the appreciated value in the house, for example 10%. If the home sold for\n$150,000 the FHA would receive $5000 at the time of sale. The borrower would avoid foreclosure, and\nstill receive 70% of the appreciation, or $35,000. The shared appreciation values could be designed as\ntransferable options that are recorded with the registry of deeds.\n\n17\n\n\fFigure 1\nMortgage Delinquency Rates by Loan Type\n1998:Q1 - 2007:Q3\n\nPercent Past Due 90 or More Days or in the Process of Foreclosure\n14\n12\n10\nSubprime\n8\n6\n4\nPrime\n\n2\n\nSource: Mortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey / Haver Analytics\n\n07:Q3\n\n07:Q1\n\n06:Q3\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q3\n\n05:Q1\n\n04:Q3\n\n04:Q1\n\n03:Q3\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q3\n\n02:Q1\n\n01:Q3\n\n01:Q1\n\n00:Q3\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q3\n\n99:Q1\n\n98:Q3\n\n98:Q1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 2\nSimplified Representation of a Mortgage-Backed\nSecurity’s Capital Structure\n100%\n\nMortgages\n\nAAA - 70%\n\nLower-Rated - 25%\n\n0%\n\nEquity - 5%\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 3\nThree-Month Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Yield,\nLIBOR, and the Federal Funds Target Rate\nJune 1, 2007 - February 29, 2008\n\nPercent\n3-Month Asset-Backed Commercial Paper\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\nFederal Funds Target\n3-Month LIBOR\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Board / Haver Analytics.\n\n22-Feb\n\n8-Feb\n\n25-Jan\n\n11-Jan\n\n28-Dec\n\n14-Dec\n\n30-Nov\n\n16-Nov\n\n2-Nov\n\n19-Oct\n\n5-Oct\n\n21-Sep\n\n7-Sep\n\n24-Aug\n\n10-Aug\n\n27-Jul\n\n13-Jul\n\n29-Jun\n\n15-Jun\n\n1-Jun\n\n2.0\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4\nCommercial and Industrial Loan Delinquency Rate at\nU.S. Commercial and Savings Banks\n1991:Q1 - 2007:Q4\n\nPercent of Outstandings\n1\n\n6.0\n\n0.9\n5.0\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n4.0\nC&I Loan Delinquency Rate\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.4\n2.0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n07:Q3\n\n06:Q4\n\n06:Q1\n\n05:Q2\n\n04:Q3\n\n03:Q4\n\n03:Q1\n\n02:Q2\n\n01:Q3\n\n00:Q4\n\n00:Q1\n\n99:Q2\n\n98:Q3\n\n97:Q4\n\n97:Q1\n\n96:Q2\n\n95:Q3\n\n94:Q4\n\n94:Q1\n\n93:Q2\n\n92:Q3\n\n91:Q4\n\n0\n91:Q1\n\n0.0\n\nRecession\n\nSource: Commercial and Savings Bank Call Reports.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 5\nKMV Sales-Weighted and Median\nExpected Default Frequency\nFebruary 2003 - January 2008\n\nPercent\n2.0\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\nSales-Weighted\n0.4\n\nNov-07\n\nAug-07\n\nMay-07\n\nFeb-07\n\nNov-06\n\nAug-06\n\nMay-06\n\nFeb-06\n\nNov-05\n\nAug-05\n\nFeb-05\n\nNov-04\n\nAug-04\n\nMay-04\n\nFeb-04\n\nNov-03\n\nAug-03\n\nMay-03\n\nFeb-03\n\nMay-05\n\nMedian\n\n0.0\n\nSource: Moody's KMV and author's calculations.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 6\nYield Spreads: Corporate Bonds vs. 10-Year Treasury\nJanuary 1998 - February 2008\n\nBasis Points\n700\n600\n500\n\n10-Year BBB US Industrials\n\n10-Year High-Yield US Industrials\n\n400\n300\n200\n100\n10-Year AAA US Industrials\nJan-2008\n\nJan-2007\n\nJan-2006\n\nJan-2005\n\nJan-2004\n\nJan-2003\n\nJan-2002\n\nJan-2001\n\nJan-2000\n\nJan-1999\n\nJan-1998\n\n0\n\nSource: S&P Global Fixed Income Research / Haver Analytics.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 7\nABX-HE 07-01 Tranches\nJanuary 2, 2007 - February 29, 2008.\n\nPrice\n120\n100\nBBB\n\n80\n60\n\nAAA\n\nBBB-\n\nAA\n\n40\nA\n20\n\nSource: Markit.\n\n26-Feb\n\n29-Jan\n\n1-Jan\n\n4-Dec\n\n6-Nov\n\n9-Oct\n\n11-Sep\n\n14-Aug\n\n17-Jul\n\n19-Jun\n\n22-May\n\n24-Apr\n\n27-Mar\n\n27-Feb\n\n30-Jan\n\n2-Jan\n\n0\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 8\nwww.MortgageReliefFund.com\n\n9\n\n\f",

            "content": "Discussion: The Mortgage Meltdown – Implications for Credit Availability\nEric S. Rosengren, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum, February 29, 2008\n\nI am very pleased to be able to discuss the paper \"Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the\nMortgage Meltdown” by Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap and Shin (GHKS).\nIt is somewhat ironic that several current participants on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), including myself, wrote extensively about the credit crunch period in the\nearly 1990s and now have the opportunity as policy makers to consider how financial problems\nmay be spilling over to the real economy.1 So it is particularly appropriate that the paper we are\ndiscussing today asks whether problems that originated in mortgage markets are likely to cause a\ncredit crunch that significantly impacts growth in the economy, and what that implies for central\nbanks.\nThe paper provides a variety of new facts about the current financial turmoil, and does a\nvery nice job of detailing the extent of current and potential problems that may impact future\npublic policy. I plan to first discuss the issue of the size of the losses to financial institutions\nstemming from the current financial turmoil. I will highlight both the uncertainty around the\nGHKS estimate, and the possible downside risk that may remain to their estimate. I will next\ndiscuss the issue of the impact on balance sheets. I will argue that to date, the balance sheet\nconstraints are primarily occurring at a few large institutions with significant exposure to more\ncomplicated financial products; but that again, there is downside risk that balance sheet\nconstraints could become more widespread in the future – particularly if housing prices\nexperience more significant declines. I will then amplify an issue touched on only lightly in the\n\n1\n\n\fpaper, and that is the implications of mortgage problems for securitization and complicated\nfinancial products. I will conclude with a few observations on policy.\n\nResidential Real Estate Losses – The Role of Declining Housing Prices\nGHKS use three different methods to determine mortgage credit losses. The first is a\nmigration analysis that looks at historical trends of each vintage year and then adjusts the trends\nfor falling home prices. The second extrapolates from the current pricing of mortgage-backed\nsecurities’ expected losses. The third uses foreclosure rates from previous regional periods of\nfalling housing prices, and applies those rates to the current distribution of mortgages. With\nseveral assumptions and caveats they find losses are expected to be $400 billion, with about half\nof that figure being borne by leveraged institutions.\nThe authors highlight the significant uncertainty around their estimates. This is\nparticularly appropriate since two critical components of the calculation, the path of housing\nprices and the path of the economy, are not directly estimated in the model. Analysis by Gerardi,\nShapiro, and Willen of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston2 finds the probability of a default\nand foreclosure is highly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment – particularly to house\nprice appreciation.\nIn making adjustments for falling housing prices, GHKS discuss house price declines of\n5, 10, and 15 percent from the end of 2006. While housing prices are critical to understanding\nthe extent of overall mortgage credit losses, the absence from the historical record of a sustained\nnational decline in housing prices makes it problematic to extrapolate the future solely with\nhistorical data. As shown in Table 1, all 10 major metropolitan areas followed by the CaseSchiller home-price index declined in the past year, and five of the major metropolitan areas\n\n2\n\n\fshow double-digit declines. These declines have occurred despite an unemployment rate in\nJanuary 2008 of 4.9 percent. Should the economy weaken more than expected, one can envision\ndownside risks to even the rather bleak forecast of GHKS – especially given the large number of\nhigh loan-to-value (LTV) loans made in the past three years.\nFrom a policy perspective it is important to understand not only what would happen if the\neconomy behaves as expected – which would currently be that we skirt a recession and housing\nprices show only modest declines – but also how significant the downside would be if the rise in\nthe unemployment rate and the decline in housing prices were significantly greater than currently\nexpected. The authors’ estimates of expected losses do not try to factor in the potential – though\nhopefully unlikely – outcome of housing prices interacting with sharper declines in employment\nand further financial difficulties at mortgage lenders. While not the most likely outcome, it is an\noutcome that policymakers and others may consider “taking out some insurance against.”\nAn additional factor left out of the analysis involves the nature of the housing recovery\nthat is likely to occur if the mortgage securities market and financial institutions are unwilling to\nlend to subprime borrowers. Given the recent difficulty in securitizing troubled or high LTV\nmortgage credits, and the possibility that many financial institutions will be reticent to lend to\nrisky borrowers in a declining house price market, the housing malaise could be more protracted\nand the recovery more anemic than we have experienced in previous housing downturns.\n\nBalance Sheet Constraints\nGHKS argue that the distribution of mortgage losses is important. Many of these losses\nare in leveraged financial institutions, which will be forced to shrink their balance sheets to\nmaintain desired capital ratios. Thus the analysis is in the spirit of earlier credit crunch literature\n\n3\n\n\fthat highlights that binding capital constraints at financial institutions can result in significant\nheadwinds, as experienced in the United States in the early 1990s and in Japan during the “lost\ndecade.”3\nTo date, there have been several significant differences in the distribution of losses\ncompared to the 1990s. The 1990s credit crunch resulted from regional losses in commercial\nreal estate and construction, and to a lesser degree residential investment. These losses\nessentially impacted all financial institutions in the affected region. To date in our current\nsituation, the mortgage problems have been concentrated in some of the largest financial\ninstitutions involved in structured finance and the securitization of subprime mortgages.\nIn fact, three large financial institutions alone have already announced almost $60 billion\nin write-downs in the last two quarters of 2007.4 Despite the very significant write-downs, the\nlosses have been mitigated by the ability of these global institutions to attract new capital. In fact\nthese same three institutions have together announced $36 billion in new capital in the last four\nmonths (October – January).5 This ability to raise new capital has helped mitigate capital\nconstraints.\nTable 2 shows that despite large financial losses announced by some commercial banks\nin the past two quarters, many banks have experienced increases in capital and in their capital\nratios. In fact, more than two-thirds of bank holding companies had increases in capital in the\nlast two quarters of 2007. Note, however, that the decreases are more prevalent among the\nlargest bank holding companies while the increases are more prevalent among the smaller bank\nholding companies. In terms of capital ratios, 354 bank holding companies had increases in\ncapital ratios in the last two quarters of 2007, while 592 had decreases. This reflects that even at\n\n4\n\n\fbank holding companies with increased capital, the asset growth has exceeded the capital\ngrowth.\nTable 3 shows that in aggregate, while capital was basically flat, assets did increase, as\nbanks provided liquidity to many firms and financial market participants. To date, the resulting\npotential capital constraints are concentrated in the largest banks with the largest exposure to\nsecurities tied to subprime mortgages. While some of the capital losses have been mitigated by\nnew capital, the losses in combination with involuntary growth in assets can potentially restrain\nthe willingness of these institutions to engage in activities that would further swell their balance\nsheet.\nBecause these institutions are actively engaged in structured products and loans to\nfinance leveraged deals, it is not surprising that participants in these markets are finding tighter\nfinancial constraints. For some markets where these banks are major market makers, the\nunwillingness to further increase balance sheets has impacted the liquidity in those markets.\nMany small and medium-sized businesses are not complaining about credit conditions.\nThis reflects the lack of exposure that many small and medium-sized banks had to securitized\nproducts or the subprime market. However, should housing prices continue to fall, losses in\nprime residential mortgages and construction loans are likely to cause these institutions to be\nmore capital constrained. Banks under $100 billion still retain significant exposure to residential\nmortgages and construction loans which account for 26 percent of assets or $750 billion. Should\nhousing prices continue to fall and the housing sector get worse, it is likely that these institutions\nwill begin being impacted more significantly.\n\n5\n\n\fSpillovers From the Mortgage Meltdown\nAn issue not directly addressed in this paper, but nonetheless critical to the discussion, is\nthe loss in confidence in the ratings process and the consequent uncertainty in the pricing of a\nwide variety of structured products.\nAs Exhibit 3.4 in GJKS highlights, AAA tranches for recently issued contracts are selling\nfor less than 70 percent of their par value. Since lower-grade tranches would experience losses\nfirst, such pricing implies very severe losses on the underlying assets. It also highlights that the\ndefault probabilities on a large number of highly-rated securities are likely to be higher than\nwould normally be expected by investors in the highest-grade securities. While the problems\nwith ratings accurately reflecting probabilities of default are primarily related to mortgage\nproducts, their impact has moved well beyond residential mortgages.\nThe largest banks have increasingly moved to an originate-to-distribute model for a\nvariety of assets formerly held on balance sheets. Leveraged loans, credit card receivables,\ncommercial real estate loans, student loans, and municipal borrowings have all increasingly been\nmoved off banks’ balance sheets and into a variety of new securities. As investors have lost faith\nin the ratings process, many of these highly-rated securities have begun to sell at significant\ndiscounts, which will likely result in additional losses.\nIn addition to the losses experienced by the holders of these securities, the borrowers\nhave had their financing disrupted. Many of these loans will need to be financed by bank\nbalance sheets, and the terms may be significantly different than what they experienced prior to\nthe recent financial turmoil.\nDifficulties in selling structured financial products have resulted in the disappearance or\nnear-disappearance of trading in some collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized\n\n6\n\n\fdebt obligations (CDOs), have disrupted the auction-rate securities market, have made it difficult\nto sell asset-backed commercial paper, have created problems for monoline insurers and have\ncaused the winding down of many structured investment vehicles. Many of these markets\nfinanced assets above and beyond mortgages, and as a result may produce losses not captured in\nthe analysis by GHKS. While problems in rating mortgages may have been the trigger, the\ndrying up of the market for structured financial products is a downside risk and could make it\nmore difficult or more expensive to meet the financing needs of a variety of organizations.\n\nPublic Policy\nGHKS express some pessimism regarding the ability of monetary policy to help mitigate\nproblems. I am less pessimistic. Most subprime loans had reset rates tied to the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) – generally around 6 percentage points over the six-month\nLIBOR. The reductions in the federal funds rate, as well as the reduction in the spread of\nLIBOR over the federal funds target after the introduction of the Federal Reserve’s Term\nAuction Facility, have significantly reduced the reset rate for most subprime borrowers (Figure\n1). For many borrowers, the reset rate may at this point not be dramatically different than the\noriginal rate – a significant difference from what would have occurred in the absence of\nappropriately aggressive monetary policy.\nIn addition, lower rates are likely to result in higher house prices than would occur in the\nabsence of monetary easing. This should reduce the foreclosure rate and reduce some of the\nconcern that housing problems will become more widespread. Finally, lower rates should result\nin less unemployment – one of the main drivers in forced sales of houses. Thus, monetary policy\nactions may significantly reduce the depth of problems, but are of course not a panacea.\n\n7\n\n\fMany of the possible steps to mitigate these problems involve policy solutions not tied to\nmonetary policy. In recent years the subprime market became the major avenue for low- and\nmoderate-income borrowers to buy homes. There would seem to be a strong economic incentive\nfor borrowers to seek FHA insurance and get a prime rather than a subprime rate. Examining\nhow FHA programs could continue to be modernized and streamlined and become a more viable\nchoice for borrowers may be an important mitigant for housing problems.\nGiven falling housing prices, many financial institutions are likely less willing to be\nexposed to the mortgage market. One aspect of the current situation is the high LTV ratios\nfacing many borrowers, as low down-payments and falling housing prices have made refinancing\nhomes difficult. A possible solution would be shared appreciation loans with FHA guarantees.\nThis approach, variants of which are currently being discussed, would provide the FHA and the\nlending institution with a portion of future appreciation in return for providing the FHA\ninsurance on high LTV loans.\nWhile too large a topic for today’s discussion, I believe there is also a need to increase\ntransparency and create more consistent prices for complex financial products. We need to think\nabout the ramifications and possible remedies of a situation where parties are unable to\naccurately value financial assets tied to the mortgage market – a market whose prices are more\neasily determined than are many other types of balance sheet assets.\n\nConclusion\nGHKS have done a nice job of highlighting some of the ramifications of the mortgage\nmeltdown. A critical factor in the size of losses, and whether balance sheet constraints become\nmore widespread, is the extent to which housing prices fall. Unfortunately, we have little\n\n8\n\n\fhistorical precedent for sustained declines in national housing prices, which makes it difficult to\nforecast future home prices. However, one of the significant downside risks to the economy is\nthat further declines in housing prices could depress residential investment, reduce consumer\nspending, generate elevated foreclosures, and contribute to financial instability. Taking\nappropriate monetary, regulatory, and fiscal actions to mitigate this risk seems prudent.\n\n1\n\nFor example, see the following.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe Seventeenth Annual\nVermont Economic Outlook Conference\nFriday, January 11, 2008\nBurlington, Vermont\n\nI would like to thank the organizers of this event for scheduling it after New Year’s Day,\nsince economists tend not to be particularly helpful for holiday cheer but quite useful when\nthinking of New Year’s resolutions. On your list of New Year’s resolutions, I would include not\nlistening to pundits who claimed:\n\n1) …that housing prices could not go down, nationally;\n2) …that triple-A ratings meant no default risk;\n3) …that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products.\n\nMy talk today will touch on all three, because I am going to discuss recent trends in residential\nreal estate, and their economic relevance. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday I am going to examine two prior periods of declining house prices – with some\nobservations on how they were addressed, the similarities and differences from our situation\ntoday, and the lessons we can draw. Throughout, I will refer to actions being pursued by a wide\nvariety of actors including the Federal Reserve, financial institutions, investors, borrowers, and\npolicymakers.\n\nRecent Trends in Residential Investment\nIn 2007, residential investment 2 was the laggard among the components of Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). Residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006,\nand has continued to decline in each quarter since. It seems all but certain that residential\ninvestment also declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 – and many economic forecasts expect\nresidential investment to continue to decline at least through the first half of 2008.\nHow should we interpret what could be nine or more continuous quarters of declining\nresidential investment? Exhibit 1 provides some initial context. Should the forecasts prove to be\nright, we will have experienced a longer string of back-to-back quarters of declining residential\ninvestment than at any other time in the past 50 years. 3, 4\nThat historical observation should focus our attention, but must also be tempered\nsomewhat by the unique aspects of our current situation. Let me be clear – this is an unusual\neconomic situation and we cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. For one thing, to date\nthis decline in residential investment has occurred in an economic environment of reasonably\nhealthy job and income growth, and low rates of unemployment – although the December Labor\nDepartment report, released last Friday, suggests less welcome developments, as the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nunemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December while non-farm payroll employment was\nessentially unchanged (an increase nationwide of 18,000). 5\nPrevious periods where residential investment declined for a year or more were either\naccompanied by, or closely followed by, an economic downturn. But history may or may not\nrepeat itself, because this period of prolonged weakness in housing is distinctive in several other\nways that add to uncertainty over its ultimate impact on the broader economy.\nFor one thing, most other periods of extended decline in residential investment were\npreceded by rising inflation rates, which in turn induced a policy response – usually in the form\nof a significant tightening of monetary policy (that is, increases in interest rates) [see Exhibit 2].\nHowever, the current period of weakness in housing has occurred despite a low inflation rate and\nlow real interest rates, by historical standards.\nAnother difference has been the national nature of the decline in housing prices.\nHistorically, housing prices have often shown sharp swings in particular states or regions, but it\nwas unusual for prices to fall nationwide.\nThrough the 1980s there were a series of rolling regional downturns that resulted in big\nfluctuations in regional housing prices. These were generally due to significant regional\neconomic factors, such as the surge in oil prices in the late 1970s that disproportionately boosted\nthe southwestern portion of the country. When oil prices then fell by nearly half in the early\n1980s, this same region experienced sharp drops in home prices. Similarly, the northeast’s\nhouse-price cycle of the 1980s and early 1990s was a regional phenomenon, as the promise of a\nnew technology-based “economic miracle” proved too good to be true.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn these earlier episodes, housing finance was still dominated by local financial\ninstitutions; and house price declines were regional, not national, and were not particularly well\nsynchronized with national recessions.\nThe regional nature of these housing problems is illustrated in Exhibit 3, which plots\nchanges in real estate prices by census region. Movements of housing prices in various regions\nduring the 1980s – shown on the far left side of the chart – were not particularly correlated.\nHousing prices in some regions went up despite significant declines in other regions. The\nOFHEO national house price index did not decline, giving some analysts a false sense of\nconfidence that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate loans would perform at least\nreasonably well, since real estate prices were dominated by local effects.\nThen, over the 1990s, there was less regional variation in housing price appreciation and\nmore of a common trend, which has become more pronounced recently. Greater correlation of\nhousing price increases and decreases across regions of the country meant that the diversification\nbenefit resulting from holding a national portfolio of real estate loans was significantly less than\nhistory would imply.\nWith housing price changes more correlated across regions, mortgage securities and\nderivatives of mortgage securities behaved differently than many investors had assumed they\nwould. The Boston Fed’s research 6 shows that, in large part due to widespread house-price\ndeclines, foreclosures have risen sharply in much of the country – not just in regional pockets.\nMany of the investment products consisting of securitized mortgages assumed more favorable\nhouse-price trends, so many that carried triple-A ratings have been downgraded to below\ninvestment grade – or are trading as if they were downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn part, the trend towards securitizing mortgage loans allowed the financing arrangements\nto be driven by national rather than regional conditions. As long as investor demand for higheryielding mortgage securities and derivatives was strong, there was little of the natural “governor”\nthat occurs when financial institutions become unduly concentrated in particular regions or asset\nclasses. This change enabled the supply of financing, particularly to riskier borrowers, to expand\nrapidly in all regions of the country.\nExhibit 4 illustrates how abruptly the pattern in house prices has changed. The home\nprice indexes generated by both the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight\n(OFHEO) 7 and S&P/Case-Shiller 8 show that home prices that accelerated during the first half of\nthe decade have been quickly reversing that trend.\nAs of the close of the third quarter, the S&P/Case-Shiller index indicates that house\nprices are down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite 10 monthly\nindex, representing the average of 10 large metropolitan areas, provides more recent data and has\ndeclined by 6.7 percent over the last year. 9 This is the largest decline in the 21-year history of\nthe index.\nThere has also been significant variation across metropolitan areas, illustrated in Exhibit\n5. The largest decline among the 10 metro areas was in Miami, where prices have declined by\n12.4 percent over the past year, while Denver’s decline was just 1.8 percent.\nWhile real estate has not generally experienced the volatility of many financial\ninstruments, large regional price declines over a relatively short period of time can, and have,\noccurred. And if regional price declines are becoming more tightly correlated, as some of this\nsuggests, a more significant national house price decline cannot be ruled out.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe sharp declines experienced in many regions of the country have occurred despite low\nreal interest rates and, until December, an unemployment rate below 5 percent. This highlights a\nrisk to the housing sector going forward: Since prices have declined substantially even in a\nrelatively benign economic environment, one cannot discount the possibility that they could fall\nmore rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008.\n\nThe Real Effects of Housing Price Declines\nWhile the outlook for housing will be greatly affected by the economy, history indicates\nthat “institutional” factors can also play an important role. It is instructive to compare our\ncurrent situation with earlier episodes of falling housing prices. Two very different scenarios,\nand outcomes, are illustrated by experiences in New England and Japan.\nTo give you a peek at the punch line, let me mention up front what I think the broadest\nlessons are:\n First, that transparency matters, and is generally beneficial;\n Second, that prompt recognition of losses leads to a more efficient outcome – if\nsomewhat more pain in the short run;\n Third, that adjustments are easier in an orderly economic environment with a wellfunctioning financial system. This is something the Federal Reserve is working to\nhelp ensure.\n\nNew England’s Experience\nExhibit 6 illustrates the significant decline in house prices that occurred in New England\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast to the current period, many of those loans were\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nheld by local financial institutions. As prospects for the New England economy boomed in the\nmid to late 1980s, these financial institutions significantly increased their portfolio of\nconstruction, residential, and commercial real estate loans.\nFinancial institutions were regionally based, so they were highly susceptible to regional\nshocks. When the New England economy subsequently faltered, the real estate market\ncollapsed. Prices on both residential and commercial real estate declined, resulting in losses to\nbanks’ loan portfolios. Many financial institutions found that they were inadequately diversified\nand had inadequate capital to absorb losses.\nThe supervisory process forced banks to recognize these losses. A key component of the\nbank examiner’s job is to insure that problem loans are appropriately recognized on bank balance\nsheets. Accordingly, banks were forced to write down the value of real estate loans to reflect\ndeclines in the value of the underlying collateral, and the reduced ability of borrowers to service\ntheir loans. In fact, very large declines in bank assets frequently occurred at the time of bank\nexaminations. 10\nThe large losses sustained by banks in that era resulted in 115 banks failing. 11 The\ncombination of failed banks and significant losses at surviving banks limited the supply of credit\nto bank-dependent borrowers, many of whom were engaged in businesses not directly related to\nreal estate. Many of the problem loans ended up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), which expedited the necessary adjustment process by quickly disposing of\nthe collateral property.\nThe prompt action of the bank examiners and the FDIC was, and remains, controversial.\nThe swiftness of the write-downs and disposal of troubled assets initially aggravated the decline\nin residential and commercial prices. But it also meant that prices fell to the point that many\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninvestors became convinced that subsequent capital gains were inevitable. Thus, while the\ndecline in prices was steep, the duration of the problem was probably shortened by aggressive\nand transparent actions. Within four years of the trough, housing prices had already returned to\ntheir previous peak.\n\nJapan’s Experience\nOne can think of the New England experience, and the swift action of examiners, as one\nend of a continuum. At the other end is the experience in Japan. As the 1990s began, stock\nprices and real estate prices peaked. While stock prices fell relatively quickly, real estate prices\ndeclined much more gradually.\nKeenly aware of the credit-crunch experienced in the United States, Japanese regulators\nchose to move slowly in forcing write-downs of problem assets. In fact, in the early 1990s there\nwas relatively little official information published on the extent of problems. To prevent writedowns, problem assets were not revealed publicly. This lack of transparency and disclosure\nmade many investors and counterparties wary of Japanese financial institutions, as the magnitude\nof problems was difficult to discern. In addition, financial institutions and the government\naccumulated problem assets, which they held rather than disposing of the assets at “distress”\nprices.\nWhile reported prices in real estate declined slowly, volume was limited by investors’\nconcerns that the large pool of problem assets would eventually need to be sold in the market.\nWhile bank lending did not decline abruptly, several studies have indicated that lending was\nquite inefficient – often used to prop up distressed borrowers rather than to allocate credit in the\neconomy more efficiently. 12\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe overall result was that real estate prices declined for over a decade [see Exhibit 7].\nMirroring the gradual decline in prices, the recovery in prices was similarly very slow. The\neconomy experienced subpar growth for an extended period of time.\n\nWhile our current period is different in many ways from the New England and Japan\nexperiences with declining real estate prices, there are lessons to be drawn.\nFor one, the degree of transparency in financial statements can significantly affect\nconfidence in financial institutions. Uncertainty about asset values may ultimately be worse than\nlosses.\nIn the past cases of New England and Japan, and today as well, there are concerns about\nthe value of the underlying assets complicating matters. In New England the problem\nmanifested itself because real estate, especially commercial real estate, changes hands relatively\ninfrequently – particularly in a slump – and thus is difficult to value. The slow recovery of\nJapanese financial institutions was in part related to significant concerns about their true\nfinancial condition, as many of the assets held by banks in Japan were loans to finance assets\nwhich changed hands relatively infrequently. The complex, opaque nature of many of today's\nmortgage-derivative instruments also makes them very difficult to value, which in turn makes\nthem relatively illiquid.\nHistory suggests it is at such times that enhanced transparency can help clarify the extent\nof the problems, and allow financial market participants to determine appropriate valuations for\nassets and whether valuation methods are being conservatively applied. I am hopeful that the\nmanagement of firms with large exposures to securitized subprime mortgages will embrace more\ndetailed disclosures that allow for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the problems.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nFinancial institutions with poor transparency are likely to have greater difficulty raising external\nfunds at favorable prices; and indeed, we have seen significant tiering along these lines in the\nfederal funds market and other credit markets.\nLooking at the New England and Japan experiences, let me be clear that I am not\nadvocating responses to today’s problems that are at either extreme of the continuum. But\ncertainly we can learn what not to do from Japan’s experience. Clearly it is better to take care of\nproblems now than distort and greatly prolong the needed adjustment process.\nAlong with greater transparency, the New England experience reminds us that a full\nrecognition of losses will create incentives for firms to dispose of bad assets. However, we face\nan added challenge today. When problem loans were held in commercial banks, much of the\nloss recognition was enforced through the bank-examination process. With today’s opaque\nfinancial products held in a variety of financial intermediaries – not just traditional commercial\nbanks, and located both in the U.S. and abroad – the loss recognition is not likely to be\nconsistently enforced.\nMaintaining confidence in financial institutions and financial markets is key to a quick\nrecovery from a crisis. Falling real estate prices caused a credit crunch during the early 1990s\nNew England downturn, as banks reduced lending to borrowers in general as a result of the\nbanks’ capital-adequacy problems. In Japan, problem real estate loans caused banks to\nmisallocate credit to inefficient projects to prevent recognition of their problems. However, in\ntoday’s situation we are fortunate that most financial institutions have entered the current\nproblems with significant capital cushions and that many U.S. financial institutions are moving\nto proactively address the problems.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nHowever, the potential for a credit crunch remains. Commercial banks are still an\nimportant source of liquidity and there are troubling developments at work. Allow me to delve\nfor a moment into banking finance to make this point.\nMany commercial banks participated in the subprime market by sponsoring off-balance\nsheet investment vehicles. These vehicles were financed by short term commercial paper. In\nmany cases, subprime loans were only a small fraction of the asset holdings of these vehicles.\nHowever, investors are very leery of anything associated with subprime loans and are reluctant\nto buy the commercial paper of these vehicles.\nFor both reputational and legal reasons, some of the sponsoring banks are now moving\nthese off-balance sheet instruments onto their balance sheets, funding them as part of the bank\nportfolio. As shown in Exhibit 8, bank assets have grown significantly since the financial\nturmoil emerged in July. However, banks have capital requirements that limit their ability to\nexpand. Thus, there is a risk that this unintended growth in bank assets will squeeze out loans to\nother borrowers.\n\nRisk Mitigation by the Federal Reserve\nIn the midst of this recent financial turmoil, I am hopeful that actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve will reduce the potential negative impact.\nMy view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of\na more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling housing prices further weaken the\nincentives for residential investment, but are also likely to dampen consumer and business\nconfidence and spending. Furthermore, falling house prices roil financial markets and financial\ninstitutions by exacerbating exposures to the housing market.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the Federal Reserve can minimize the severity and\nspillover of housing and associated weakness by implementing policies that foster a sound\nmacroeconomic environment, low and stable inflation rates and a well-functioning financial\nsystems. In that regard, the Fed has reduced its key policy rate by 100 basis points over the past\nfive months.\nAlso, in an effort to help return markets to more normal short-term funding patterns, the\nFederal Reserve has initiated a new Term Auction Facility or TAF. The TAF enables banks with\nilliquid collateral to borrow from the discount window at a price determined by an open auction.\nThis innovative tool has the potential to provide greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to\nrespond to the sort of liquidity problems that we have seen in recent months. The benefit to\nbanks is that they can borrow relatively low-cost funds using assets that are temporarily illiquid\nas collateral. This facility is particularly useful in providing term lending, and appears to have\nbeen helpful as financial institutions sought liquidity at the end of 2007.\nThe first two auctions have provided term funding at a rate above the overnight federal\nfunds rate but below the primary credit rate that banks borrow from the Fed’s Discount Window.\nAn added benefit of the TAF is that it allows the Fed to supply funds to the market without\nadding to stresses in Treasury markets by engaging in direct purchases of Treasury securities.\nTreasury markets have experienced significant stress in recent months, as Treasury issues were\nin great demand by investors around the world who sought safe, liquid assets. 13\n\nOn a more regional note, the New England states have seen a falloff in housing\nconstruction and home sales roughly comparable to that of the nation. Housing prices, which\ngrew very rapidly from 1998 to 2005, have leveled off and in three New England states –\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire – prices are down from a year ago. 14 While\nVermont's experience is more favorable than that of the other New England states, the picture is\nbroadly similar.\nAs housing prices have leveled off or declined in New England, foreclosure rates have\nrisen from well below the national average to the national average, which is also rising. Again,\nVermont's experience is more favorable than the rest of New England: Its foreclosure rates as of\nthe third quarter of last year were only half the national and the regional averages.\nThe increase in foreclosures has been particularly sharp for subprime adjustable rate\nmortgages. The typical subprime adjustable rate mortgage is a hybrid, with a fixed rate of about\n8 percent for two years that resets to about 11 percent. The surge in foreclosures thus far is not\ndue to resets. However, many borrowers holding subprime loans face resets in the coming year,\nindeed the next few quarters. This prospect threatens to make a difficult situation even worse.\nSo I am very pleased that five large New England banks have formed a consortium to\nreach out to subprime borrowers to see whether they might be candidates for loans at prime rates,\nmaking use of existing federal and state insurance programs. This initiative, called the Mortgage\nRelief Fund, was launched shortly before Christmas with a $125 million commitment from the\nfive banks and has already has some success in generating inquiries. Exhibit 9 is an excerpt from\nthe effort's web site.\nTo date the banks – Bank of America, Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth,\nand Webster Bank – have had over 430 calls from borrowers, and a number of them are\nbeginning the application process or have already submitted loan applications. Because\nborrowers can qualify for government-insured loan programs with as little as 3 percent equity in\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nthe house, this is an important initiative for borrowers to consider if they are currently holding\nsubprime loans.\nThe challenge, really, is getting the word out and convincing borrowers who may face\ntrouble in coming months that it is in their best interest to act now.\nSo I strongly encourage homeowners paying a high subprime rate, and possibly facing a\nrate-reset to an even higher level, to visit the website – www.MortgageReliefFund.com – to\nbegin exploring whether they would be better off financially by taking advantage of this\nprogram.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is pleased to be working with the five banks on the\nMortgage Relief Fund initiative and commends them for their efforts.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and by way of recap, the weakness in the housing sector has slowed\neconomic growth in the overall economy. The collateral effects of the residential slowdown are\nlikely to be significantly affected by the path of housing prices and, importantly, how a wide\nvariety of financial intermediaries react to the current and future problems. I have offered a few\nthoughts, gleaned from history, on how I hope financial intermediaries and others will react. In\naddition, I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts\nto date — actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 11, 2008,\n1PM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nGDP is essentially the value of goods and services put in place during a time period. Residential investment is the\nhousing component of GDP. “The main indicator of the quantity of new housing supplied to the economy is the\nresidential fixed investment series from the national income and product accounts. Residential investment is made\nup of new construction put in place, expenditures on maintenance and home improvement, equipment purchased for\nuse in residential structures (e.g., washers and dryers purchased by landlords and rented out to tenants), and\nbrokerage commissions.” (Source: “Residential Investment over the Real Estate Cycle” by John Krainer, in the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Letter #2006-15; June 30, 2006). \"Brokers’ commissions…are\npart of the cost of acquiring a house and, therefore, a capital expenditure.\" (Source: \"National and Regional\nHousing Patterns\" by Lynn Elaine Browne in the New England Economic Review, July/August 2000, published by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston).\n\n3\n\nNotably, there were 11 consecutive quarters of decline ending in 1958.\n\n4\n\nThis is not to suggest that the current downturn in residential investment is unprecedented in its severity.\nDownturns that extended from 1978 to 1982 and from 1987 to 1991 were longer but were interrupted by some “up”\nquarters. Also, the 1973-75 downturn in residential investment was arguably shortened by fiscal stimulus (large tax\nrebates) in the second quarter of 1975.\n\n5\n\nThe December Employment Situation report released January 4 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor went on to say that “Job growth in several service-providing industries, including professional\nand technical services, health care, and food services, was largely offset by job losses in construction and\nmanufacturing. Average hourly earnings rose by 7 cents, or 0.4 percent.”\n\n6\n\n“Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures” by Kristopher Gerardi,\nAdam Hale Shapiro, and Paul S.

The\nHPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings\non the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family\nproperties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.”\n(Source: OFHEO website – www.ofheo.gov)\n8\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller® Home Price Indices “measures the residential housing market, tracking changes in the\nvalue of the residential real estate market in 20 metropolitan regions across the United States. These indices use the\nrepeat sales pricing technique to measure housing markets.

When housing prices were rising\nrapidly in New England, the number of foreclosures initiated was very low – considerably lower, as a fraction of\nloans outstanding, than nationally.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nConnecticut Business and Industry Association’s\n2008 Economic Summit and Outlook\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 8, 2008\n\nI would like to thank the CBIA for organizing this event and for scheduling it after New\nYear’s Day, since economists tend not to be particularly helpful for holiday cheer but quite\nuseful when thinking of New Year’s resolutions. On your list of New Year’s resolutions, I\nwould include not listening to pundits who claimed:\n\n1) …that housing prices could not go down, nationally;\n2) …that triple-A ratings meant no default risk;\n3) …that calculating fair market value was easy for mortgage products.\n\nMy talk today will touch on all three, because I am going to discuss recent trends in residential\nreal estate, and their economic relevance. 1\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nToday I am going to examine two prior periods of declining house prices – with some\nobservations on how they were addressed, the similarities and differences from our situation\ntoday, and the lessons we can draw. Throughout, I will refer to actions being pursued by a wide\nvariety of actors including the Federal Reserve, financial institutions, investors, borrowers, and\npolicymakers.\n\nRecent Trends in Residential Investment\nIn 2007, residential investment was the laggard among the components of Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). Residential investment began declining in the first quarter of 2006,\nand has continued to decline in each quarter since. It seems all but certain that residential\ninvestment also declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 – and many economic forecasts expect\nresidential investment to continue to decline at least through the first half of 2008.\nHow should we interpret what could be nine or more continuous quarters of declining\nresidential investment? Exhibit 1 provides some initial context. Should the forecasts prove to be\nright, we will have experienced a longer string of back-to-back quarters of declining residential\ninvestment than at any other time in the past 50 years. 2, 3\nThat historical observation should focus our attention, but must also be tempered\nsomewhat by the unique aspects of our current situation. Let me be clear – this is an unusual\neconomic situation and we cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. For one thing, to date\nthis decline in residential investment has occurred in an economic environment of reasonably\nhealthy job and income growth, and low rates of unemployment – although the December Labor\nDepartment report, released last Friday, suggests less welcome developments, as the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nunemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December while non-farm payroll employment was\nessentially unchanged (an increase nationwide of 18,000). 4\nPrevious periods where residential investment declined for a year or more were either\naccompanied by, or closely followed by, an economic downturn. But history may or may not\nrepeat itself, because this period of prolonged weakness in housing is distinctive in several other\nways that add to uncertainty over its ultimate impact on the broader economy.\nFor one thing, most other periods of extended decline in residential investment were\npreceded by rising inflation rates, which in turn induced a policy response – usually in the form\nof a significant tightening of monetary policy (that is, increases in interest rates) [see Exhibit 2].\nHowever, the current period of weakness in housing has occurred despite a low inflation rate and\nlow real interest rates, by historical standards.\nAnother difference has been the national nature of the decline in housing prices.\nHistorically, housing prices have often shown sharp swings in particular states or regions, but it\nwas unusual for prices to fall nationwide.\nThrough the 1980s there were a series of rolling regional downturns that resulted in big\nfluctuations in regional housing prices. These were generally due to significant regional\neconomic factors, such as the surge in oil prices in the late 1970s that disproportionately boosted\nthe southwestern portion of the country. When oil prices then fell by nearly half in the early\n1980s, this same region experienced sharp drops in home prices. Similarly, the northeast’s\nhouse-price cycle of the 1980s and early 1990s was a regional phenomenon, as the promise of a\nnew technology-based “economic miracle” proved too good to be true.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn these earlier episodes, housing finance was still dominated by local financial\ninstitutions; and house price declines were regional, not national, and were not particularly well\nsynchronized with national recessions.\nThe regional nature of these housing problems is illustrated in Exhibit 3, which plots\nchanges in real estate prices by census region. Movements of housing prices in various regions\nduring the 1980s – shown on the far left side of the chart – were not particularly correlated.\nHousing prices in some regions went up despite significant declines in other regions. The\nOFHEO national house price index did not decline, giving some analysts a false sense of\nconfidence that a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate loans would perform at least\nreasonably well, since real estate prices were dominated by local effects.\nThen, over the 1990s, there was less regional variation in housing price appreciation and\nmore of a common trend, which has become more pronounced recently. Greater correlation of\nhousing price increases and decreases across regions of the country meant that the diversification\nbenefit resulting from holding a national portfolio of real estate loans was significantly less than\nhistory would imply.\nWith housing price changes more correlated across regions, mortgage securities and\nderivatives of mortgage securities behaved differently than many investors had assumed they\nwould. The Boston Fed’s research 5 shows that, in large part due to widespread house-price\ndeclines, foreclosures have risen sharply in much of the country – not just in regional pockets.\nMany of the investment products consisting of securitized mortgages assumed more favorable\nhouse-price trends, so many that carried triple-A ratings have been downgraded to below\ninvestment grade – or are trading as if they were downgraded to below investment grade.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nIn part, the trend towards securitizing mortgage loans allowed the financing arrangements\nto be driven by national rather than regional conditions. As long as investor demand for higheryielding mortgage securities and derivatives was strong, there was little of the natural “governor”\nthat occurs when financial institutions become unduly concentrated in particular regions or asset\nclasses. This change enabled the supply of financing, particularly to riskier borrowers, to expand\nrapidly in all regions of the country.\nExhibit 4 illustrates how abruptly the pattern in house prices has changed. The home\nprice indexes generated by both the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight\n(OFHEO) 6 and S&P/Case-Shiller 7 show that home prices that accelerated during the first half of\nthe decade have been quickly reversing that trend.\nAs of the close of the third quarter, the S&P/Case-Shiller index indicates that house\nprices are down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite 10 monthly\nindex, representing the average of 10 large metropolitan areas, provides more recent data and has\ndeclined by 6.7 percent over the last year. 8 This is the largest decline in the 21-year history of\nthe index.\nThere has also been significant variation across metropolitan areas, illustrated in Exhibit\n5. The largest decline among the 10 metro areas was in Miami, where prices have declined by\n12.4 percent over the past year, while Denver’s decline was just 1.8 percent.\nWhile real estate has not generally experienced the volatility of many financial\ninstruments, large regional price declines over a relatively short period of time can, and have,\noccurred. And if regional price declines are becoming more tightly correlated, as some of this\nsuggests, a more significant national house price decline cannot be ruled out.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe sharp declines experienced in many regions of the country have occurred despite low\nreal interest rates and, until December, an unemployment rate below 5 percent. This highlights a\nrisk to the housing sector going forward: Since prices have declined substantially even in a\nrelatively benign economic environment, one cannot discount the possibility that they could fall\nmore rapidly should economic performance not remain strong in 2008.\n\nThe Real Effects of Housing Price Declines\nWhile the outlook for housing will be greatly affected by the economy, history indicates\nthat “institutional” factors can also play an important role. It is instructive to compare our\ncurrent situation with earlier episodes of falling housing prices. Two very different scenarios,\nand outcomes, are illustrated by experiences in New England and Japan.\nTo give you a peek at the punch line, let me mention up front what I think the broadest\nlessons are:\n First, that transparency matters, and is generally beneficial;\n Second, that prompt recognition of losses leads to a more efficient outcome – if\nsomewhat more pain in the short run;\n Third, that adjustments are easier in an orderly economic environment with a wellfunctioning financial system. This is something the Federal Reserve is working to\nhelp ensure.\n\nNew England’s Experience\nExhibit 6 illustrates the significant decline in house prices that occurred in New England\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast to the current period, many of those loans were\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nheld by local financial institutions. As prospects for the New England economy boomed in the\nmid to late 1980s, these financial institutions significantly increased their portfolio of\nconstruction, residential, and commercial real estate loans.\nFinancial institutions were regionally based, so they were highly susceptible to regional\nshocks. When the New England economy subsequently faltered, the real estate market\ncollapsed. Prices on both residential and commercial real estate declined, resulting in losses to\nbanks’ loan portfolios. Many financial institutions found that they were inadequately diversified\nand had inadequate capital to absorb losses.\nThe supervisory process forced banks to recognize these losses. A key component of the\nbank examiner’s job is to insure that problem loans are appropriately recognized on bank balance\nsheets. Accordingly, banks were forced to write down the value of real estate loans to reflect\ndeclines in the value of the underlying collateral, and the reduced ability of borrowers to service\ntheir loans. In fact, very large declines in bank assets frequently occurred at the time of bank\nexaminations. 9\nThe large losses sustained by banks in that era resulted in 115 banks failing. 10 The\ncombination of failed banks and significant losses at surviving banks limited the supply of credit\nto bank-dependent borrowers, many of whom were engaged in businesses not directly related to\nreal estate. Many of the problem loans ended up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), which expedited the necessary adjustment process by quickly disposing of\nthe collateral property.\nThe prompt action of the bank examiners and the FDIC was, and remains, controversial.\nThe swiftness of the write-downs and disposal of troubled assets initially aggravated the decline\nin residential and commercial prices. But it also meant that prices fell to the point that many\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\ninvestors became convinced that subsequent capital gains were inevitable. Thus, while the\ndecline in prices was steep, the duration of the problem was probably shortened by aggressive\nand transparent actions. Within four years of the trough, housing prices had already returned to\ntheir previous peak.\n\nJapan’s Experience\nOne can think of the New England experience, and the swift action of examiners, as one\nend of a continuum. At the other end is the experience in Japan. As the 1990s began, stock\nprices and real estate prices peaked. While stock prices fell relatively quickly, real estate prices\ndeclined much more gradually.\nKeenly aware of the credit-crunch experienced in the United States, Japanese regulators\nchose to move slowly in forcing write-downs of problem assets. In fact, in the early 1990s there\nwas relatively little official information published on the extent of problems. To prevent writedowns, problem assets were not revealed publicly. This lack of transparency and disclosure\nmade many investors and counterparties wary of Japanese financial institutions, as the magnitude\nof problems was difficult to discern. In addition, financial institutions and the government\naccumulated problem assets, which they held rather than disposing of the assets at “distress”\nprices.\nWhile reported prices in real estate declined slowly, volume was limited by investors’\nconcerns that the large pool of problem assets would eventually need to be sold in the market.\nWhile bank lending did not decline abruptly, several studies have indicated that lending was\nquite inefficient – often used to prop up distressed borrowers rather than to allocate credit in the\neconomy more efficiently. 11\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe overall result was that real estate prices declined for over a decade [see Exhibit 7].\nMirroring the gradual decline in prices, the recovery in prices was similarly very slow. The\neconomy experienced subpar growth for an extended period of time.\nWhile our current period is different in many ways from the New England and Japan\nexperiences with declining real estate prices, there are lessons to be drawn.\nFor one, the degree of transparency in financial statements can significantly affect\nconfidence in financial institutions. Uncertainty about asset values may ultimately be worse than\nlosses.\nIn the past cases of New England and Japan, and today as well, there are concerns about\nthe value of the underlying assets complicating matters. In New England the problem\nmanifested itself because real estate, especially commercial real estate, changes hands relatively\ninfrequently – particularly in a slump – and thus is difficult to value. The slow recovery of\nJapanese financial institutions was in part related to significant concerns about their true\nfinancial condition, as many of the assets held by banks in Japan were loans to finance assets\nwhich changed hands relatively infrequently. The complex, opaque nature of many of today's\nmortgage-derivative instruments also makes them very difficult to value, which in turn makes\nthem relatively illiquid.\nHistory suggests it is at such times that enhanced transparency can help clarify the extent\nof the problems, and allow financial market participants to determine appropriate valuations for\nassets and whether valuation methods are being conservatively applied. I am hopeful that the\nmanagement of firms with large exposures to securitized subprime mortgages will embrace more\ndetailed disclosures that allow for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the problems.\nFinancial institutions with poor transparency are likely to have greater difficulty raising external\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nfunds at favorable prices; and indeed, we have seen significant tiering along these lines in the\nfederal funds market and other credit markets.\nLooking at the New England and Japan experiences, let me be clear that I am not\nadvocating responses to today’s problems that are at either extreme of the continuum. But\ncertainly we can learn what not to do from Japan’s experience. Clearly it is better to take care of\nproblems now than distort and greatly prolong the needed adjustment process.\nAlong with greater transparency, the New England experience reminds us that a full\nrecognition of losses will create incentives for firms to dispose of bad assets. However, we face\nan added challenge today. When problem loans were held in commercial banks, much of the\nloss recognition was enforced through the bank-examination process. With today’s opaque\nfinancial products held in a variety of financial intermediaries – not just traditional commercial\nbanks, and located both in the U.S. and abroad – the loss recognition is not likely to be\nconsistently enforced.\nMaintaining confidence in financial institutions and financial markets is key to a quick\nrecovery from a crisis. Falling real estate prices caused a credit crunch during the early 1990s\nNew England downturn, as banks reduced lending to borrowers in general as a result of the\nbanks’ capital-adequacy problems. In Japan, problem real estate loans caused banks to\nmisallocate credit to inefficient projects to prevent recognition of their problems. However, in\ntoday’s situation we are fortunate that most financial institutions have entered the current\nproblems with significant capital cushions and that many U.S. financial institutions are moving\nto proactively address the problems.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nHowever, the potential for a credit crunch remains. Commercial banks are still an\nimportant source of liquidity and there are troubling developments at work. Allow me to delve\nfor a moment into banking finance to make this point.\nMany commercial banks participated in the subprime market by sponsoring off-balance\nsheet investment vehicles. These vehicles were financed by short term commercial paper. In\nmany cases, subprime loans were only a small fraction of the asset holdings of these vehicles.\nHowever, investors are very leery of anything associated with subprime loans and are reluctant\nto buy the commercial paper of these vehicles.\nFor both reputational and legal reasons, some of the sponsoring banks are now moving\nthese off-balance sheet instruments onto their balance sheets, funding them as part of the bank\nportfolio. As shown in Exhibit 8, bank assets have grown significantly since the financial\nturmoil emerged in July. However, banks have capital requirements that limit their ability to\nexpand. Thus, there is a risk that this unintended growth in bank assets will squeeze out loans to\nother borrowers.\n\nRisk Mitigation by the Federal Reserve\nIn the midst of this recent financial turmoil, I am hopeful that actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve will reduce the potential negative impact.\nMy view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of\na more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling housing prices further weaken the\nincentives for residential investment, but are also likely to dampen consumer and business\nconfidence and spending. Furthermore, falling house prices roil financial markets and financial\ninstitutions by exacerbating exposures to the housing market.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the Federal Reserve can minimize the severity and\nspillover of housing and associated weakness by implementing policies that foster a sound\nmacroeconomic environment, low and stable inflation rates and a well-functioning financial\nsystems. In that regard, the Fed has reduced its key policy rate by 100 basis points over the past\nfive months.\nAlso, in an effort to help return markets to more normal short-term funding patterns, the\nFederal Reserve has initiated a new Term Auction Facility or TAF. The TAF enables banks with\nilliquid collateral to borrow from the discount window at a price determined by an open auction.\nThis innovative tool has the potential to provide greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to\nrespond to the sort of liquidity problems that we have seen in recent months. The benefit to\nbanks is that they can borrow relatively low-cost funds using assets that are temporarily illiquid\nas collateral. This facility is particularly useful in providing term lending, and appears to have\nbeen helpful as financial institutions sought liquidity at the end of 2007.\nThe first two auctions have provided term funding at a rate above the overnight federal\nfunds rate but below the primary credit rate that banks borrow from the Fed’s Discount Window.\nAn added benefit of the TAF is that it allows the Fed to supply funds to the market without\nadding to stresses in Treasury markets by engaging in direct purchases of Treasury securities.\nTreasury markets have experienced significant stress in recent months, as Treasury issues were\nin great demand by investors around the world who sought safe, liquid assets. 12\n\nOn a more regional note, the New England states have seen a falloff in housing\nconstruction and home sales roughly comparable to that of the nation. Housing prices, which\ngrew very rapidly from 1998 to 2005, have leveled off and in three New England states –\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire – prices are down from a year ago. 13 While\nConnecticut's experience is a little more favorable than some of its neighbors, the picture is\nbroadly similar.\nAs housing prices have leveled off or declined in New England, foreclosure rates have\nrisen from well below the national average to the national average, which is also rising. Again,\nConnecticut's experience is a little more favorable, but similar.\nThe increase in foreclosures has been particularly sharp for subprime adjustable rate\nmortgages. The typical subprime adjustable rate mortgage is a hybrid, with a fixed rate of about\n8 percent for two years that resets to about 11 percent. The surge in foreclosures thus far is not\ndue to resets. However, many borrowers holding subprime loans face resets in the coming year,\nindeed the next few quarters. This prospect threatens to make a difficult situation even worse.\nSo I am very pleased that five large New England banks have formed a consortium to\nreach out to subprime borrowers to see whether they might be candidates for loans at prime rates,\nmaking use of existing federal and state insurance programs. This initiative, called the Mortgage\nRelief Fund, was launched shortly before Christmas with a $125 million commitment from the\nfive banks and has already has some success in generating inquiries. Exhibit 9 is an excerpt from\nthe effort's web site.\nTo date the banks – Bank of America, Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth,\nand Webster Bank – have had over 430 calls from borrowers, and a number of them are\nbeginning the application process or have already submitted loan applications. Because\nborrowers can qualify for government-insured loan programs with as little as 3 percent equity in\nthe house, this is an important initiative for borrowers to consider if they are currently holding\nsubprime loans.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\nThe challenge, really, is getting the word out and convincing borrowers who may face\ntrouble in coming months that it is in their best interest to act now.\nSo I strongly encourage homeowners paying a high subprime rate, and possibly facing a\nrate-reset to an even higher level, to visit the website – www.MortgageReliefFund.com – to\nbegin exploring whether they would be better off financially by taking advantage of this\nprogram.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is pleased to be working with the five banks on the\nMortgage Relief Fund initiative and commends them for their efforts.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion and by way of recap, the weakness in the housing sector has slowed\neconomic growth in the overall economy. The collateral effects of the residential slowdown are\nlikely to be significantly affected by the path of housing prices and, importantly, how a wide\nvariety of financial intermediaries react to the current and future problems. I have offered a few\nthoughts, gleaned from history, on how I hope financial intermediaries and others will react. In\naddition, I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts\nto date — actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n\n2\n\nNotably, there were 11 consecutive quarters of decline ending in 1958.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED until Jan. 8, 2008,\n10:50 AM Eastern Time or upon delivery\n\n3\n\nThis is not to suggest that the current downturn in residential investment is unprecedented in its severity.\nDownturns that extended from 1978 to 1982 and from 1987 to 1991 were longer but were interrupted by some “up”\nquarters. Also, the 1973-75 downturn in residential investment was arguably shortened by fiscal stimulus (large tax\nrebates) in the second quarter of 1975.\n\n4\n\nThe December Employment Situation report released January 4 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor went on to say that “Job growth in several service-providing industries, including professional\nand technical services, health care, and food services, was largely offset by job losses in construction and\nmanufacturing.

Rosengren\nDecember 20, 2007\n\nMortgage Relief Fund Press Conference\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Bank. We have had a few cancellations among out\nof town speakers due to the snow storm but I would like to thank everyone who was\nnot deterred by the snow. While the snow has made travel difficult around Boston, it\nis good news that Santa's sleigh should have plenty of snow for traction this year.\nI am very pleased to be standing here with financial and political leaders from New\nEngland to announce a joint effort to help subprime borrowers.\nI really commend the banks for stepping forward and working so hard to develop this\ninitiative - which we all hope will assist a key subset of borrowers.\nAnd I thank the governor, the mayor, and the HUD regional director for being here to\nshow their ongoing support and involvement.\nThe recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures has been widely reported, and it is\nvery possible that the problem could worsen.\nToday, these banks are announcing that they want to reach out to some of the New\nEngland homeowners who have been affected - or might be in the future.\nThe banks' initiative, called the Mortgage Relief Fund, should make it easier for\nsome homeowners who are paying high rates - and those who face a reset of an\nadjustable-rate loan - to refinance into a more affordable mortgage, avoid becoming\ndelinquent, and avoid foreclosure.\n\n\fThe five banks -Citizens Bank, Sovereign Bank, TD Banknorth, Webster Bank, and\nBank of America - are stepping forward to play a positive role in the challenging\nsituation facing many New England homeowners and have together committed an\ninitial $125 million for mortgage loans.\nResearchers here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are finding that many\nborrowers holding so-called \"subprime\" loans have solid credit histories and some\nhome equity and should qualify for the Mortgage Relief Fund. Our research suggests\nthat there may be 38,000 borrowers in New England that had 10% equity in their\nhome when they took out the mortgage, had credit scores over 620, and where fully\ndocumented loans for owner occupied houses. For the individual New England\nstates, there are over 15,000 subprime borrowers that satisfy these conditions in\nMassachussetts, over 10,000 in CT, over 3800 in both New Hampshire and Rhode\nIsland, over 3400 in Maine and a little under 1000 in Vermont. This provides a\nconservative estimate of the borrowers that could qualify for this program.\nThe banks expect to incorporate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance\nand beneficial aspects of state programs, which often include flexible underwriting\nand eligibility guidelines. These programs allow banks to offer borrowers a lower\ninterest rate, similar to that of prime borrowers, which could result in savings of\nhundreds of dollars per month and the peace of mind of a fixed rate loan.\nThis fund of $125 million offers genuine help to a subset of borrowers who are at a\nperilous juncture in their mortgage. It is particularly important to find and locate the\nborrowers who may be eligible for a better rate and a healthier relationship with their\nlender. This press conference is meant to stimulate interest so we can do just that -converse with those borrowers who we may be able to assist, study their individual\ncircumstances, and take every responsible step available to us to help them.\nThis initiative began with a discussion with Larry Fish, the chairman of citizens\nfinancial group, about how commercial banks that were not part of the problem could\nnonetheless help in the resolution of the problem. I will now turn the podium over to\nLarry to discuss this bank initiative.\ncollapse all\n\nexpand all\n\nAbout the Authors\nEric S. Rosengren\nEric S.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n\nPortland Regional Chamber of Commerce\nPortland, Maine\nOctober 10, 2007\n\n\fRecent Developments in Real Estate, Financial Markets, and the Economy\n\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPortland Regional Chamber of Commerce\nPortland, Maine\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back in Maine to give my first speech as a Federal Reserve Bank\npresident. Since leaving Maine after graduating from Colby College in 1979, I have spent the\nbulk of my career – as a research economist, a bank regulator, and now a policymaker – studying\nthe ways that problems in financial markets impact the real economy; as consumers, investors,\nbankers, businesspeople, regulators, and policymakers interact1.\nThis morning I would like to share some background on recent economic events, and\nthen discuss recent stresses in housing and financial markets and how these have interacted with\nthe rest of the economy. Let me add that my primary subject today is not the experience of\nsubprime borrowers and the human toll of foreclosures – which is nonetheless a very important\nissue. Today, however, I will speak mainly about the wider ramifications in credit markets and\nthe economy. This is a somewhat less vivid story, but one that we should also understand,\nbecause of the ways that financial- and credit-market matters impact each and every one of us in\nthe economy.\n\n1\n\n\fRecent Economic Events\nAs you can imagine, recent events have made this a very interesting time to be at the\nhelm of a Reserve Bank. Prior to July, the U.S. economy appeared to be settling into a “sweet\nspot.” Inflation was edging down to below 2 percent, and the U.S. unemployment rate – at 4.5\npercent – remained near historic lows.\nTo be sure, there were significant risks to staying in the sweet spot, not the least of which\nwas the weakening of the housing sector. In addition, rising energy prices posed a threat to\nstable inflation, and to consumer spending. Emerging problems in the subprime mortgage\nmarket had captured some attention – particularly the significant rise in foreclosures on\nadjustable-rate subprime mortgages. But at the time, the prevailing view was that despite the\npain for affected borrowers, problems in this sector would remain contained, and in fact, there\nwere few signs of spillover into other credit markets.\nAs you know, circumstances since mid-year have changed significantly. Foreclosure and\ndelinquency rates on subprime mortgages have continued to rise; house prices by some measures\nhave fallen; and credit markets have been turbulent. This turbulence has been reflected in\nincreases in interest-rate spreads between commercial and government debt; a decline in the\nliquidity of securities linked to riskier mortgages, arising from difficulty in obtaining reliable\nvaluations of these securities; a related decline in asset-backed commercial paper used to finance\nshort-term assets; and an unusual rise in the spread between the cost of short-term funding in\nEurope and the U.S.\nAs of mid-August, the combination of higher credit costs and in some cases reduced\navailability of credit threatened to weaken the U.S. economy. On August 17, the FOMC\nannounced that “the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably,” and signaled its\n\n2\n\n\fwillingness to take appropriate actions to mitigate those risks. It followed that statement with a\ncut in the primary credit rate we offer to banks that borrow from the Federal Reserve, to just half\na percentage point above the federal funds rate, and of course followed with a half a percentage\npoint reduction in the federal funds rate at the meeting on September 18.\nResidential investment has been a major source of weakness in the economy for a year\nand a half. Forecasters who were predicting a recovery in the housing sector by the end of this\nyear have been revising down their forecasts to incorporate the effect of rising mortgage defaults,\nfinancial turmoil, and softening housing prices.\nParticularly notable is the decline in housing prices in many regions of the country.\nConsumer spending is affected by households’ net worth and housing equity is an important\ncomponent of wealth. While the effect of the problems in housing on consumption has been\nmuted to date, further and more widespread deterioration in housing prices would increase the\nrisk of a more adverse impact on consumption.\nAs a reminder, housing prices in New England, including Maine, began to appreciate\nrapidly in the second half of the 1990s, and through the end of 2004 price increases in the region\noutstripped those nationally. Over the past year, prices in the region have barely increased and\nare down somewhat in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Prices in Maine have been holding a bit\nbetter than in the region as a whole. When housing prices were rising rapidly in New England,\nthe number of foreclosures initiated was very low – considerably lower, as a fraction of loans\noutstanding, than nationally. Beginning in 2005, however, foreclosure initiations began to rise in\nthe region, particularly for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages. The overall rate of foreclosure\ninitiations is now roughly the same in New England – and Maine2 – as the nation.\n\n3\n\n\fHousing Problems, Financial Markets, and the Economy\nThe housing sector, and the potential “collateral damage” from problems in the housing\nsector, is a significant component in the outlook for the economy. So the balance of my\ncomments will focus on the interaction between housing problems and recent turmoil in financial\nmarkets.\nIn the spirit of this Chamber series, I’d like to address three major issues – in the form of\nquestions:\n First, how did the problems in what was previously viewed as a relatively small, wellsegmented market – subprime mortgages – spread to cause credit problems in so many\nother markets?\n Second, given that subprime mortgages are at the epicenter of current problems, what can\nwe do to help those households who find themselves in difficulty, as well as to prevent\nsuch circumstances from arising again?\n Third, should we view the current developments and concerns in credit markets as a\nwholesale reassessment (or “repricing”) of risk by investors, and are the recent problems\nrelated to securitizing assets likely to have a longer-lasting impact on the economy or\nfinancial markets?\nFirst Question\nBefore I provide the overview, let me hint at the punch line. The recent problems in\nfinancial and credit markets reflect a pulling back from what I would call “surrogate\nsecuritization,” whereby investors were willing to buy debt that had been assigned high credit\nratings by the credit rating agencies, regardless of the underlying assets used in the securitization.\nIn other words, investors basically delegated due diligence to the rating agencies.\n\n4\n\n\fUtilizing ratings to help evaluate the riskiness of securities is a normal part of the\nsecuritization process. But when new securities arise, investors may need to exercise more\ncaution as rating agencies themselves learn about the appropriate risk to attach to the new\ninstruments.\nWhy should this concern not just central bankers, but all of us? Because disruptions in\nthe ability to securitize assets have the potential to affect a much broader set of assets than just\nsubprime loans, and increase the cost and reduce the availability of credit that consumers and\nbusinesses rely on. Let me begin with a few points about subprime debt and the role of\nsecuritization.\nIn essence subprime loans refer to mortgage loans that have a higher risk of default than\nprime loans, often because of the borrowers’ credit history.3 The loans carry higher interest rates\nreflecting the higher risk. Certain lenders, typically mortgage banks, may specialize in subprime\nloans. Banks, especially smaller community banks, generally do not make subprime loans,\nalthough a few large banking organizations are active through mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nThe subprime market has grown dramatically in the past five years but is still small,\nrelative to all domestic financial assets – the value of outstanding subprime mortgages is around\n$1 trillion, while U.S. holdings of financial assets total about $44 trillion. The vehicle used to\nfinance the growth in subprime lending was securitization, which allows for a much larger pool\nof investors, resulting in a greater supply of loans, benefiting many borrowers.\nSecuritization of subprime loans relied on the reasonable premise that subprime loans\nmight be more risky than prime, but the vast majority would not default and higher interest rates\nand fees would compensate for the costs of handling those that did. With securitization, pools of\nsubprime loans were structured, so that “riskiness” was tiered. The expectation was that likely\n\n5\n\n\flosses would be borne first by investors in the riskiest tier. Investors in this tier were akin to\nequity holders. If losses exceeded expectations, then investors in the intermediate tiers –\nessentially subordinated debt holders – would bear the loss. Investors in the least risky, highestquality tiers were thought to be well protected from losses. Based on historical experience, 70\npercent or more of the securities were viewed as relatively safe and could carry high investmentgrade ratings. Often these higher quality securities were also repackaged into new securities,\nsuch as collateralized debt obligations, making the risk tiering even less clear to the investor.\nThe elevated defaults we have already seen on recent vintages of subprime mortgages have\nresulted in losses for the highest risk tiers, and have caused investors to sell higher quality\nsecurities at a discount, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of the investment-grade\nrating.\nIf the ratings were accurate, highly rated securities containing subprime debt would have\nonly a remote chance of default – similar to investment-grade securities containing prime\nmortgages, home equity loans, or student loans. Unfortunately, underlying assumptions for the\nsubprime market were inaccurate for several reasons I’ll describe.\nFirst and most importantly, most parties involved in the process assumed that house\nprices would continue rising nationally. This assumption seems to have had the biggest impact\non the situation we see today. Let me show you a chart our researchers have developed, which\nshows foreclosures and house price growth essentially mirroring one another [Chart 1]. Now,\nwhy is this the case? Earlier subprime securitizations had been issued when home prices were\nrising. In a strong housing market with rising home prices, a borrower who faced the prospect of\nan increase in an adjustable rate mortgage could probably refinance the loan, frequently with a\nwithdrawal of some of the appreciated equity. This is borne out by the fact that the duration of\n\n6\n\n\fsubprime loans was relatively short, suggesting that borrowers were able to refinance into\nanother subprime or prime loan prior to their rate re-setting at a higher level – as long as prices\nwere rising. When prices stopped rising, the option of refinancing out of a mortgage with a\nrising borrowing cost became less available. Lenders’ expectations also seemed to assume that\nprices would not drop (which, of course, diminishes the collateral that secures the loan for the\nlender).\nSecond, the subprime market has grown very rapidly in recent years, so such widespread\nuse of subprime mortgages is a relatively new phenomenon. This limited history made it\ndifficult to assess the likelihood of defaults if underlying economic conditions changed.\nAnd third, the increased reliance on mortgage brokers who originated the loans but had\nlittle stake after they were securitized was a departure from the traditional buy-and-hold strategy\nof many financial institutions. These brokers typically are compensated based on volumes of\nloans made and sometimes on the rates and fees as well; as a result, the brokers have few\nincentives to worry about the longer-term viability of the mortgage.\nAs defaults on recently issued subprime mortgages began to increase despite low and\nstable unemployment, concerns mounted about the accuracy of underlying assumptions for\npredicting defaults. Investors and rating agencies began to reevaluate the risk associated with all\nparts of the securitization.\nWhile holders of the riskiest slices, or “tranches,” of securitizations may have been\nsurprised by the default experience, they certainly knew they were holding relatively risky assets.\nHowever, many owners of investment-grade tranches assumed they faced very low likelihood of\nexperiencing losses. Many of the investors had done little or no independent credit analysis –\nthey were confident enough in the ratings agencies that they did not need to independently\n\n7\n\n\fevaluate the securities, did not worry about the underlying asset, and did not require a significant\npremium to hold the securities.\nToday the situation is very different. Defaults in the subprime market have resulted in\neven the most secure tranches of subprime securitizations selling at a sizable discount. Investors\nare now questioning the appropriateness of surrogate securitization, contemplating more\nindependent analysis of the securities and underlying assets and the need to distinguish between\nsecuritizations with different underlying assets. These are appropriate considerations, to be sure,\nbut until they are more confident, investors have been shying away from even investment-grade\nsecuritization. The problems in securitization are highlighted by the impact on jumbo mortgage\nloans. Because of difficulties in securitization, the cost of these loans has risen significantly\n[Chart 2]. This is particularly a problem in New England where the price of housing is quite\nhigh.\n\nA Second Question\nNow, to our second question. Given that subprime mortgages are at the epicenter of\ncurrent problems, what can we do to help those households who find themselves in difficulty, as\nwell as to prevent such circumstances from arising again?\nSubprime mortgages were particularly dependent on securitization for funding.\nMortgage lenders, working through brokers, originated loans that were then securitized so\ninvestors could buy slices of the pooled assets. Brokers rely on volume and fee income. As\nhome values flattened, or in some cases declined, it appears that more brokers “stretched”\nunderwriting standards to maintain volume. Investors, still eager for higher-yielding, and stillhighly rated, subprime tranches, continued to crave these securitizations. Brokers obliged and\nthe 2006 vintage of loans, in particular, has seen notable rises in early defaults.\n\n8\n\n\fAs investors lost confidence in the ability to evaluate securities whose underlying asset\nare subprime mortgages, many mortgage lenders found themselves with sharply limited access to\nfunds to finance new subprime loans or refinance existing ones. The inability to refinance has\nbeen a key component of the recent rise in foreclosures. Many subprime borrowers refinanced\nseveral times in order to avoid rate resets that would further stretch affordability; and, our\nresearch shows, some withdrew additional household equity with each refinancing – a practice\nthat many prime borrowers followed, too. However, if housing prices stop rising or fall, or if\nfunding for refinance is disrupted, many borrowers no longer have the option of refinancing out\nof increasingly difficult financial circumstances, and may experience foreclosure. Foreclosure, it\ngoes without saying, brings great stress and difficulty to the person affected, and can have\ndisruptive effects that ripple through neighborhoods.\nTo better understand the subprime issue, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been\nstudying publicly-available information from the Registries of Deeds in New England states,\nwhich allows us to study the patterns of mortgages issued on a given house over time. The\nresearchers on this project -- Paul Willen, Chris Foote, Kris Gerardi, and Adam Shapiro – are\nfinding some very interesting results.\nA first finding is that recent foreclosures have been disproportionately related to multifamily dwellings. In Middlesex County, Massachusetts, multi-family properties accounted for\napproximately 10 percent of all homes, but 27 percent of foreclosures in 2007. This highlights a\npotentially serious problem for tenants, who may not have known that the owner might be in a\nprecarious financial position.\nSecond, the Bank’s research shows that the duration of a subprime mortgages is on\naverage quite short – for a sample of subprime mortgages used to purchase a home between 1999\n\n9\n\n\fand 2004, two-thirds have prepaid within two years and almost 90 percent have prepaid within\nthree years. Prepayment will occur if the home is refinanced or if it is sold. While some of those\nsales may have been under difficult circumstances, it is plausible that many borrowers who\npurchased homes with subprime products did benefit from the appreciation of home prices in\nNew England that occurred over the last decade.\nAs noted earlier, default rates for subprime mortgages were relatively low when house\nprices were appreciating, so that borrowers could refinance into another prime or subprime\nmortgage or sell their house. With the recent decline in home prices in New England, however,\nand the drying up of funding from former investors in subprime securitizations, conditions are\nfar less favorable for borrowers who had hoped to refinance or sell before their subprime\nmortgage reset.\nHowever, our research suggests at least three factors may help in finding ways to mitigate\nthe problem:\n First, many subprime borrowers have respectable credit histories. LoanPerformance data\nfrom Middlesex County show that almost two-thirds (64 percent) of borrowers who\nreceived subprime loans had FICO4 scores greater than 620, and 18 percent had scores\nover 700. They may have been in subprime products because they chose to make a highly\nleveraged home purchase, or they may have been steered to a more costly mortgage for\nwhich they might have otherwise qualified. Either way, it is encouraging to note that these\nborrowers could be in a position to refinance to another product.\n Second, many subprime borrowers have held their house long enough for it to appreciate,\nso they may now have sufficient equity in their house to facilitate refinancing into a prime\nproduct.\n\n10\n\n\f Third, many borrowers of so-called \"teaser\" 2/285 mortgages were actually paying a much\nhigher rate than is found on prime loans. The average \"teaser\" rate was 7.3 percent in 2005\nand 8.35 percent in 2006 for loans located in Middlesex County in Massachusetts. This\nsuggests that if these borrowers could qualify for a prime product, they would likely see a\nsignificant reduction in their interest rate.\n\nTrying to mitigate the current problems with subprime mortgages requires a balance –\nbetween providing credit to borrowers who might not otherwise be able to buy a house, and\nensuring that the mortgage they get is appropriate for their financial position. In our research, we\nlooked at what happened to homeowners who used subprime loans to buy their homes and found\nthat five years later, 90 percent were either still in their house or had profitably sold it. While\nour research also shows that number will likely be lower for the most recent vintages, which\nalready exhibit elevated defaults, most subprime buyers have a positive experience with\nhomeownership.\nSo, perhaps the most critical issue is that financing that supports responsible subprime\nlending continues, despite recent problems. Since the broker channel has been disrupted, as\ndescribed earlier, I believe there is an opportunity for commercial and savings banks to help\nprovide liquidity in this market. Most commercial and savings banks were not involved in\noriginating subprime mortgages and are well capitalized, and may have profitable opportunities\nto explore in this market.\nRecently, I have been meeting with bankers from all six New England states to examine\nthe opportunities for commercial banks to get back into this market to help qualified borrowers\nobtain mortgages. They have shown some interest in the opportunities and have agreed to\nexamine how we can encourage borrowers to pursue opportunities with banks before they get\n\n11\n\n\fbehind in their mortgage. To the extent that some subprime borrowers have improved their\nFICO score with regular payments, already had a high FICO score, or have appreciated wealth in\ntheir house, now is the time for these borrowers to seek lower cost financing opportunities. We\nknow anecdotally that some Maine institutions have been active with outreach, and have been\nable to work with borrowers, particularly on refinancing 2/28 subprime mortgages into a fixedrate mortgage or more traditional ARM.\nI am hopeful that financial institutions will play an important role in providing financing\nfor many of the borrowers facing higher rates as their mortgages reset. In the past, rate-resets\nmay not have been as problematic as they could be now, because borrowers had an easier time\nrefinancing or selling.6 As we look at the situation now, we want to see borrowers continue to\nhave the option to refinance, and want to see lenders continue lending – so that resets do not\nbecome an increasing problem. As I said a moment ago, perhaps the most critical issue is that\nfinancing that supports responsible subprime lending continue.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has created several brochures that are intended to\nhelp borrowers consider all their options, and we are creating a web site to help borrowers in\nsubprime products to get information and help looking for refinance opportunities. Working\nwith financial institutions, city and state governments, community organizations, regulators, and\nothers, we at the Fed hope to play a constructive role in mitigating subprime problems.\n\nA Third Question\nNow our third issue for this morning: Should we view the current developments and\nconcerns in credit markets as a wholesale reassessment (or “repricing”) of risk by investors, and\nare the recent problems related to securitizing assets likely to have a longer lasting impact on the\neconomy or financial markets?\n\n12\n\n\fI think the answer is no, investors are not reassessing risk in a wholesale way. Consider\nthat a variety of assets that normally are impacted by investor desire for risk reduction have\nshown little reaction to current problems. For example, if one looks at emerging market debt, or\nstock prices in emerging economies, the current problems have left little trace in the data [Chart\n3]. Prices for stocks in many emerging markets are close to or at their highs for the year.\nBy contrast after September 11, 2001 and during the problems triggered by Long-Term\nCapital Management, stocks in many emerging markets fell sharply. Similarly, emerging market\ndebt has shown only a modest widening of spreads. Following the September 11 attacks and\nduring the Long-Term Capital Management problems, emerging market interest rates rose\nsharply.\nShort-term debt markets, where relatively low risk financial assets are traded primarily\nbetween large financial institutions, are experiencing significantly reduced volumes and\nunusually large spreads. This is consistent with liquidity problems rather than a change in the\nwillingness to hold risky assets in general.\nAllow me to digress for a moment to touch on some unique aspects of the recent problem\nthat may not be widely understood, but impact many of us that borrow for our businesses or\nhouseholds.\nUsually the overnight Eurodollar interest rate is very close to the overnight federal funds\nrate. Both are overnight, unsecured, dollar-denominated loans between financial institutions.\nOver the past two months the funds for overnight Eurodollar have frequently been trading at a\nmuch higher rate than overnight federal funds. This highlights the difficulty that some financial\ninstitutions are having borrowing in dollars, and the wariness of credit exposure to certain\nfinancial institutions.\n\n13\n\n\fAnd these difficulties worsen when we look at one- to three–month maturities, versus\novernight loans [Chart 4]. Consider something which may not be a “household term” to the\nlayperson, the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate or LIBOR, which involves short-term borrowing of\ndollars by banks in Europe. One-month and three-month LIBOR remain very elevated and –\nhere’s the rub – this tightens credit for a variety of U.S. borrowers, since many loans to\nbusinesses and many floating rate mortgages are tied to the LIBOR rate. For example, many\nvariable-rate subprime mortgages are tied to the LIBOR rate.\nOf course, we all want to consider whether the recent problems related to securitizing\nassets are going to have a longer lasting impact on the economy or financial markets.\nSecuritizations have made it possible to efficiently finance pools of assets. In particular,\ninvestors with low risk tolerance were willing to buy what they thought were investment grade\nsecurities without a detailed understanding of the underlying assets as long as they had\nconfidence in the ratings of the securities. To the extent that these investors have less confidence\nin ratings, they may choose to buy government or agency securities, where they do not need to\nmake an independent analysis of potential credit risk. In part, this accounts for the reduction in\nrates on government securities relative to other financial instruments over the past two months.\nAnother symptom of what you might call the “collateral damage” from the end of\nsurrogate securitizations has been the asset-backed commercial paper market7, where the\noutstanding stock shrank from an early August peak of nearly $1.2 trillion to $912 billion as of\nthe end of September, as investors reevaluate the risks [Chart 5]. Asset backed commercial\npaper, or ABCP, would be issued to these short-term investors, with assets such as investmentgrade securities from securitizations used to back the commercial paper. It offered lower-cost\nfinancing to companies as it was asset-backed rather than unsecured.\n\n14\n\n\fAs questions have been asked on ratings of securities, many investors have chosen not to\nroll over commercial paper that was not backed by solid assets and did not have liquidity\nprovisions provided by banks. This “freeze-up,” of course, means problems for financing a\nvariety of assets, including mortgages, student loans, and home-equity loans.\nSecuritizations and asset-backed commercial paper are efficient ways to provide\nfinancing for a wide variety of assets. Unlike some types of liquidity issues, confidence in the\nability to evaluate risk on securitizations is likely to return gradually. Some of the most\naggressive securitizations and forms of ABCP may no longer be worth the risks to many shortterm investors.\nThe alternative to securitizations and financing assets with commercial paper is financing\nby commercial banks. Fortunately, most banks are very well capitalized and have the ability to\nfinance these assets. In fact, bank balance sheets did expand in both August and September,\nreflecting in part banks holding assets on their balance sheet that have been difficult to securitize.\nHowever, while banks have the capacity to finance many of these assets, it is likely that the cost\nof financing for these assets will increase if they are done by banks rather than through financial\nmarkets.\nMy expectation is that over time, investors will gain more confidence in their ability to\nevaluate the quality of ratings, and that conservatively underwritten securitizations and assetbacked commercial paper will find acceptance by investors. A reevaluation of ratings and the\nmodels used to determine ratings, and a greater onus on investors to understand the underlying\nassets and securities they are purchasing is likely to make these markets more resilient.\nHowever, this process of evaluation may take some time. While we have seen improvement in\n\n15\n\n\ffinancial markets over the past month, we continue to observe wider spreads and reduced\nvolumes on securitized products, which may remain until investor confidence has been restored.\n\nIn Conclusion\nIn summary, the past two months have been quite unusual for financial markets. Shortterm liquidity has been disrupted for almost two months, as investors have reevaluated the\nsecuritization process. I am hopeful that with appropriate underwriting, the securitization\nprocess and the ABCP will continue to be a source of financing for a wide range of assets.\nIn the meantime, it will be important for banks to provide their usual role as a provider of\nliquidity during times of distress. While the subprime market that was the epicenter of the\nproblem is likely to continue to have some difficulties, I am hopeful that financial institutions\nwill play an important role in providing financing for many of the borrowers facing higher rates\nas their mortgages reset.\n\n1\n\nThe views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n2\n\nIn terms of the Maine experience with subprime problems and foreclosures, Maine was ranked 14th in the U.S. in\nterms of the percent of loans with a foreclosure initiation, tied with Massachusetts. This was up from being 20th in\nthe first quarter. Subprime ARM loans past due as of the second quarter stood at 19.3 percent, similar to the New\nEngland rate, but above the national rate of just under 17 percent.\n3\n\nAccording to interagency guidance issued, in 2001, “The term ‘subprime’ refers to the credit characteristics of\nindividual borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that include payment\ndelinquencies, and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They may also\ndisplay reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other criteria that may\nencompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories. Subprime loans are loans to borrowers displaying one or\nmore of these characteristics at the time of origination or purchase. Such loans have a higher risk of default than\nloans to prime borrowers. Generally, subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may\ninclude one or more of the following: Two or more 30-day delinquencies in the last 12 months, or one or more 60day delinquencies in the last 24 months; Judgment, foreclosure, repossession, or charge-off in the prior 24 months;\nBankruptcy in the last 5 years; Relatively high default probability as evidenced by, for example, a credit bureau risk\nscore (FICO) of 660 or below (depending on the product/collateral), or other bureau or proprietary scores with an\n\n16\n\n\fequivalent default probability likelihood; and/or Debt service-to-income ratio of 50 percent or greater, or otherwise\nlimited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly debt-service requirements from monthly\nincome. This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive and is not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime\nborrowers. Additionally, this definition may not match all market or institution specific subprime definitions, but\nshould be viewed as a starting point from which the Agencies will expand examination efforts.”\n4\n\n\"Credit bureau risk scores produced from models developed by Fair Isaac Corporation are commonly known as\nFICO® scores. Fair Isaac credit bureau scores are used by lenders and others to assess the credit risk of prospective\nborrowers or existing customers, in order to help make credit and marketing decisions.\" [Source: Fair Isaac\nCorporation]\n5\n\nARMS's known as \"2/28\" loans feature a fixed rate for two years and then adjust to a variable rate for the\nremaining 28 years.\n6\n\nThe Bank’s research shows that a third of borrowers who received a notice of default in Massachusetts in 2006\nowned the dwelling for less than two years, so they could not have hit the 2-year rate reset on a 2/28 subprime\nmortgage.\n7\n\nAsset-backed commercial paper was an innovation that allowed investors interested in short-term high quality\npaper to invest in assets that gave a higher yield than government securities of short-term duration. Investors\nreceived a highly liquid investment instrument that paid somewhat more interest than government securities, and\nthere was a ready market for high grade securities issued through securitization. Much of the asset-backed\ncommercial paper had liquidity and often credit enhancements provided by banks, to insure that investors would\nreceive their money should they decide they no longer wanted to hold the commercial paper. The success of the\nasset-backed commercial paper in financing assets has encouraged some organizations to choose structures that were\nless reliant on liquidity provisions by banks.\n\n17\n\n\fRecent Developments in Real\nEstate, Financial Markets, and\nthe Economy\n\nEric S.

            "content": "Economic Outlook Conference - Boston Fed\n\nNews & Events\n\nHome :: News & Events :: Speeches\n\nEconomic Outlook Conference\nby Cathy E. Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nBurlington, Vermont\nJanuary 12, 2007\n\nAnother January has rolled around — to me, anyway, they seem to come faster every year. The holidays are over, and\nthe reality of a new year has set in. Thus, it’s a good time to stop and reflect on where we've been and what the economy\nmight have in store for us. In that spirit, I’ll begin with a short review of the past year and say a little bit about the local\nsituation here in Vermont. Then I’ll talk about my national forecast. As always, the views I express will be my own and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nTo preview: the economy has come through the last year pretty well, successfully making a difficult transition from\nabove trend growth rates early in the year to a slower pace, with solid job growth and low unemployment. Inflation has\nbeen and remains a challenge, though recent data provide a bit of assurance that price pressures may be beginning to\nebb. Our best guess at the Boston Fed is that 2007 will bring continued moderate growth, with GDP at or a bit below\npotential, unemployment likely remaining below 5 percent, and core inflation gradually declining. Has our economy\nonce again reflected the amazing resilience that enabled us to meet the challenges of Y2K; the tech boom and bust;\n9/11; the Iraqi war; a variety of geopolitical tensions; more than one energy shock, and now a cooling housing market?\nAre we on a trajectory to that sought after but hard to obtain \"soft landing?\" So far, so good, though there are risks and I\nwill talk about them.\nBut first let’s start by looking back to a year ago. At this time last year, the economy was growing robustly. After strong\nyears in ‘03 and ‘04, real GDP rose at better than 3 percent in 2005, and was on course to expand at an even stronger 5.6\npercent in the first quarter of '06. On January 9, the stock market closed above 11,000 for the first time since June 7,\n2001, and longer term debt yields were equally, if somewhat surprisingly, accommodative. Unemployment hit 4.7\npercent in January, and remained below 5 percent for the rest of the year. The economy was cooking along nicely,\nalthough perhaps the heat was turned up a bit too high.\nAnd not all signs were positive. For one thing, oil price increases were poised to affect both growth and inflation. After\nrising through most of 2005, spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil began 2006 at about $60 a barrel, and\ncontinued to climb, exceeding $75 by mid-year before dropping back to about $60-$65, where they remained at year's\nend. The summer travel season saw the impact of both higher prices and seasonal demand, and anecdotes abounded\nabout the toll high gasoline prices were taking on retailers, hotels, and recreational businesses as consumers'\npocketbooks were pinched. Concerns were raised about both the potential for weakening demand, and the upward\nimpact on prices -- virtually the recipe for a central banker's nightmare.\nOn the inflation side, core CPI, that is consumer prices net of food and energy costs, ran at an annual rate of just over 2\npercent in the first quarter. Then core CPI accelerated to almost 2.5 percent in the second quarter, and to 2.8 percent in\nthe third. The headline numbers, those including food and energy, rose even more dramatically, with headline CPI\ntopping out at an annual pace of 5 percent in the second quarter.\nAs you know, while the costs of food and energy are important to all of us, such costs can spike temporarily due to\nshortages, such as those that occurred with the devastating hurricanes in the fall of 2005. What concerns policymakers is\nif these cost spikes feed through to the broader economy -- to prices of non-oil goods and services -- as a result of\nlengthy supply problems or burgeoning demand or some combination of the two. Thus, the strength in both U.S. and\nglobal demand in '05 and '06, combined with rising energy costs, heightened Federal Reserve concerns about inflation.\n\n\fEconomic Outlook Conference - Boston Fed\n\nAnd the rise in core price measures in early '06 did nothing to assuage those concerns. The Fed continued raising the\nkey policy interest rate -- the overnight Federal Funds Rate -- at each of its first four meetings in 2006, a process which\nhad begun two years earlier. By late June, the rate stood at 5.25 percent, in my view very much in keeping with the risks\nfacing the economy.\nThis slow but steady rise in short-term interest rates, and a related gradual erosion in housing affordability, intensified a\nslowing in the housing market that had begun in 2005. Truth be told, however, just as \"trees don't grow to the sky\", U.S.\nhousing markets had to cool off after a good five or more years of rapid escalation, as price growth outstripped income\ngrowth, and demographically driven demand eased off. By early '06, a number of housing construction and sales\nindicators were deteriorating; by second half, all were falling and certain areas saw some actual home price declines. So\nfar, however, such decreases have not been large or widespread geographically. In fact, according to the best national\nmeasures from OFHEO, prices have only decelerated, not declined.\nBut any protracted weakness in housing can make consumers nervous—houses are, after all, a major source of most\nhousehold wealth, and given the proliferation of new financing methods, have become a source of liquidity as well.\nReports on housing activity have consistently come in a little worse than expected, though very recent data on home\nbuying attitudes, new home sales, mortgage applications and slowly declining inventories of unsold homes suggest\nsome bottoming out may be at hand. As of now, our best estimate is that the housing slowdown will shave a percentage\npoint or so off GDP in the second half of 2006.\nOutside of housing, however, much of the rest of the economy seemed to fare pretty well. Rising corporate profits and\nhealthy margins continued to reflect strong corporate balance sheets and productivity growth. Non-residential\nconstruction surged as industries looked to add to capacity, after some years of slow capital spending. In fact, at least\nuntil quite recently when measures of business spending weakened, non-residential construction served to offset a\nportion of the impact of the housing investment slowdown. And businesses continued to hire as well, with monthly job\nincreases more than meeting the level necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force, taking into account that\ndemographic factors probably have likely reduced that level from what it was in the late '90s. More jobs meant rising\nincomes. Lower oil prices by year end also increased the purchasing power of disposable income. And with the impetus\nof a strong stock market, real personal consumption grew at a solid 2.7 percent in the third quarter, and likely exceeded\nthat growth rate in the fourth.\nSpending on autos was off a bit, and certainly the large domestic manufacturers -- the traditional Big Three -- have\nfaced more than a few challenges. But Bank staff believe this took only a small toll on the economy, with the so-called\n\"transplanted\" firms -- the foreign auto firms producing cars in U.S. factories -- picking up market share. Inventories of\nmanufactured goods, particularly goods related to housing and autos, rose and measures of manufacturing strength\ndipped in the fourth quarter as supply was trimmed in the face of cooling demand. Many suggested, however, that\nbusiness purchases of high-tech goods were off, in part, as a result of the delay of the new Microsoft operating system.\nOn the plus side, the cumulative effects of several years of dollar depreciation and relatively strong economic growth\namong our trading partners resulted in better net trade data, and some stabilization in measures of the country's\nindebtedness to the rest of the world.\nThus, as the year ended, the economy seemed to have completed that difficult down-shift in tempo, often\nreferred to as a soft landing. On the inflation front, pressures seemed to ease a bit as November headline CPI grew at an\nannual pace just under 2 percent and core CPI was flat for the month. But for the 12-month period as a whole, core\nremained close to its third-quarter high, suggesting inflation may be slow to taper off.\nTurning to Vermont, growth appears to have been relatively subdued over the past year, with payroll employment in the\nstate increasing at less than 1 percent from November to November, compared to U.S. growth over the year of nearly\n1.5 percent. Over the past five years, however, growth in Vermont has generally tracked that of the nation. This is a\nmarkedly stronger performance than New England as a whole; Connecticut and Massachusetts, in particular, were hit\nhard by the 2001 recession and employment is either not yet back to the levels of the late '90s, in the case of\nMassachusetts, or just over it.\nIt should also be noted that the fraction of workers who are self-employed is somewhat larger in Vermont than the\n\n\fEconomic Outlook Conference - Boston Fed\n\nnation. The activities of the self-employed are not captured in the payroll employment figures. Construction workers,\nartists and entertainers, professional and technical people are all a little more inclined to work for themselves in\nVermont than the country as a whole. With an unemployment rate of only 3.7 percent in Vermont in November, and 3.3\npercent here in the Burlington area, it would seem that those who want to work can do so. Nationally, the\nunemployment rate was 4.5 percent in November and the regional rate was roughly the same.\nSo far, Vermont has been weathering the housing downturn better than either the nation or the rest of New England.\nConstruction activity, as measured by housing permits, seems to be holding up better; and the OFHEO index of home\nprices shows continued appreciation in Vermont. The housing boom came somewhat later to Vermont than to other\nparts of the region, and it has not been quite as pronounced, giving some reason to be optimistic that any adjustment will\nalso be less sharp. Beyond this, if the national economy continues to grow as I expect it will, it would seem that\nVermont should as well. There are longer-term issues facing the state--very slow population growth and an aging\npopulation--just to name two. These concerns are shared elsewhere in New England, with Massachusetts and Rhode\nIsland probably seeing the worst of the trend. But for now, Vermont seems well poised for the new year.\nSo what do I think is in store for the nation in '07? I expect growth to continue at a moderate pace through the last\nquarter of 2006. This reflects sustained consumer spending and business investment, offset, in part, by fallout from the\nhousing market and the manufacturing inventory swing that is underway largely in the housing and motor vehicle\nsectors. Then, I expect growth to accelerate modestly as 2007 progresses, with the housing and inventory situations\ngradually ebbing. With a growth path at or slightly below potential, unemployment is likely to remain below 5 percent\nwhile core inflation should continue to ease.\nOf course, risks abound, both to growth and inflation. What are the chances the economy in '07 will be weaker than I\nhave forecast? The most likely culprit would be a longer and deeper contraction in housing markets than now expected\n-- one that hits not only residential construction but also consumption spending harder than forecast and, through\nconsumers, reduces business profits and spending. This could happen if home prices fall significantly nationwide,\naffecting not just investment in residences but also how wealthy consumers feel. A significant change here could cause\nconsumers to spend less and save more than now expected, a good thing over the longer run given this country's\nsavings/investment gap, but difficult over the short term -- especially given the forecast of moderate growth overall.\nAnd some have argued that new forms of mortgage financing may have exacerbated both increased spending out of\nrising home equity on the upside, and contraction on the downside as falling prices eliminate a major source of\nhousehold liquidity. This is hard to see empirically, but some communities, where mortgage foreclosures have risen as\nthese new forms of financing reprice, are clearly seeing the negative aspects of the broad access to credit these new\ninstruments provided.\nAnd there are other signs beyond housing that may be flashing yellow on growth vulnerability. Certainly, many have\nfocused on what long-term Treasury yields of 50 basis points below the overnight federal funds rate might be telling us\nabout the probability of a downturn. There are several possible alternative explanations for this phenomenon, but it does\nraise one's antennae. Very recent indicators of business spending such as the inventory buildup have been less-thansparkling. Consumer sentiment data has been more positive of late, but Gallup polls suggest the share of those who see\neconomic conditions as good or excellent is lower than one might expect, and exit polls after the election also suggest\nthat concerns about the economy, while not necessarily driving the election results, played a key role.\nSome consumer pessimism could stem from a sense that many workers and their families may have that they are not\nsharing much in recent economic growth. In the nonfarm business sector, inflation adjusted compensation growth fell\nshort of productivity by 2 percentage points or more for several years until 2006. This slow wage growth occurred even\nas business profits were at historically high levels, causing worry that workers are not getting their fair share of the pie.\nIndeed, median household income fell in real terms in every year from 1999 to 2004, and even though it rose slightly in\n2005 -- the latest year for which we have data -- it was still only at about 1998 levels. All of this begs the question -could some combination of housing downturn and pressures on consumers produce a much slower rate of growth than\nnow expected?\nWhile possible, in my view this is not likely for a number of reasons. First, a nationwide drop in house prices fairly\n\n\fEconomic Outlook Conference - Boston Fed\n\nmeasured would be unprecedented, at least for any extended period of time. Indeed, as I noted before, there are signs\nthat the real estate market may be bottoming out and prices firming, though residential investment growth is likely to be\nnegative for some time. Second, employment trends remain solid, and equity markets upbeat, counteracting the impact\non consumer wealth and spending from flattening or even falling home prices in some areas.\nThird, the rest of the world is expected to grow at a pace that equals or surpasses the U.S. Domestic demand abroad\ncombined with a lower dollar should continue to improve the balance of net exports. And finally, U.S. businesses\ncontinue to experience solid profits, and business spending, though affected by the inventory issues mentioned earlier,\nseems likely to rebound in the spring especially in high-tech. Thus, while the consumer could be harder hit than we now\nexpect, I believe the best bet is still that the same resilience that has marked the last decade or so will continue as the\neconomy picks up some speed in '07 and a bit more in '08.\nSo that brings up the other risk facing us -- will inflation ease off as expected, or will upward price pressures remain?\nCould all the positive aspects of our economy -- growing employment, supportive financial conditions, strong\ncorporate profitability and solid worldwide economic growth -- begin to stress labor and product markets, putting\npressure on already elevated rates of inflation? A couple of cautionary notes. As I noted earlier, wage growth trailed\nproductivity for most of the last several years. This pattern changed a couple of years ago, and as a result, unit labor\ncosts rose. This is good news for workers, and given the record-setting corporate profit margins of the past year, firms\nought to be able to manage rising wage costs, particularly in the context of continued solid, if a bit slower, productivity\ngrowth. But one should not ignore the balance of supply and demand in labor markets with unemployment as low as it\nis. The decline in oil prices we saw last year was certainly welcome, and helped to bring inflation down from its midyear peak. But absent further declines, lower energy costs probably won't bring about much of an additional decrease in\ninflation this year.\nPrice stability, so vital to stable economic growth, is a key goal for the Federal Reserve. With unemployment low, and\nother measures of economic capacity suggesting resources are being fully used, it is not surprising that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee has stressed the risks to inflation in its recent statement and minutes. After all, if inflation were to\nescalate, restraining it could require a period of sub-par economic growth. Contained inflation expectations on the part\nof markets and the public contribute importantly to restraining inflation going forward. In that regard, it is encouraging\nto note that despite dramatic swings in headline inflation, and a steady rise in core data, inflation expectations, as best\nthey can be measured by market and survey data, suggest markets and the public believe inflation will remain wellcontained. Managing the risks around that seems to me to be the key issue facing the central bank at this juncture.\nIn sum, the past year has seen the U.S. economy make a difficult transition from higher to slower rates of growth, while\nmaintaining a solid employment trend, good corporate profit growth, and optimistic equity markets. Similarly, the rest\nof the world has grown as well, even against a backdrop of significant geopolitical uncertainty. I expect U.S. economic\ngrowth to accelerate slightly this year, unemployment to remain low, and price pressures to ease a bit. There are risks to\nthis outcome to be sure, but I believe that with the continued resilience of the consumer, and policymaking that is\nfocused on managing inflation, my sense of cautious optimism will turn out to have been justified.\nRelated Links\n\n\f",

Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nHartford, Connecticut\nJanuary 5, 2007\n\nAnother January has rolled around — to me, anyway, they seem to come faster every year. The holidays are over, and\nthe reality of a new year has set in. Thus, it’s a good time to stop and reflect on where we've been and what the economy\nmight have in store for us. In that spirit, I’ll begin with a short review of the past year and say a little bit about the local\nsituation here in Connecticut. Then I’ll talk about my national forecast. As always, the views I express will be my own\nand not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nTo preview: the economy has come through the last year pretty well, successfully making a difficult transition from\nabove trend growth rates early in the year to a slower pace, with solid job growth and low unemployment. Inflation has\nbeen and remains a challenge, though recent data provide a bit of assurance that price pressures may be beginning to\nebb. Our best guess at the Boston Fed is that 2007 will bring continued moderate growth, with GDP at or a bit below\npotential, unemployment likely remaining below 5 percent, and core inflation gradually declining. Has our economy\nonce again reflected the amazing resilience that enabled us to meet the challenges of Y2K; the tech boom and bust;\n9/11; the Iraqi war; a variety of geopolitical tensions; more than one energy shock, and now a cooling housing market?\nAre we on a trajectory to that sought after but hard to obtain \"soft landing?\" So far, so good, though there are risks to\nboth economic growth and price stability, and I will talk about them.\nBut first let’s start by looking back to a year ago. At this time last year, the economy was growing robustly. After strong\nyears in ‘03 and ‘04, real GDP rose at better than 3 percent in 2005, and was on course to expand at an even stronger 5.6\npercent in the first quarter of '06. On January 9, the stock market closed above 11,000 for the first time since June 7,\n2001, and longer term debt yields were equally, if somewhat surprisingly, accommodative. Unemployment hit 4.7\npercent in January, and remained below 5 percent for the rest of the year. The economy was cooking along nicely,\nalthough perhaps the heat was turned up a bit too high.\nAnd not all signs were positive. For one thing, oil price increases were poised to affect both growth and prices. After\nrising through most of 2005, spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil began 2006 at about $60 a barrel, and\ncontinued to climb, exceeding $75 by mid-year before dropping back to about $60-$65, where they remained at year's\nend. The summer travel season saw the impact of both higher prices and seasonal demand, and anecdotes abounded\nabout the toll high gasoline prices were taking on retailers, hotels, and recreational businesses as consumers'\npocketbooks were pinched. Concerns were raised about both the potential for weakening demand, and the upward\nimpact on prices -- virtually a central banker's nightmare.\nOn the inflation side, core CPI, that is consumer prices net of food and energy costs, ran at an annual rate of just over 2\npercent in the first quarter. Then core CPI accelerated to almost 2.5 percent in the second quarter, and to 2.8 percent in\nthe third. The headline numbers, those including food and energy, rose even more dramatically, with headline CPI\ntopping out at an annual pace of 5 percent in the second quarter.\nAs you know, while the costs of food and energy are important to all of us, such costs can spike temporarily due to\nshortages, such as those that occurred with the devastating hurricanes in the fall of 2005. What concerns policymakers is\nif these cost spikes feed through to the broader economy -- to prices of non-oil goods and services -- as a result of\n\n\fConnecticut Business and Industry Association - Boston Fed\n\nlengthy supply problems or burgeoning demand or some combination of the two. Thus, the strength in both U.S. and\nglobal demand in '05 and '06, combined with rising energy costs, heightened Federal Reserve concerns about inflation.\nAnd the rise in core price measures in early '06 did nothing to assuage those concerns. The Fed continued raising the\nkey policy interest rate -- the overnight Federal Funds Rate -- at each of its first four meetings in 2006, a process which\nhad begun two years earlier. By late June, the rate stood at 5.25 percent, in my view very much in keeping with the risks\nfacing the economy.\nThis slow but steady rise in short-term interest rates, and a related gradual erosion in housing affordability, intensified a\nslowing in the housing market that had begun in 2005. Truth be told, however, just as \"trees don't grow to the sky,\" U.S.\nhousing markets had to cool off after a good five or more years of rapid escalation, as price growth outstripped income\ngrowth, and demographically driven demand eased off. By early '06, a number of housing market indicators were\ndeteriorating though starts remained positive. By the second half of the year, however, starts dropped off as did sales of\nboth new and existing homes, and certain areas saw some actual home price declines. So far, however, such decreases\nhave not been large or widespread geographically. In fact, according to the best national measures from OFHEO, prices\nhave only decelerated, not declined. But any protracted weakness in housing can make consumers nervous—houses are,\nafter all, a major source of most household wealth, and given the proliferation of new financing methods, have become a\nsource of liquidity as well. Reports on housing activity have consistently come in a little worse than expected, though\nvery recent data on home buying attitudes, new home sales, mortgage applications and slowly declining inventories of\nunsold homes suggest some bottoming out may be at hand. As of now, our best estimate is that the housing slowdown\nwill shave a percentage point or so off GDP in the second half of 2006.\nOutside of housing, however, much of the rest of the economy seemed to fare pretty well. Rising corporate profits and\nhealthy margins continued to reflect strong corporate balance sheets and productivity growth. Non-residential\nconstruction surged as industries looked to add to capacity, after some years of slow capital spending. In fact, at least\nuntil quite recently when measures of business spending weakened, non-residential construction served to offset a\nportion of the impact of the housing investment slowdown. And businesses continued to hire as well, with monthly job\nincreases more than meeting the level necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force, taking into account that\ndemographic factors probably have reduced that level from what it was in the late '90s. More jobs meant rising incomes.\nLower oil prices by year end also increased the purchasing power of disposable income. And with the impetus of a\nstrong stock market, real personal consumption grew at a solid 2.7 percent in the third quarter, and likely exceeded that\ngrowth rate in the fourth.\nSpending on autos was off a bit, and certainly the large domestic manufacturers -- the traditional Big Three -- have\nfaced more than a few challenges. But Bank staff believe this took only a small toll on the economy, with the so-called\n\"transplanted\" firms -- the foreign auto firms producing cars in U.S. factories -- picking up market share. Inventories of\nmanufactured goods, particularly goods related to housing and autos, rose and measures of manufacturing strength\ndipped in the fourth quarter as supply was trimmed in the face of cooling demand. Many suggested, however, that\nbusiness purchases of high-tech goods were off, in part, as a result of the delay of the new Microsoft operating system.\nOn the plus side, the cumulative effects of several years of dollar depreciation and relatively strong economic growth\namong our trading partners resulted in better net trade data, and some stabilization in measures of the country's\nindebtedness to the rest of the world.\nThus, as the year ended, the economy seemed to have completed that difficult down-shift in tempo, often referred to as a\nsoft landing. On the inflation front, pressures seemed to ease a bit as November headline CPI grew at an annual pace\njust under 2 percent and core CPI was flat for the month. But for the 12-month period as a whole, core remained close to\nits third-quarter high, suggesting inflation may be slow to taper off.\nTurning to Connecticut, the state has seen slow but steady growth for over two years. This is reflected in the\nunemployment rate which is essentially the same as the national average and well below the state’s early 2003 high of\nalmost 6 percent. However, job growth has been slow during this period. Payroll employment in November was up only\n0.6 percent compared to a year earlier, while national growth was more than double that. Manufacturing and\nconstruction employment was flat or declining, but, like the nation, services employment grew nicely -- particularly\neducation and health services and financial activities.\n\n\fConnecticut Business and Industry Association - Boston Fed\n\nThe significance of financial activities is sometimes overlooked. Finance and insurance account for about 8 percent of\nemployment in Connecticut, but 17 percent of labor compensation – double the share of that sector nationally and more\nthan any other sector of the Connecticut economy. Thus, while other sectors in the state employ more people, none\ncontributes as much to the earnings of the state. And overall, earnings and related incomes in Connecticut remain strong\nwith the state retaining its spot as the state with the highest per capita income. Of course, a high cost of living goes\nalong with this high income level, a concern that is shared by other New England states, most notably your neighbor\nMassachusetts.\nAs in the nation, Connecticut is currently experiencing a sharp decline in housing activity. The number of new housing\npermits in November was more than 40 percent below the level of a year ago. Sales of existing homes were also off\nsharply. Home prices seem to be holding up relatively well, however. According to the OFHEO index, prices in the\nthird quarter were still 6 percent above the year before, although most of this gain took place in late 2005 and early\n2006. There has been a pickup in foreclosures as there has been elsewhere in the region. But the state's foreclosure rate\nis less than that for New England states overall, and below that for the nation as a whole.\nFinally, let me mention an aspect of the state's longer term health that has received considerable attention -- recent\ndemographic trends including net-out migration and an aging population. These concerns are shared to varying degrees\nby all the New England states, most particularly Massachusetts.\nThese concerns are clearly understandable. The state's population grew only 3 percent from 2000 to 2005 compared to\ngrowth of 5 percent nationally. But we should put this into perspective. Such growth was a relative improvement over\nthe 1990s, when the state grew only 3.6 percent over the entire decade, while the nation grew almost 4 times faster.\nDespite Connecticut’s recent weak employment growth, net out-migration over the past five years was half the level\nduring the period 1995 to 2000 and immigration from abroad has been robust. And while it is true that Connecticut’s\npopulation is older than the nation's, it is not older by New England standards. Maine and Vermont rank at the top in\nterms of median age, while Connecticut is a relatively young #8.\nI do not mean to trivialize concerns here as state leaders try to tackle the real challenges the state faces, but at least for\nthe current cycle Connecticut seems likely to continue to benefit from the health of the national economy. Connecticut's\neconomic performance over the past year has been quite solid; the state's businesses seem to be providing jobs for those\nwho want work, and attracting an inflow of mature, educated workers and immigrants; incomes are high and rising, and\nthe state stars in the important area of financial services. Nothing is without risks, of course, and there are longer-term\nissues both in this state and others in New England, but '06 seems to have left Connecticut well positioned for the new\nyear.\nSo what do I think is in store for the nation in '07? I expect growth to continue at a moderate pace, in the neighborhood\nof 2 percent in the last quarter of 2006. This should reflect sustained consumer spending and business investment offset\nin part by fallout from the housing market and the manufacturing inventory swing that is underway largely in the\nhousing and motor vehicle sectors. Then, I expect growth to accelerate modestly as 2007 progresses, with the housing\nand inventory situations gradually ebbing. With a growth path at or slightly below potential, unemployment is likely to\nremain below 5 percent while core inflation should continue to ease.\nOf course, risks abound, both to growth and inflation. What are the chances the economy in '07 will be weaker than I\nhave forecast? The most likely culprit would be a longer and deeper contraction in housing markets than now expected - one that hits not only residential construction but also consumption spending harder than forecast and, through\nconsumers, reduces business profits and spending. This could happen if home prices fall significantly nationwide,\naffecting not just investment in residences but also how wealthy consumers feel. A significant change here could cause\nconsumers to spend less and save more than now expected, a good thing over the longer run given this country's\nsavings/investment gap, but difficult over the short term -- especially given the forecast of moderate growth overall.\nAnd some have argued that new forms of mortgage financing may have exacerbated both increased spending out of\nrising home equity on the upside, and contraction on the downside as falling prices eliminate a major source of\nhousehold liquidity. This is hard to see empirically, but some communities, where mortgage foreclosures have risen as\nthese new forms of financing reprice, are clearly seeing the negative aspects of the broad access to credit these new\n\n\fConnecticut Business and Industry Association - Boston Fed\n\ninstruments provided.\nAnd there are other signs beyond housing that may be flashing yellow on growth vulnerability. Certainly, many have\nfocused on what long-term Treasury yields of 50 basis points below the overnight federal funds rate might be telling us\nabout the probability of a downturn. There are several possible alternative explanations for this phenomenon, but it does\nraise one's antennae. Very recent indicators of business spending such as the inventory buildup have been less-thansparkling. Consumer sentiment data has been more positive of late, but Gallup polls suggest the share of those who see\neconomic conditions as good or excellent is lower than one might expect, and exit polls after the election also suggest\nthat concerns about the economy, while not necessarily driving the election results, played a key role.\nSome consumer pessimism could stem from a sense that many workers and their families may have that they are not\nsharing much in recent economic growth. In the nonfarm business sector, inflation adjusted compensation growth fell\nshort of productivity by 2 percentage points or more for several years until 2006. This slow wage growth occurred even\nas business profits were at historically high levels, causing worry that workers are not getting their fair share of the pie.\nIndeed, median household income fell in real terms in every year from 1999 to 2004, and even though it rose slightly in\n2005 -- the latest year for which we have data -- it was still only at about 1998 levels. All of this begs the question -could some combination of housing downturn and pressures on consumers produce a much slower rate of growth than\nnow expected?\nWhile possible, in my view this is not likely for a number of reasons. First, a nationwide drop in house prices fairly\nmeasured would be unprecedented, at least for any extended period of time. Indeed, as I noted before, there are signs\nthat the real estate market may be bottoming out and prices firming, though residential investment growth is likely to be\nnegative for some time. Second, employment trends remain solid, and equity markets upbeat, counteracting the impact\non consumer wealth and spending from flattening or even falling home prices in some areas.\nThird, the rest of the world is expected to grow at a pace that equals or surpasses the U.S. Domestic demand abroad\ncombined with a lower dollar should continue to improve the balance of net exports. And finally, U.S. businesses\ncontinue to experience solid profits, and business spending, though affected by the inventory issues mentioned earlier,\nseems likely to rebound in the spring especially in high-tech. Thus, while the consumer could be harder hit than we now\nexpect, I believe the best bet is still that the same resilience that has marked the last decade or so will continue as the\neconomy picks up some speed in '07 and a bit more in '08.\nSo that brings up the other risk facing us -- will inflation ease off as expected, or will upward price pressures remain?\nCould all the positive aspects of our economy -- growing employment, supportive financial conditions, strong corporate\nprofitability and solid worldwide economic growth -- begin to stress labor and product markets, putting pressure on\nalready elevated rates of inflation? A couple of cautionary notes. As I noted earlier, wage growth trailed productivity for\nmost of the last several years. This pattern changed in '06, and unit labor costs rose. This is good news for workers, and\ngiven the record-setting corporate profit margins of the past year, rising wage costs ought to be manageable, particularly\nin the context of continued solid, if a bit slower, productivity growth. But one should not ignore the balance of supply\nand demand in labor markets with unemployment as low as it is. The decline in oil prices we saw last year was certainly\nwelcome, and helped to bring inflation down from its mid-year peak. But absent further declines, lower energy costs\nwon't bring about much of an additional decrease in inflation this year.\nPrice stability, so vital to stable economic growth, is a key goal for the Federal Reserve. With unemployment low, and\nother measures of economic capacity suggesting resources are being fully used, it is not surprising that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee has stressed the risks to inflation in its recent statement and minutes. After all, if inflation were to\nescalate, bringing it back under control would require policy changes that restrict short term growth even further.\nContained inflation expectations on the part of markets and the public are crucial to the price situation going forward. In\nthat regard, it is encouraging to note that despite dramatic swings in headline inflation, and a steady rise in core data,\ninflation expectations, as best they can be measured by market and survey data, seem to suggest markets and the public\nbelieve inflation will be well-contained. Managing the risks around that seems to me to be the key issue facing the\ncentral bank at this juncture.\nIn sum, the past year has seen the U.S. economy make a difficult transition from higher to slower rates of growth, while\n\n\fConnecticut Business and Industry Association - Boston Fed\n\nmaintaining a solid employment trend, good corporate profit growth, and optimistic equity markets. Similarly, the rest\nof the world has grown as well, even against a backdrop of significant geopolitical uncertainty. I expect U.S. economic\ngrowth to accelerate slightly this year, unemployment to remain low, and price pressures to ease a bit. There are risks to\nthis outcome to be sure, but I believe that with the continued resilience of the consumer, and policymaking that is\nfocused on managing inflation, my sense of cautious optimism will turn out to have been justified.\nRelated Links\n\n\f",

            "content": "News & Events\n\nHome :: News & Events :: Speeches\n\nThe Role of Central Banks in Economic and Personal Finance Education\nby Cathy E. Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nSeptember 28, 2006\nWarsaw, Poland\n\nGood morning. I am delighted to be here today in Warsaw to meet with this diverse group of central bankers and\neducation leaders from around the world. I hope in my comments today I can convey a sense of the enthusiasm and\nengagement with which I and my colleagues within the Federal Reserve System approach both the need for and the\nprovision of economic and financial education. As we engage the public in current policy issues or as we and our staffs\ntry to make the underlying concepts of our market-based economy accessible and interesting, there is, I believe, a very\nreal commitment to this as a vital central bank activity.\nI want to thank the National Bank of Poland and the ECB for their foresight in conceiving of a conference on “The Role\nof Central Banks in Economic and Personal Finance Education,” and for the efforts of their staffs in turning that concept\ninto a reality. I'd also like to thank my colleague Steve Malin from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for his work\non the Conference and his invitation to speak. My comments today focus first on why the Federal Reserve System\nfocuses attention on these areas, and second on some lessons I believe are important as we strive to make our efforts as\neffective as possible.\nAt the outset, let me say that central bank support for economic and financial education is a form of enlightened selfinterest. We recognize that an informed public -- a public that understands our role in the economy -- will be far more\nlikely to understand and accept the reasoning behind the difficult decisions that central banks sometimes have to make.\nMoreover, monetary policy must consider such matters as inflation expectations on the part of consumers, businesses\nand markets, and their confidence in central bank resolve -- so as we make and implement policy, public understanding\nof economic and financial matters is very helpful.\nUnderlying that, however, is an even more compelling reason for our involvement: for anyone living in a market\neconomy, understanding basic economic concepts and making sound financial decisions are essential survival skills.\nThese same skills also inform the decisions that individuals make as citizens. And those informed decisions help to\nshape sound economic growth.\nLast, but by no means least in the case of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Congress has charged us with helping to\nassure that financial services and access to credit are available and accessible on as broad and as fair a basis as possible.\nIn carrying out this very important responsibility, we employ the carrot as well as the stick, as the saying goes. The stick\nis regulation and supervision, and the carrot involves our convening abilities and, increasingly, our capabilities in the\nareas of economic education and financial literacy.\nUsing our stick, we write and enforce regulations to ensure that banks treat their customers fairly and that they serve\ntheir entire communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. If examiners find that a bank’s\nperformance is lacking, that bank may find other aspects of what it is doing that are subject to regulation affected in\nsome way.\nBut we also have carrots to go with our stick. We can convene groups to get communities and financial institutions\nworking together on issues of fairness and access and when we invite organizations to the table they usually come. But\nincreasingly, we see a need and an opportunity to play more of a role in advancing economic and financial literacy.\n\n\fWhat does it mean to be economically and financially literate? The answer to that key question depends on who you\nask.\nConsumer advocates believe we should concentrate on teaching people to be smart consumers, shop wisely, and avoid\nthe pitfalls of the marketplace.\nProponents of financial literacy prefer to focus on individuals making wise financial choices that will lead to using\nmoney wisely and building wealth over a lifetime.\nAnd the umbrella of economic education covers a variety of views. One school of thought favors the straightforward\nteaching of basic economic concepts. Another promotes the virtues of entrepreneurship. Others would use economic\neducation to advance specific arguments: the virtues of free trade, the imperative of saving, the benefits of certain\ngovernment programs, the costs of higher taxes – the list is endless.\nSo, which approach is best? Rather than spending time and effort debating a question that has no single right answer, we\nmight do better to adopt the view of the great English economist, Alfred Marshall, who saw economics as \"the study of\nmankind in the ordinary business of life.\" Marshall’s words suggest that our best chance for success lies in helping\npeople to make the connections between economics and the ordinary business of life -- connections that include the\nability to make sound financial decisions, build wealth, safely navigate the hazards of the marketplace, and evaluate the\npolicy decisions that face all citizens.\nAt the Federal Reserve, our commitment in this arena is deep and longstanding. Originally, much of the emphasis was\non the workings of the Fed – our structure, our various functions, how monetary policy is made. The goal was to remove\nsome of the mystery surrounding the central bank and, hopefully, build confidence in its operational excellence and the\nquality of its decision-making. As part of this effort, many of the Reserve Banks give tours of their facilities. A visit to\nthe gold vault at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was always – and still is – a great hit. And both Governors and\nReserve Bank Presidents feel strongly about the need to inform and educate the public about monetary policy and our\nvarious economic perspectives. I believe the resulting insights are important bulwarks to our credibility as policymakers.\nThe Federal Reserve also has a long involvement in economic education more generally. As I already noted, a public\nthat understands basic economic principles and how the economy works will have a better understanding of the\ndecisions made by policy-makers, including the Federal Reserve System. They will be better informed and more\neffective as citizens. They will also be better informed in their individual lives as consumers, workers, business owners,\nand providers for their families and their own financial security.\nThe System has a number of programs and publications that focus on teaching economics, both directly and through\nproviding support services to high school and college teachers of economics. For example, we in Boston produce an\neconomic education newsletter for teachers, administrators and the general public. This provides clear and concise\ndiscussions of key issues that teachers can use in developing their lesson plans, as well as a wealth of references to other\nresources. In addition, because the writing is lively and the illustrations are colorful, many teachers provide the\nnewsletter directly to their students. Other Banks offer very similar materials, and we increasingly work together to\nprovide the variety of materials and formats teachers need.\nOver the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a shift in emphasis. Increasingly, the Federal Reserve\nSystem, along with other organizations, sees a need for greater attention to financial literacy as opposed to traditional\neconomic education. As I noted before, financial literacy refers to the ability to make well informed personal financial\ndecisions.\nAmong the reasons for the growing urgency attached to financial literacy are a proliferation of sophisticated financial\nproducts and new financial services providers. I must say that even I need a little tutoring to understand all the potential\npitfalls of the new mortgages that have become commonplace offerings by banks and nonbank providers in the U.S., so\nI have a lot of sympathy for the first time low or moderate income home buyer. And technological change has made the\nlending process at once easier and perhaps less transparent. Lenders may or may not be regulated as banks, adding\nanother layer of potential complexity.\n\n\fIn addition, changes in corporate retirement plans and health insurance systems are shifting responsibility for planning\nfor workers’ long term financial security from businesses to the workers themselves. Even relatively well educated,\nrelatively affluent households find themselves challenged by this shift and the need to take more responsibility for their\nfinancial future.\nAt the same time, immigration patterns in recent years have brought many people to the United States who have little\nfamiliarity with our financial system. In some cases, unfortunate experiences in their home countries have caused them\nto distrust and avoid mainstream financial institutions. Not only are those who lack financial literacy skills more likely\nto make mistakes in such key financial decisions as purchasing a home or automobile, financing their education or\nretirement, or starting a business; but they also run the risk of exploitation.\nAs we think about how best to meet the challenges of improving economic and financial education, I see five lessons\nthat can be drawn from the Federal Reserve’s experience.\nLesson Number One: Start at the top!\nWithout support from people at the top, even the best of intentions will not translate into concrete actions. Addressing\nthe need for economic and financial literacy takes resources, so you need the commitment of key decision-makers\nwithin the central bank. Moreover, if these programs are to be successful within schools and communities, you need\nsupport at the top there as well.\nBoth Chairman Bernanke and former Chairman Greenspan set the tone in making economic and financial education a\nhigh priority. Chairman Greenspan spoke frequently on the topic. He participated in a System-wide public service\ncampaign to highlight the importance of financial literacy; the campaign included radio and television announcements\nand a toll-free number. He, along with several Reserve Bank Presidents including me, served as volunteer teachers to\n7th graders in order to publicize the importance of saving and financial planning.\nChairman Bernanke is just as committed to this issue, speaking quite often on it. Just this month, when he was honored\nin his small home town in South Carolina, he reminded us that what underlies all the economic data are millions of\ncitizens “working hard, trying to better themselves economically, struggling to manage their family finances, and\nworrying about the price of gas and college tuition.” Economies are made up of individuals, and the better informed and\neducated their economic decisions, the more likely the economy’s prosperity.\nIn the twelve Reserve Banks that are the regional arms of the Federal Reserve System, the Presidents actively reinforce\nthis message. They all devote significant resources to economic education and financial literacy. Across the Banks,\nmore than 75 full-time staff members work to deliver a wide variety of services and products related to economics and\npersonal finance. And we all work hard to engage school commissioners, union heads, and administrators to ensure our\nservices and products meet their needs. Their top down support within their own organizations helps to make the work\nReserve Banks do effective.\nLesson Number Two: Engage a wide array of audiences.\nFor a long time, people in economics talked mainly to one another and then wondered why the public wasn't more\ninterested in equations and Greek letters.\nWe have learned to broaden our outlook. Experience has taught us the importance of engaging a wider public by\ntargeting our materials and media to various (and more diverse) audiences.\nAnyone who wants to see just how far we have come, need only look at the Federal Reserve's economic education web\nsite -- aptly named www.federalreserveeducation.org. The site offers easy access to educational resources from all the\nBanks and the Board of Governors -- resources that include a simple introduction to the Fed, an FOMC simulation, a\nFederal Reserve Kids Page, an online currency exhibit, a unit on building wealth, and much, much more. All of it is free\nof charge and very accessible by a variety of audiences.\n\n\fBy way of advertisement, last year, in Boston alone, we distributed nearly 100,000 free copies of publications ranging\nfrom comic books on banking basics to electronic media dealing with identify theft, to more serious studies on monetary\npolicy issues. We also opened our doors to upwards of 12,000 local students and teachers, who participated in\neducational programs intended to broaden their understanding of the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the global\neconomy, economic growth, and personal finance. We held conferences on matters of regional public policy, and major\neconomic significance. And more than 540,000 visits have been made to our public website. So our audience spans the\nrange from grade schoolers to senior citizens, from the naïve to the sophisticated, and we try to engage them all.\nLesson Number Three: Collaborate as much as possible.\nExperience has taught us that we, as central bankers, cannot possibly hope to turn every citizen into a trained economist\nor a financial wizard; nor should that be our aim. Our most useful contribution to economic and personal finance\neducation may lie in giving a boost to, or adding value to, the efforts of other organizations. This can take the form of\ncreating high-quality educational resources, enlisting our economists to assist in educational efforts, or even something\nas simple as opening our doors for meetings and conferences.\nOne of the most effective tools we have as a central bank is our power to convene, a power that's grounded in our\nreputation for fairness, integrity and credibility. People respect us and trust us -- even if they do not always like us or\ntrust one another. They know that when we bring them together, they can expect a fair and honest exchange of ideas and\nopinions.\nI have seen this firsthand when consumer advocates and representatives from the financial services industry have come\ntogether at our Bank -- in the same room! -- for a (mostly) non-confrontational exchange of views on issues of mutual\nconcern. And I have seen it in meetings around our District as we sometimes bring together people on both sides of a\ncommunity development issue, and it is clear they haven't had much recent interaction.\nThe Federal Reserve System collaborates with a number of organizations to deliver economic education and financial\nliteracy programs. Some of these organizations are national in scope and some are local and some are in-between. In\nBoston, for example, we work with an organization called Citizens Schools, which provides after-school educational\nexperiences in the professions to high school students. Most recently, we have collaborated with Citizens Schools in a\nprogram that provides practical guidance about planning for college or university expenses, while highlighting the\nimportance of financial planning more generally. While Citizens Schools started in Boston, it is expanding into other\nparts of the country and we hope that our college program will be part of its curriculum as it does.\nAnother example: The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has had considerable success highlighting the importance of\nfinancial literacy in its District with a “Money Smart Week.” The Bank and almost 200 local partners, including\nChicago’s major newspapers, offer about 300 financial literacy programs during the week. This is an exciting\ncollaboration and I know other Reserve Banks are interested in using this model.\nLesson Number Four: Make it teacher--friendly.\nThere are many demands on a teacher's time, and most teachers in the United States have little background in\neconomics. Taken together, these two factors can prevent even the most motivated teacher from tackling economic and\nfinancial education.\nWith that in mind, we in the Reserve Banks strive for an educational approach that offers teachers a maximum amount\nof flexibility. Most of our materials are designed so that educators can easily plug them into the existing school\ncurriculum. We also try to structure the materials so teachers can use as much or as little of the content as they see fit.\nWe endeavor to develop programs that allow students to work on their own. One of our most popular programs at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston is an interactive quiz on our public web site that uses professional sports, baseball in\nparticular, to teach economic principles. The site, called “Peanuts and Crackerjacks” gets tens of thousands of website\nhits a year. I have been told it is the second most frequently visited section of the Bank’s website, surpassed only by the\nsection on employment opportunities at the Bank. The success of this program has led us to develop another interactive\ngame that will use the music industry to teach how markets work. This will also allow us to reach more varied\n\n\faudiences, through different styles of music. But both programs are fun and easy to use, as well as informative.\nWe are also mindful of the fact that teachers -- like most of us -- tend to shy away from things that are difficult to use, so\nwe make a concerted effort to offer them support in using our resources. This summer, for example, the Reserve Banks\nin Boston, New York, and Dallas jointly hosted a teacher workshop on globalization. Research economists made\npresentations and answered questions on topics such as the emergence of China as an economic powerhouse and the\neffects of migration on labor markets. Judging by the evaluations we received, it was a huge success.\nOf course, when the workshop ended some of the teachers still had reservations about our transition to a global\neconomy. But one thing seemed certain: They were now less likely to look for simple solutions or overly-simple\nexplanations.\nLesson Number Five: Make it fun!\nMaybe you're a true believer, convinced that kids need to know more about economics. If that is the case, then go ahead.\nPut your convictions to the test! Walk into a classroom and start telling the \"leaders of tomorrow\" why studying\neconomics will make them healthy, wealthy, and wise. Then launch into a discussion of basic economic principles. And,\njust for good measure, be sure to work in that tired old story about a factory that produces “widgets.” If you are lucky,\nno one will fall asleep and you might walk out of the room with your dignity intact.\nThis is not to say that we should give up on teaching economics to anyone under the age of 18. When we manage to\nspark their interest, young people often respond with enthusiasm and an intuitive grasp of economic reasoning. The\nchallenge, of course, is to spark their interest. Sometimes we can do it with packaging. At the Federal Reserve, we have\ncome to recognize the importance of making our publications and web-based resources informative and appealing.\nBut we have also found that adding an element of fun is crucial to success. There is absolutely no reason why economics\nhas to be \"the dismal science.\"\nThe System has experienced great success with student competitions that give participants an opportunity to sharpen\ntheir knowledge and showcase what they have learned in the areas of consumer awareness, personal finance, economic\nliteracy -- even monetary policy! As one example, we sponsor two, so-called Fed Challenges, in which teams of high\nschool and college students compete with each other in mock Open Market Committee meetings. Believe me, the\nexpertise of the winning teams is astounding to those of us who judge the competitions locally and nationally.\nIn Boston, our permanent educational exhibit, The New England Economic Adventure, has shown us the benefits of\nadding an element of hands-on fun to an economic lesson. Since its opening in 2003, thousands of students and their\nteachers have visited the Adventure, and their reaction has been so overwhelmingly positive that I would like to take a\nfew of my final minutes to share our experience with you.\nThe Adventure uses interactive investment games, exhibits, artifacts, and activities to help students understand how 200\nyears of economic change and technological innovation have affected our everyday lives. And although the focus is on\nthe stories of New England's economy, the Adventure's message has broader applications.\nOne of its main themes is that economic growth and increased productivity have had a major impact on our material\nstandard of living. To emphasize this point, we created a display of artifacts from three different time periods -- 1810,\n1890, and 1960 -- and it has served as an effective catalyst for discussions of economic issues. This display is a perfect\ncure for nostalgia. One look at the chamber pot from 1810 is enough to convince most people that the good old days\nmight not have been as good as we sometimes like to think. And the mere fact that there are no cell phones, iPods, or\ninternet connections in the 1960 display instantly persuades our student visitors that life is better than it used to be.\nTo our surprise, however, their teachers are sometimes more ambivalent on that point. They agree that our material\nstandard of living is higher and our level of physical comfort is greater, but they sometimes wonder if our lives really\nare richer or more fulfilling than those of our parents and grandparents. They talk to us about their concerns over the\nhectic pace of modern life, stress in the workplace, increased pressures on family life, and a lower level of community\ninvolvement.\n\n\fWhile these conversations challenge the message our exhibit conveys, they also showcase economic education at its\nbest, because when all is said and done, our aim is not to tell people what to think but, rather, to offer them a basis for\nmaking their own assessments. And if we do our job effectively, they will be able to use economics as a framework to\nassess the questions and quandaries of everyday life. We hope that the thousands who visit the Adventure each year\ncome away with an enhanced appreciation of the role that their own financial habits can play both in their personal\nfuture, and the health of the overall economy.\nWhich brings me to my final point.\nThe modern world is a complicated place. We face increasingly complex economic and financial choices that require a\ngreater level of sophistication on the part of our citizens. A basic grasp of economics and personal finance will not only\nimprove their ability to navigate a changing job market, or to build wealth for their future. It will also help them to\nsensibly engage -- as voters, taxpayers, or consumers -- the big issues of our time, including those involved in monetary\npolicy making. This, in sum, is why central banks should be concerned about and involved in economic and financial\nliteracy.\nNeedless to say, we face a formidable challenge in raising the overall level of economic and financial literacy in the\nUnited States and in your countries. In each case it will require the support and resources of those at the top; creativity\nin engaging a wide array of audiences; collaboration among providers; reaching out to teachers; and most of all a\ncommitment to making all this as much fun as possible. Difficult, perhaps, but as I look out at all the people gathered in\nthis room, I see tremendous reason for optimism.\nThank you\n\nRelated Links\nFederal Reserve Education\nNew England Economic Adventure\n\n\f",

            "content": "News & Events\n\nHome :: News & Events :: Speeches\n\nRemarks to the National Association of Business Economists\nby Cathy E. Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nSeptember 11, 2006\n\nGood morning. Let me welcome you again to Boston. It’s a pleasure to have the National Association of Business\nEconomists here in our city. And it was certainly a pleasure to entertain you last night at the Bank. As we recognize the\nfifth anniversary of 9/11 it seems to me to be important to assess both the state of the U.S. economy and the economic\nhealth of the world. In that regard, I know this will be a fruitful and productive conference, as there is no dearth of\neconomic challenges on which to focus.\nI want to start my comments this morning with a thumbnail sketch of my thoughts on the current state of the U.S.\neconomy. Following that, I want to spend most of my time on an important challenge facing us in the medium term -the declining trend in U.S. savings, in particular the savings people need to provide for a financially secure retirement.\nIn discussing this issue, I will draw on work done by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College headed by\nAlicia Munnell, who among her many past accomplishments has served as our Bank’s research director. I will also talk\nabout what the field of behavioral economics has to say about policies to increase personal savings. Behavioral\neconomics is a new focus of the Boston Fed -- we recently formed a new center to enhance our expertise in this\nevolving area, and particularly to hone in on what this field has to say about macro policy formation. Finally, I want to\nshare with you some perspectives on financial literacy as that is key to the savings question. And, of course, any\nthoughts I share with you are mine and not those of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nOne of the more striking features of the current economic outlook, reflected in the forecast at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Boston as well as in other mainstream forecasts, is how relatively benign it is. Against the backdrop of the war in\nIraq, the uneasy ceasefire in the Middle East, the looming fiscal deficits driven by demographic change everywhere in\nthe developed world, and sizable international imbalances, the forecast for the next couple of years seems quite\noptimistic.\nYet, as near as we in Boston can tell, the best baseline forecast is that U.S. growth will moderate from its average of\naround 4 percent in the first half of 2006 to something slightly below its potential of a bit less than 3 percent over the\nnext year or so. At this pace, the growth of demand will roughly match that of aggregate supply, and lead to little\nchange in unemployment. Moderate growth in jobs and real income is expected to sustain consumer spending, even as\ncooling housing markets and high energy prices take their toll.\nResidential construction has already fallen, and may well slow further. But this seems likely to be offset, at least in part,\nby increases in non-residential construction as businesses add needed capacity after years of sub-par spending. Solid\nbusiness profits and reserves of cash also augur well for a pick-up in business fixed investment, and recent data for\norders and shipments of capital equipment suggest such a pick-up is occurring. Productivity growth remains solid\nproviding some cushion for resource utilization.   Financial conditions in both debt and equity markets remain fairly\naccommodative, making borrowing relatively affordable and softening the impact of flattening house prices on\nhousehold wealth. Globally, growth is solid as well. U.S. exports have increased and trade is at least for now\nmarginally supportive of growth. Finally, the baseline forecast also sees inflation subsiding slowly, assuming no further\ngeopolitical or other shocks to oil prices. But more on that later. To summarize — I see growth for the next year or so\nin the high 2’s, approximately full employment, and core inflation subsiding. Not a bad picture, particularly given the\nchallenges I mentioned a moment ago.\nThe next obvious question concerns risks — where are they and how likely are they to materialize? In my view, risks\n\n\fhave grown over the summer on both sides of this forecast. Growth could be slower or inflation could be higher and\nmore persistent -- or both. I take both of these risks seriously.\nOn the risks to growth, one obvious concern is the housing market. Trends in housing affordability and sales affect the\npace of residential construction, now over 6 percent of GDP and up from its historical average of closer to 4 percent.\nThe Bank’s baseline forecast assumes a continued moderate downturn in residential construction. I’m comfortable with\nthat baseline, but recent data on declines in starts and permits, gloomy assessments by builders, the potential for higher\nmortgage rates, and increased inventories of unsold homes, remind me that this assessment could well be optimistic.\nAn even larger downside could result if nominal home prices actually decline, rather than flatten out as projected,\naffecting household wealth and overall spending more than anticipated. Moreover, some have suggested that changes in\nthe ease and terms of mortgage financing spurred more than normal spending during the years of rapidly rising home\nequity. By that logic, as financing costs rise and equity withdrawals decline, the resulting spending hit could be even\ngreater than that suggested by wealth trends.\nThese are serious concerns. However, I take a measure of reassurance from a number of factors. First, a fall in nominal\nhome prices nationwide would be quite an unusual event. We have never seen a sustained decline in nationwide home\nprices in any of the more reliable price measures. Even now, as residential construction wanes, home prices, adjusted\nfor quality, continue to grow, albeit at a much slower pace. Second, the so-called “wealth effect” that links increases\nand decreases in house prices with rises and falls in consumer spending may not be as strong as some analysts suggest.\nIn our estimation, the run-up in housing values over the past several years did not spur much of a bigger-than-expected\nincrease in consumer spending — if anything, the response was a bit on the low side compared to the historical average.\nSo we wonder about how large a spending effect one should expect to accompany a fall in housing prices, if that were to\noccur. Clearly mortgage equity withdrawals have been sizable during the housing “boom,” but many of these\nwithdrawals were used to reduce other forms of consumer debt and to make one-time improvements in the housing\nstock. Indeed, as a result, overall household balance sheets today continue to look fairly strong.\nThat is not to say, however, that rising mortgage interest rates are not negatively affecting borrowers. It also does not\nmean that new types of mortgages won’t contain more than a few nasty surprises. Of particular concern are sub-prime\nborrowers and perhaps some depository institutions specializing in subprime lending. Thus, there are clear risks to the\nbaseline housing outlook. Overall, however, I continue to think the best guess is that consumption will moderate, not\ncollapse, as the result of cooling housing markets, and that moderate employment growth, and moderately rising income\nand non-housing financial wealth will buoy household spending.\nAnother concern is the recent and not very favorable trend in inflation at the headline and the core. Headline CPI and\nPCE numbers (currently at 4.2 percent and 3.4 percent year over year, and 5.0 percent and 4.1 percent for the most\nrecent quarter) are high and rising over the near term, mostly as the result of energy prices. These energy price\nincreases reflect not only geopolitical shocks but also growing world demand for oil, particularly by the emerging\ngiants, India and China. The feed-through of higher oil prices is likely one reason why core inflation also has increased\nmarkedly over the past months, though the breadth and persistence of that increase also suggest a role for pressures\nrelated to overall resource utilization. The Bank’s baseline forecast assumes that if energy prices stabilize as indicated\nin the futures market, core inflation will gradually subside. That is my best guess at this point and, based on inflation\nexpectations measured in a variety of ways, private-sector individuals, businesses, and financial markets appear to\nagree. But, as others have said repeatedly, monetary policy is about risk management. A key risk is that inflation will\ncontinue to rise or persist at high levels and embed itself in consumer and business plans. Managing that risk is clearly\nimportant, and a matter about which central banks need to be quite vigilant – as I believe the FOMC has been and will\ncontinue to be.\nWhile the near term forecast seems benign, though certainly not without risks, the medium-term presents real\nchallenges. One of these involves the dearth of U.S. national savings, more particularly savings by households and the\nfederal government. Let me say a couple of words about the overall numbers, and then turn to the question of personal\nsavings and the retirement of today's workers. Given the demographics, the health and welfare of the consumers in this\ncohort is a vital aspect of our nation's future.\n\n\fAs many of you no doubt know, U.S. national savings, now about 13 percent of national income, is down about five\npercentage points since the late 1990s, and is lower in the U.S. than in any other major developed country. National\nsavings includes both private savings by households and firms, plus public savings or the net of government spending\nand tax receipts. Let’s start with public saving, and the federal budget deficit — which reached $318 billion in 2005.\nRelative to the overall size of GDP, the current budget situation doesn’t look all that dire; the deficit was about 2.6\npercent of GDP in 2005, a decline from 2004 and relatively low when compared to the 1980s. Indeed, the fiscal deficit\nas a share of GDP has declined through this year as well. But it would be a mistake, I think, to take a great measure of\nconfidence from this short-term trend.\nOne must recognize that the deficit would be much larger, 4.1 percent for fiscal 2005, if it were not for a sizable surplus\nin Social Security — a surplus that is the direct result of payroll tax rates designed to prepare the Social Security system\nfor the surge in benefit payments that will result as baby boomers retire. By 2030, almost one in five U.S. residents will\nbe 65 years or older. Well before then, beginning in about 2018, Social Security will start to pay out more in ben­efits\nthan it receives from payroll taxes. Even before that, -- in the neighborhood of 2010 -- Social Security will start\nexerting upward pressure on the unified federal budget deficit as its surplus diminishes, with a consequent reduction in\nnet public saving, absent changes in the program itself, increased taxes, or reduced spending on other government\nprograms.  \nThe situation for Medicare is similar and, potentially even more serious. Payroll taxes to cover Medicare expenditures\nare currently in surplus. Over time, however, Medicare spending is expected to increase more rapidly than related tax\nrevenues, creating a deficit prob­lem that analysts see as potentially greater in size and more difficult to deal with than\nthat associated with Social Security.   Thus, despite the relatively benign federal deficit we currently see, it is clear the\nsituation will worsen dramatically over the next decade. And, unlike the late '80s when deficits became a national\nconcern, there seems to be no political consensus on the nature of this problem or its resolution -- a fact that should be a\nconcern to all of us.\nAlong with the decline in public saving, the personal savings rate is now in negative territory. In the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s, personal saving in the U.S. was running at about 7 percent of personal income; in 1994, it dropped to 4.8\npercent; by 2005 it was actually negative and remains so. A key question here is whether the U.S. consumer is saving\nenough for retirement, particularly given the nature of the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Given the\ncountry’s demographics, the retiring baby boomers, faced with inadequate retirement income, could impact overall\nspending and place additional burdens on the government programs and tax rates. The issue is also of concern when\none considers the high stakes for low- and moderate-income consumers who face the most difficulty saving and have\nthe smallest margin for error. So for overall macro concerns, and distributional reasons, the question of the adequacy of\nsaving for retirement is key.\nNow some have rightly pointed out that the National Income and Product Account’s measurement of savings on which\nthe personal savings rate calculation is based may not be well-suited to questions about the sufficiency of household\nsavings for retirement. Measured NIPA savings does not include capital gains, and thus may omit what households\nconsider an important component of their retirement resources.\nOn the other hand, there are also NIPA accounting rules that tend to overstate saving, such as the fact that interest\nreceipts and payments are included in nominal terms and that pension contributions to saving don’t net out the\nassociated future tax liability. In addition, NIPA investment excludes spending on education, which most households\nsurely undertake because they expect it to raise future income and add to retirement resources. So NIPA measures may\nnot tell the whole story about the adequacy of retirement resources, and they certainly do not address distributional\nissues. But, one should not ignore the headline message -- personal savings need to grow.\nOthers take a different approach to measurement — one that focuses not on aggregate measures of saving but on the\nretirement readiness of individual households. The Center for Retirement Research (CRR) has developed a National\nRetirement Risk Index to measure the share of working-age households that are in danger of being financially\nunprepared for retirement. Their findings are sobering. They report that almost 45 percent of all such households are\n“at risk” of falling well short of the amount estimated to be necessary to maintain the household’s pre-retirement\nstandard of living. Younger households are particularly vulnerable, as are low-income households and those with\n\n\fneither a defined benefit pension nor a 401(k) plan. Other studies perform similar exercises and come to similar\nconclusions. A number of you may have been involved in such efforts in the course of your work.\nWhat accounts for the gloomy retirement picture? Part of the explanation is simply that Social Security will replace a\nsmaller fraction of pre-retirement earnings as the normal retirement age rises from 65 to 67, assuming that people do not\ndelay retirement. Another important part is the shift away from defined benefit pensions to voluntary defined\ncontribution plans, such as 401(k) plans. Since most workers save little outside of employer-sponsored plans, they are\nan increasingly important part of our nation’s retirement readiness. While 401(k)s and IRAs have the potential to work\nwell, they require some expertise and discipline from workers who typically must choose to enroll, decide how much to\nsave, and how their savings will be invested.\nAlthough the projections are worrisome, there are a number of avenues for action. For younger households especially,\nrelatively small changes in savings behavior could substantially reduce the number of households at risk if they occur\nearly enough. Stress tests of the CRR model show that increases in the saving rate of only 3 percent among Generation\nXers could reduce the number of households “at risk” substantially. Good news, but this is a fix that is easy to prescribe\nand much harder to accomplish. How do we encourage people to save more?\nGood public policy can help. In that vein there may be some assistance from the Pension Reform Act of 2006 which\nCongress passed in early August with broad bipartisan support. The bill is more than 900 pages long and contains some\nvery complex provisions, so it may be awhile before its implications are fully understood. Nonetheless, it has a number\nof provisions that appear likely to increase the flow of savings into both defined benefit and defined contribution plans,\nand to produce a modest increase in national saving. They include increasing the funding target for most defined benefit\npension plans from 90 to 100 percent. And they would allow 401(k) plans to automatically enroll workers; that is,\nworkers would have to “opt out” if they don’t want to participate.\nThis brings me to some encouraging developments from the emerging field of behavioral economics. Behavioral\neconomics attempts to incorporate insights from psychology and other social sciences into the study of economics, and\nsome of its insights have been particularly helpful in studying savings behavior. For example, behavioral economists\nhave focused on the insight that people don’t always behave in a consistent fashion over time. In other words, they\noften have a hard time getting themselves to do in the short-run what they know is best for them in the long-run. This is\ntrue when it comes to exercise and to diet — and it is also true for retirement saving. Not surprisingly, people tend to\ngive in to the immediate gratification of spending even though they know they would be better off in the long run if they\nsaved. Households end up saving less than they really intend or want.\nAnother psychological phenomena addressed by behavioral economists is that people sometimes become overwhelmed\nwhen faced with a complicated decision that has many choices and options and they may respond in a counterproductive\nway by procrastinating or making no decision at all. Retirement planning can be complicated and anxiety-provoking for\nthe person trying to figure out what to do. Some end up putting the decision off, maybe even indefinitely.\nOf course many people are well aware of these difficulties and adopt strategies to help them save, such as saving by\nautomatic payroll deduction or using tax withholding to save over the course of a year. In essence, these are precommitment devices that make it more likely that a person’s short-run impulses do not undermine their long-run goals.\nSuch insights from behavioral research are already helping design saving programs that deal with complexity and self\ncontrol issues. One example is adjusting the default option in a savings program — whether people have to “opt out”\nversus “opt in.” People are more likely to join a 401(k) program if they are automatically enrolled and have to actively\ndrop out than if the default is non-enrollment and they have to decide to sign up. The new pension reform bill, by\nexplicitly allowing “automatic opt in” could really help companies in shaping their 401(k) programs.\nTaking this a step further are programs that automatically increase 401(k) contributions with salary increases by having\nstaff commit to this in advance. Results from one such program showed a high proportion of those offered the plan\nenroll, and the majority of those who enroll stay in at least through the fourth pay raise. Average savings rates among\nparticipants almost quadrupled, from 3.5 percent to over 13 percent in the first 40 months of the program.\nA number of researchers have suggested that simplified portfolio choices might help overcome procrastination and\n\n\fencourage more people to enroll in 401(k) plans. In one study, allowing people to enroll using a preset contribution rate\nand asset allocation tripled the number of new employees enrolling in the program and increased enrollment by current\nemployees by more than 10 percentage points. Now, these programs might also have downsides; some may feel that\nthey are too paternalistic or worry that they encourage people to be too conservative in their investment decisions.\nBut these studies are also promising, as they point the way to more research that will resolve some of the uncertainties\nand help us devise even better programs in the future. Perhaps some of them will come out of the Boston Fed’s new\nCenter for Behavioral Economics and Decision-Making. The Center is an exciting innovation for us, as behavioral\nresearch has potential applications to many aspects of monetary policy and bank supervision as well as savings\nbehavior. One new initiative from this Center is an effort by Boston Fed economist Stephan Meier to better understand\nthe credit problems of low-income individuals and specifically study how credit counseling can improve individual\ncredit outcomes. The Center also is co-sponsoring a conference with Boston University and the Research Foundation of\nthe Chartered Financial Analysts Society this fall on the development of new financial products and policy to address\nconsumer savings and investment issues.\nThis raises an area that is probably already apparent to all of you. That is the importance of financial literacy if workers\nand households are going to be able to save effectively for retirement. Planning for retirement has always been a\ncomplicated undertaking, requiring a fair amount of sophistication and financial skill. But a number of changes in the\neconomic landscape — particularly the introduction of new technology and advances in financial instruments and\ninstitutions, along with the increased reliance on 401(k) saving — have really raised the bar on the level of\nsophistication and financial literacy necessary for effective planning. More than ever, people need to be well informed\nabout the options they face and the potential outcomes that might arise from their decisions.\nUnfortunately most assessments of financial literacy only serve to underscore how far we have to go. One 2004 survey\nfound that only a third of adults over 50 years of age surveyed could answer basic questions about interest\ncompounding, inflation, and risk diversification. Fewer than one third had ever tried to devise a retirement plan — and\nof those who tried, many didn’t succeed. In another survey, more than a third of respondents could not even guess at the\namount they would need for retirement. Other studies have shown that financial literacy is a particular problem among\nlow-income individuals, people who are especially at risk because of limited resources.\nNow again, there is some good news. We have reason to think that financial education works — that it improves\nknowledge and is associated with better behavior and outcomes. For example, one study suggests that high school\ncurriculum mandates were effective at increasing students’ exposure to financial education and were also associated\nwith higher saving rates and net worth in adulthood. Others find that workplace education can increase participation in\n401(k) plans and increase wealth, especially in families in the bottom of the distribution and with less education. One\nstudy even suggests the possibility that workplace training may have social spillovers to other employees, raising\nparticipation in savings programs even among coworkers who did not attend training.\nIncreasing the general level of financial literacy is also an area of special concern and involvement for the Boston Fed\nand the Federal Reserve System in general. To this end, the Federal Reserve undertakes a variety of financial education\nactivities focused on increasing access to information about financial products and services, supporting and identifying\nbest practices, and collaborating with educational and community organizations to improve financial literacy. Some of\nthe initiatives focus on students, others on adults, and they cover a wide range of issues.\nMany either directly or indirectly try to improve savings and retirement decisions. For example, at a System level, we\nare active in America Saves, a campaign sponsored by nonprofit, corporate, and government groups targeted at helping\nlow- and moderate-income individuals and families save and build wealth. In Boston, as I mentioned, among our many\nactivities we are trying to better understand the credit problems of low-income people. We have also put a lot of effort\ninto on-line games that make learning the basic concepts of economics fun, and have developed our own \"Economic\nAdventure\" at the Bank to teach the concepts behind rising standards of living in a hands-on way. We hope the over\n12,000 students and others who visit the Adventure each year come away with an enhanced appreciation of the role their\nown financial habits can play both in their personal future, and in the health of the overall economy.\nU.S. national savings are a major concern. More attention needs to be directed at the potential medium term fiscal\n\n\fdeficit. As the economy slows over the near term, consumers could become more uncertain about the future and save\nmore. Indeed, most forecasts assume this will happen. But more is needed here as well. Individuals must focus more\non retirement savings, given the evolving picture of corporate benefits and the challenges facing both Social Security\nand Medicare. We at the Boston Fed believe there is much that can be done to encourage more savings. Through\ninnovative ideas and research, we continue to learn more about how to devise savings programs in ways that encourage\npeople to participate and help them save more. New and better programs to more effectively reach out to improve\neconomic education and financial literacy can also help. We also encourage you, the country’s business economists, to\njoin us and look for ways to participate in this most important endeavor. In that way, we can all look forward to a better\neconomic future for ourselves and our country.\nRelated Links\n\n\f",

            "content": "News & Events\n\nHome :: News & Events :: Speeches\n\nComments to New England Realtors Conference\nby Cathy E. Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nMarch 20, 2006\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today to share my views and also to hear yours. The residential and commercial real\nestate markets are always key contributors to the health of the economy. But, as I am sure you all know, the real estate\nsector—and particularly the housing market—is one of the bigger question marks policymakers face in managing the\nrisks to the likely course of economic activity over the next year or so. So I am especially glad to have a chance to be\nhere and to exchange views. And, of course, the views I will share are mine and not necessarily those of others on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nThe good news is that, in my view, the short- to medium-run likely course of the economy is quite positive. Economic\ndata taken over short periods of time are always bumpy, and the impact of hurricanes, energy shocks, and the on-again,\noff-again effect of auto sales incentives on consumption acted to make the end of 2005 more than normally bumpy. But\noverall, the four-quarter growth rate for last year was quite solid, and I and others expect 2006 to be the same. Indeed,\nwhen Chairman Bernanke addressed the House and Senate Banking Committees in mid-February, he discussed the 2006\neconomic projections of the members of the Board and the Reserve Bank Presidents. The central tendency was for real\nGDP growth of about 3-1/2 percent, unemployment in a low range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent, and core inflation at about 2\npercent. Altogether, a very positive picture for a highly developed, nearly $13 trillion economy well into its fifth year\nof expansion. There are short-term questions to be sure -- the impact of changes in residential housing markets and the\nprospects for inflation are two -- but, overall, the economy in 2006 seems likely to be very well-behaved.\nBut what about the longer term? Despite our economy's resilience and relatively high rates of productivity growth, I\nam concerned that we have been living beyond our means. Personal savings rates have declined sharply. Using\nreasonable assumptions about longer-term revenue and spending streams, federal fiscal deficits, while moderating as a\nshare of GDP in 2005, are poised to grow sharply as baby boomers retire. And, of equal concern, this country's external\ndeficit has grown as well reflecting surging U.S. demand for imported goods. Such demand contributed significantly to\nthe growth of foreign economies, and their continuing desire to invest their dollars in our country's debt and equity\nmarkets has helped minimize the impact that might otherwise be caused by our country's savings/investment imbalance.\nIndeed, just as one example of the variety of foreign investment here, there are anecdotes of significant foreign\npurchases of both residential and commercial real estate in some markets, and maybe you have witnessed this first hand.\nBut being the world's biggest debtor has its downsides. It puts us at risk that foreign investment desires may change,\nwith potentially harmful effects on the stability of our financial markets. The best guess is that any such change would\nhappen slowly given the reliance of other countries on U.S. imports for growth. But past experiences in other countries\nwith large external deficits leaves one cautious about being too sanguine. Indeed, if our current account deficit\ncontinues to grow faster than GDP, there will be a continued deterioration in our net international investment position.\nThat creates an obligation to pay increasing amounts to foreign owners of U.S. debts, and eats into our very ability to\ninvest in our future. I believe the best place to start in reining in our external deficit is to increase national savings, most\nspecifically by working to reduce government dissaving. I want to use some of my time today to talk to you about the\nlonger-term challenges facing this country. But first, let me focus on the outlook for next year.\nAs I noted earlier, while growth was a bit slow at the end of 2005, much of this reflected relatively transitory issues.\nFor one, the quarter suffered from post-Katrina effects, as well as a slump after incentive-driven automobile spending in\nthe third quarter. A jump in energy costs also affected the end of the year. But energy costs have declined a bit after the\n\n\fQ4 jump, rebuilding after Katrina has begun, and government and private spending has strengthened. As a result, early\n'06 has gotten off to a strong start.\nThe economy added more than 240,000 jobs during February, bringing the average pace of job growth over the most\nrecent three months to 186,000, in excess of the number needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. As a result,\nthe unemployment rate declined over the past three months to 4.8 percent, the first time it has reached that level since\nthe late '90s.\nSustained consumer spending this year will depend importantly on sustained employment growth. This is especially the\ncase if, as I expect, there is some flattening in the rate of increase in household wealth coming from residential real\nestate. Consumption is a key component to the Bank's outlook, so we were heartened to see the recovery in consumer\nconfidence following the hurricanes and the spike in oil prices. I view this as confirmation of a solid foundation to\nconsumption spending.   \nTurning to investment, I expect businesses to continue their 2005 solid pace of spending on equipment and software, as\nat least some of the capital goods acquired in the spending boom of the late '90s are replaced and new capacity is added.\n  Clearly, the “fundamentals” for investment spending -- expectations of productivity growth, overall business\nprofitability, and accommodative debt and equity markets -- are there. Indeed, the data we see on shipments and orders\nsuggest that near-term capital spending is already off to a strong start early in 2006.\nOne of the greatest areas of uncertainty in the Bank’s outlook is one near and dear to you, the residential housing sector.\nAs rising interest rates and high prices have made home buying more expensive, sales of new and existing homes have\nslowed nationally -- and even more so in the Northeast. Despite slower sales, construction of new homes, while\nreceding from record highs, continues at quite high levels, a situation which has been the subject of many news reports.\nThe resulting rising stock of unsold new homes will likely bring about a modest decline in construction, probably\naccompanied by a gradual flattening of house prices. As construction of new homes slows and the pace of growth in\nhousing wealth eases, economic activity will be restrained. The question is \"How much?\" Residential investment is\nnow slightly over 6 percent of GDP, a higher fraction than in the past 10-15 years. Most forecasters -- FRB Boston\nincluded -- expect that share to decline somewhat as the construction of new homes tails off. Obviously, such a\ncontraction in residential investment will slow GDP growth over what it might have otherwise been.\nOf more significance, perhaps, is the effect on consumption of a decline in the growth rate of household wealth related\nto a change in house prices. Housing equity is under a third of total household net worth, but recently the relatively\nrapid growth in house prices has accounted for much of the upward movement of overall wealth. Generally speaking,\nwhen household wealth increases, consumption does as well, on the order of 3-4 cents on the dollar of increased wealth.\nThus, most analysts believe U.S. consumption over the last several years has been bolstered by increases in household\nwealth brought about by rising home prices.\nWhat happens if home prices flatten or even decline? The theory would suggest that consumers will reduce their\nspending by about 3-4 cents for every dollar of wealth reduction that ensues, all other things being equal. Moreover,\nsome have argued that mortgage market conditions in general, and new types of mortgage instruments in particular,\nhave made borrowing out of home equity easier. This may have augmented consumption as house prices rose -- thought\nthis is difficult to see in the data -- and as prices flatten or decline, might contribute to a larger contraction in spending\nthan might otherwise be the case.\nFrom a macro perspective, it makes sense to worry about the potential impact on overall GDP growth of a combination\nof a reduction in housing construction and a decline in household wealth. The Bank's baseline forecast takes what might\nbe seen as a rather conservative perspective here. We see construction diminishing somewhat and real estate prices\nflattening, not declining, and those assumptions are built into the solid GDP growth rate I referred to earlier. Clearly,\nhowever, we could be wrong on the magnitudes. Real estate prices could actually decline (though this has never\nhappened for the nation as a whole at least on a nominal basis) and construction activity could retrench more than we\nexpect. And rising mortgage rates could impede consumption more than our forecast predicts. Thus, changes in\nresidential real estate present a source of downside risk to growth. I should also note here that in recent times residential\nreal estate markets have often outperformed expectations, a fact with which this audience is more than familiar.\n\n\fBut the risks are not all in the direction of slower growth. Stronger growth and somewhat higher inflation are well\nwithin the realm of possibility as well. Consumption could be less affected by waning real estate markets than we\nexpect, particularly if more consumers are working. With unemployment rates at their recent levels, some possibility\nexists that labor costs will begin to rise faster than productivity, which in turn could put pressure on inflation. That\nhasn't happened yet in the aggregate and we expect healthy productivity growth to continue after its Q4 drop-off.\nIndeed, at the Boston Fed we have begun to hear anecdotes about skilled labor being even harder to find and more\nexpensive than earlier, but this is usually in the context of a continuing emphasis by businesses on working harder and\nsmarter in the face of keen competition. It is also true that rather low labor force participation nationwide could suggest\nlabor markets are less tight than the unemployment rate suggests.    However, judging the precise extent of resource\nutilization is difficult and there is a need here for some vigilance.\nMoreover, worldwide GDP growth in 2006 is expected to maintain the robust levels of recent years, with resulting\nresource pressures. Demand from the rapidly growing developing nations, especially China and India, has pushed up\ncommodity prices, though overall non-oil import price growth has been moderate. Even before the hurricanes, energy\nprices were rising, reflecting world demand. While prices are generally off their hurricane peaks, they remain high\nsimply as a result of the pressure of demand over available supply. Given the current geopolitical unrest in oil\nproducing regions, new energy price spikes are clearly possible, though this is understandably hard to predict. In our\nbaseline forecast, high productivity, healthy profit margins, and well-anchored inflation expectations are expected to\nkeep core inflation growth around 2 percent. There are risks to this inflation forecast to be sure, just as risks exist that\ngrowth will be slower. As a result, I believe monetary policymakers need to watch how evolving economic activity\naffects the balance of these risks to assess what actions are necessary.\nTo end our economic overview closer to home, the New England economy ended 2005 with employment levels just a\nbit above year-end 2004. Massachusetts accounts for about half of the region’s jobs, and was particularly hard hit by\nthe end of the late '90s telecom bubble and the overall slowdown in the tech sector. This state has seen slower\nemployment and income growth than the rest of the country since 2001. Still, as of January, state unemployment rates\nin New England are all at or below the national average. While manufacturing in the region continues to lose jobs, as it\ndoes most everywhere in the U.S., employment across New England is expanding solidly in professional and business\nservices, financial activities, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. And recently, we have also\nbegun to see some life in the Boston downtown and suburban commercial real estate markets, as class A vacancy rates\nhave come down somewhat and rents have begun to increase.\nIs New England likely to feel the sting of cooling residential housing in a more significant way than the rest of the\ncountry? To be sure, home prices in New England are higher than most of the rest of the country, and the pace of\nappreciation has been greater here at least until the last couple of years. However, unlike the late '80s, residential\nconstruction has not boomed, and there has been little speculative building. Various studies of the New England market\ndo see some overvaluation relative to fundamentals such as personal income, density, and environmental restrictions,\nbut the amount is relatively small. The question is how much will prices fall? So far, the data on this are not clear. In\none set of monthly numbers, Massachusetts residential real estate prices fell in early '06; other data suggest only a\nsharply slower pace of growth. But even in the early nineties, home prices fell much less than they had appreciated in\nthe decade earlier.\nI should also point out here that much has been written about the new forms of mortgage financing that have been\nrapidly increasing as a share of mortgage originations. As key players in residential real estate markets, I am sure you\nhave seen interest-only loans, and loans whose low initial required payment amounts can create negative amortization.\nMany are worried that the combination of these new mortgage instruments and borrowers who may be both highly\nleveraged and low to moderate income could result in real problems as interest rates escalate in conjunction with\nsoftening prices. There is no doubt that some potential exists for consumer hardship. At present, both national and\nregional bank credit quality and foreclosures remain at historically very low levels, though a very recent slight\ndeterioration is evident. Indeed, recent bank supervisory guidance issued for comment by all the federal regulators has\nsuggested caution on the part of both residential and commercial lenders in assessing credit quality of borrowers, the\nappropriateness of the loans extended and loan concentrations. I am concerned about the impact on some consumers of\nmortgages that become too costly, and the possible implications for lenders and markets. However, at this point, I do\n\n\fnot view this as likely to be a major issue to the overall New England economy. My sense is that Massachusetts and\nNew England will experience some sustained cooling in real estate markets, and some flattening of prices, but this trend\nis not likely to affect the region overly negatively, and likely not more than the nation as a whole.\nSo, if we are at all accurate, 2006 will be a year of solid growth, perhaps faster in the first half as Katrina rebuilding\noccurs and energy prices stabilize, and slower later on as hurricane-related fiscal stimulus ebbs and housing activity\ntapers off, but strong overall. There are risks to be sure, but as you know monetary policy is all about risk management.\nSo that’s the good news for the next year or so. Now I would like to look out in time a bit farther and talk about the\npotential consequences of running large federal budget and current account deficits. Let’s start with the federal budget\ndeficit, which reached $318 billion in 2005, a large and somewhat sobering number.\nTo begin with, it’s probably more informative to measure the deficit relative to the overall size of the economy’s\nproductive capacity or GDP. Just as a household can safely handle more debt as its income rises, the U.S. economy can\ngenerate the extra tax revenue needed to pay the interest on its debt without raising tax rates as long as national income\nis also growing in proportion. From this perspective, the budget situation seems less dire; the deficit was about 2.6\npercent of GDP in 2005, a decline over 2004 (when it was 3.6 percent of GDP) and relatively low as compared to 1983\n(when it was 6 percent of GDP).\nUnfortunately, several factors make today’s fiscal situa­tion much more serious than indicated by the current ratio of the\ndeficit to GDP. First, the deficit would be much larger, 4.1 percent for fiscal 2005, if it were not for a sizable surplus in\nSocial Security -- a surplus that is the direct result of the increase in payroll tax rates designed to prepare the Social\nSecurity system for the surge in benefit payments that will result as baby boomers retire. These surpluses have been\ndeposited into social insurance trust funds and accumulated in nonmarketable Treasury securities. In essence, the trust\nfunds are providing a loan to the rest of the federal government – a loan that will have to be paid back with interest as\nbaby boomers collect their Social Security benefits. The Social Security surplus is forecast to gradually diminish, and,\nbeginning in about 2018, Social Security will start to pay out more in ben­efits than it receives from payroll taxes. Once\nthis happens, Social Security will start exerting upward pressure on the unified federal budget deficit.\nThe situation for Medicare is similar and, potentially, even more serious. Although payroll taxes to cover Medicare\nexpenditures are also currently in surplus, over time Medicare spending is expected to increase more rapidly than related\ntax revenues, creating a deficit prob­lem that analysts see as potentially greater in size and more difficult to control than\nthat associated with Social Security.\nUnless something in this scenario changes, these forces will require a steep increase in government borrowing as\nexpenditures will greatly exceed tax receipts. The resulting rising deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio could pose challenges\nto the level of private investment in this country, and to future improvements in its standard of living.\nSo far, the political process has failed to enact measures that might credibly be expected to bring the budget back closer\nto balance. The budget deficits of the 1980s resulted in legislative actions that by the early 1990s moved toward\nreducing those deficits. Indeed by 1998 the federal budget was in surplus. Since then, however, a combination of tax\ncuts, and new spending on a wide range of efforts -- the Iraq war and post 9/11 security among them -- have created a\nnew deficit problem. A case can be made that the tax cuts of 2001 were well timed to facilitate the recovery from the\nrecession. Now actions similar to those of the 1980s and early 1990s are needed to bring about the fiscal discipline\nrequired to address the demographic challenges of the next decade.\nLet me now turn to our external, or current account deficit, which is estimated at $800 billion in 2005, or 6.5 percent of\nGDP. This is a large deficit for a major developed country, certainly measured by size alone, and in reference to GDP\nas well. The current account primarily reflects the difference between the value of the goods and services we sell\nabroad and the value of those we import. Running a current account deficit means that domestic spending exceeds what\nis produced in this country. It also means that we must borrow from abroad to cover the difference. Thus, the surging\nU.S. current account deficit has made us increasingly dependent on borrowing from abroad in recent years.\nThe two deficits, the federal fiscal deficit and the current account deficit are often referred to as “twins.” As my former\ncolleague Ned Gramlich has pointed out, they are not literally twins, but they certainly share a lot of DNA -- DNA in\n\n\fthe form of national savings. National savings is the sum of all private savings -- that is saving or dissaving by\nhouseholds and businesses -- and government saving or dissaving. When national savings are low, as has been the case\nrecently, with only business saving modestly in the black, either dependence on foreign savings increases, or national\ninvestment must decline. The growth in our current account deficit reflects the growing dependence of U.S. investment\non foreign savings.\nAlthough there is considerable controversy about when, and how, narrowing of the current account and federal budget\ndeficits will occur, there is a broad consensus that the projected growth in both deficits relative to GDP is not\nsustainable. We cannot continue to run a federal budget deficit that raises our debt-to-GDP ratio indefinitely, without\ndiminishing private investment through higher interest rates, thereby reducing productivity and long term growth.\nThe current account deficit is also not sustainable at its existing size and rate of growth. If the amount we must borrow\nfrom abroad to finance spending is rising faster than GDP, at some point paying our debts will eat into our standard of\nliving. As the U.S. issues ever larger amounts of debt, foreign purchasers would likely require higher interest rates to\ncontinue investing, threatening either investment levels or U.S growth, or both. Many argue that given the depth and\nliquidity of our markets, and the attractiveness of the U.S. as a place to invest, some level of U.S. current account deficit\nis sustainable. But even those who are sanguine about our current position are troubled about the future.\nHow to reduce the current account deficit is a matter of significant debate as well. By definition, it can only be reduced\nthrough some combi­nation of increased exports and decreased imports relative to GDP. But few if any of the paths to\ncurrent account reduction are cost free since, again, by definition, a slower pace of import growth suggests a slower\npace of U.S. output growth. Perhaps the closest to a “win-win” would entail stronger economic growth in our major\ntrading partners, leading to an increase in demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, achieving parity in the growth rates of our\nmajor trading partners and ourselves could go a long way toward a gradual and orderly reduction of the U.S. external\ndeficit. It would, however, require strong, self-sustaining domestic-led growth in our major trading partners, something\nthat has proven elusive, at least for the Euro-zone and Japan.\nIt is also true that the current account deficit would be reduced if foreigners decided they were no longer willing to\ninvest their U.S. dollars in our country -- in other words, they could stop lending to us to make up for our lack of\nnational savings. This could have serious consequences.   Indeed, when developing countries have run external deficits\nof this relative size the results have usually involved major financial and economic crises.\nOf course one should not make hasty comparisons between the United States and developing economies. The strength\nand resilience of our economy, and the fact that our external debt is largely in our own currency should help to ward off\nthe most significant negative consequences going forward. Moreover, the benefits of international trade accrue to both\nsides. U.S. consumers and businesses have benefited from buying foreign goods; foreigners have benefited as well from\naccess to our liquid markets to purchase debt and equity with a desirable balance of risk and return. Thus, it is in U.S.\ninterests, and in the interests of our major trading partners, to address trade imbalances in reasonable ways. But\nrec­ognizing this, how can policy help ensure such an outcome?\nThere are no easy answers here. Suffice it to say that policies aimed at increasing national savings are the best response\nto both rising fiscal and current account deficits. Given the expected waning of housing activity, consumers may well\nbegin to save more. To be sure, that would be a good thing but it won’t be enough. A great additional step would be to\nnarrow the prospective federal fiscal deficit -- that is, reduce government dissaving -- through bringing the federal\nbudget into balance. The federal deficit should be reined in before it begins to balloon as a share of GDP reflecting\ndemographic change. While this is not a perfect solution, and it has real near-term costs, in the end it may be the only\nway to engineer a gradual way out of our debt burdens.\nIn sum, the short-run picture is a good one. With another year of solid growth at home and around the world, the\neconomy will continue on a firm footing. The longer run poses challenges. One way to address these challenges is to\nincrease our level of national savings. Personal savings rates need to rise, but a credible start on reining in our fiscal\ndeficits is even more important. It won't be cost-free to be sure, but now is the time to start.\nRelated Links\n\n\f\f",

Minehan, President & Chief Executive Officer\nAllied Social Science Associations Meeting\nJanuary 6, 2006\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here today with my two distinguished fellow panelists, John Taylor and my colleague Richard\nFisher. Our topic – how monetary policymakers cope with uncertainty – is an important one given the impact that\nmonetary policy can have on growth and inflation in the short run, and price stability over the longer term. Almost by\ndefinition, central banks operate in an uncertain world. Monetary policy works with a lag -- a long and variable lag as\nthey say, though I wonder whether the reaction of financial markets in recent times may have made that lag somewhat\nshorter and perhaps less variable. Indeed, the significant moderation in economic volatility since the mid-80s, and the\nrecent incredible resilience of the U.S. economy to a wide range of challenges suggests uncertainty may be smaller now,\nthough the causes for these changes and how permanent they might be are matters of keen debate.\nNonetheless, making policy will always involve dealing with uncertainty as to both the economic outlook, and the effect\nof policy. How central banks manage this is critical to their success and critical to a variety of issues that have\nsurrounded the practice of central banking for most of the last quarter century. Given the uncertainty in the sources of\neconomic fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy to the economy, how can the public hold central banks\naccountable for their policy decisions in the way that it might like to, given the high stakes involved? Should\npolicymaking follow rules, and, thereby, reduce uncertainty about current and future policy? In the same vein, should\ncentral banks announce targets for inflation or other goals? And how should communication tools be used to convey\nwhat central banks are doing, or even what they are likely to do? I am not going to address all or even most of these\nquestions, but I mention them to give a sense of the pervasiveness of the issues related to uncertainty in monetary\npolicymaking.\nObviously, the views I will share with you about how policymakers cope with uncertainty are mine alone and not those\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston or the System more broadly. I have been a member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee for 12 years. As many of you know, I came to the presidency of the Boston Fed after a career spent in\nReserve Banks “making things work” broadly speaking, with plenty of experience helping to manage a variety of\nfinancial crises fraught with uncertainty. So I come to this topic as a practitioner, not a theoretician, though I have\nlearned a great deal from the tremendous scholarship that has been devoted to this general area over the years.\nUncertainty affecting the setting and conduct of monetary policy arises in two forms. The first of these involves macroeconomic and financial uncertainties that have the potential to affect the achievement of policy goals. This can involve\nsuch mundane matters as ambiguity about what current data are telling us about the future. It is never clear, for example,\nwhether a stronger or weaker than expected employment report will be sustained or reversed by later data, and that\nunknown could bear on the near-term policy decision. There are reasonably clear frameworks for thinking about this\nsort of uncertainty, for asking \"what-ifs\" and modeling the results. Of a more substantive nature are uncertainties related\nto trends that could affect the performance of the economy over the medium term. What is the potential for an oil shock\nto feed through into core inflation? What is the yield curve telling us? What is the potential for current account\nimbalances to affect the macro-economy in a significant and negative way? For such uncertainties, \"what-ifs\" and\nmodels may be less effective and a more judgmental approach to policy setting is required.\nThe second form of uncertainty stems from major shocks that have the potential to threaten financial stability. These are\nunusual to be sure, but not unknown in my 12 years. Such events can stem from several sources — more or less\ntraditional financial crises such as the Mexican and Russian debt problems or the LTCM crisis in the fall of 1998; the\n\n\fpotential for severe operational disruption as in the face of Y2K, and, most recently, and tragically, the geopolitical and\nhuman horror of 9/11. Here judgment becomes all-important. What actions are necessary to limit the spread of systemic\nproblems, and reduce the uncertainty that could paralyze markets?\nToday, I want to address how monetary policy copes with both types of uncertainty. I would also like to end with a few\nwords on the important and related issue of how central bank communication is evolving as a tool with which to both\nexplain the sources of uncertainty and reduce its level.\nCoping with uncertainty is both one of the most difficult aspects of being part of the FOMC, and the part that makes it\nso satisfying, as it involves an intellectual challenge as well as the performance of a public service. One highly\nimportant element in dealing with uncertainty is the strength of the Committee itself. In that regard, it is perhaps\nfashionable to deride committee decision making in general as bureaucratic and cumbersome. My view is that in\nsituations where there are many possible philosophical approaches and a lot at stake, a committee helps its members to\nboth see all aspects of the issue, and weigh the risks and costs of a particular decision. As with other vital institutions,\nlike the Supreme Court, there is value to a committee decision on policy versus one taken by a single executive.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee brings together a diverse group of skilled policymakers with a wide range of\nperspectives and experiences to address the policy choice. It ensures that policymakers benefit from a range of views\nand economic frameworks that represent information culled from a broad swath of the economy. And the Committee\nworks to create a consensus around policy choices – a consensus that, in my view, aids in communicating decisions.\nMoreover, the Committee’s regional membership helps to create public acceptance of the sometimes difficult choices\nthat are involved. So I view the structure and functioning of the Committee as a key first step to policy-making.\nWhen FOMC members gather to evaluate the information available and make a policy decision in the face of\nmacroeconomic and financial uncertainty, they have plenty of tools at their disposal: numerous indicators and measures\nof economic activity, arguably the best economic models, and forecasts to put that information into an organized\nstructure, and the lessons of history to guide them. All of this helps in assessing the current and prospective state of the\nU.S. economy.\nBut data and models aren’t perfect and they never will be. Important indicators are imperfectly measured. There are\nalways bands of uncertainty around the key relationships in the economy. And these relationships rarely stand still, as\nthe effects of changing demographics, institutions, and technological progress alter previous regularities in household\nand business decision-making. As incoming data are evaluated, decisions about whether surprises are an aberration, a\nmeasurement problem, a temporary blip, or a sign that it’s time to fundamentally reevaluate some aspect of an overall\neconomic framework figure into each policymaker's calculus.\nPerhaps the most important of recent examples has been the uncertainty around trend productivity growth and\ntechnological change. For about a twenty-year period ending in the mid 1990s, productivity growth averaged only about\n1.5 percent a year. As information technology and the power of computers expanded dramatically, many reasonably\nexpected the economy to exhibit an increase in productivity. Yet for a relatively long time, none could be observed in\nthe aggregate data, prompting Robert Solow’s famous quip: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the\nproductivity statistics”.\nBy the latter half of the '90s a substantial rise in measured productivity growth was seen and appreciated, first and\nforemost by Alan Greenspan. But there was a great deal of uncertainty about the source of the measured change. Was\nthe apparent jump in productivity a temporary response to short-run demand surges that brought unused capacity back\ninto production? Or was it likely to be permanent (or at least long-lived), reflecting the long-awaited fruits of years of\ninvestment in high-tech hardware, software, and process improvement? If the outsized surge was temporary, would\nproductivity then revert back to the lower rates of the 1970’s and 1980’s as the expansion aged, or would some of the\nincrease persist into the next century? The answers to these questions have important implications for sustainable\neconomic growth without inflation, and thus for monetary policy. In this case, productivity growth has continued for a\nrelatively long period of time, but at the time this was by no means certain, and it is no less uncertain today.\nHow have I as a policy maker learned to deal with such elements of uncertainty? In part, by setting a couple of standards\nfor myself, and, in part, by using common sense and judgment. My first priority has been to maintain a focus on the\n\n\fimportant long-run goal of the central bank – price stability. Actions that sacrifice that goal, or have a clear potential to\ndo so, will be quite costly. The hard won credibility of the central bank might suffer, with all that could mean for\ninflation expectations and price-setting in the economy. So – first things first. But, as we have seen, inflation —\nparticularly measures of core inflation — has been slow to build in recent years. Thus, for much of my time on the\nCommittee, my focus has been on striking the right balance between growth and price stability. How fast could the\neconomy grow without waking the inflation giant? How much is globalization affecting the sense businesses have of\ntheir pricing power, and how long could the productivity boom insulate the economy from pressures related to rising\ncompensation and unit labor costs? The answers to these questions and others were never patently obvious, so my\npreference has been to move with care, in steps that taken individually would have a small impact, but over time could\nbuild if that became necessary. So, for me, dealing with uncertainty means following two basic standards – “first things\nfirst” and \"move with care\"; that, to me, is the essence of a common sense approach to policy.\nAs an extension, it seems to me that a good policy has to be as informed as possible. This means depending on as many\nand as wide-ranging sources of information as one can. So my own view is that one should never rely on a single set of\nmeasures; look at multiple data sources for each economic process. And talk to or hear from as many people from as\nwide a variety of economic and geographic circumstances as you can. The structure of the Federal Reserve System and\nthe Committee provides many opportunities to hear from a diverse group of people, both within the FOMC and among\nthe Reserve Banks' varied outside contacts. Contacts and Committee members bring diverse backgrounds and\nexperiences from a host of sectors, viewpoints, and regions.\nCommon sense also suggests to me that uncertainty means there is always a vital role for judgment in setting monetary\npolicy. While the need for judgment will be most acute and obvious in times of systemic crisis, it always plays a key\nrole in setting policy. To me this involves an eclectic approach to economic theories, rather than a reliance on any one\nspecific doctrine; at times, aspects of all of them are useful. This does not mean that I do not appreciate the value of\n“policy rules”, most famously the “Taylor rule.” Such rules, which summarize the systematic response of monetary\npolicymakers over long periods of time, are extremely useful as benchmarks or guidelines when making policy. In their\nvarious forms, rules can help a policy maker understand what a rigorous application of historical responses to various\neconomic data might suggest for the stance of policy. This is instructive, but in my view not determinative, as a variety\nof things about the current economy may not necessarily be captured well by history or by simple rules. Finally, and in\nmany ways most importantly, one has to judge both the balance of risks in any given stance of policy and what the costs\nof policy action or inaction might be. \"What-if\" scenarios can be helpful here, as I noted earlier, but in the end it is the\npolicymaker's own sense of risks and costs that determine how he or she perceives the right policy choice. As Chairman\nGreenspan has noted, making monetary policy is about risk management, and, in my view, managing risks has an\nimportant judgmental component.\nThis brings us to the second combination of uncertainty and policy response that I noted earlier, the much more difficult\nuncertainty posed by unique, systemic financial shocks that threaten the very heart of the economy. Every once in a\nwhile -- actually more often than one would like -- the nation and policymakers at the Fed have to deal with an\nunexpected, major disruption. As I noted earlier, these have occurred with some frequency over the last 12 years, with\none of the most recent examples being 9/11.\nThe events of September 11, 2001 were certainly unexpected and raised enormous fears for the nation and its economy.\nWatching the World Trade Towers crumble on national television was psychologically devastating — and the physical\ndamage and security concerns closed the New York Stock Exchange and many firms with offices in lower Manhattan,\nwith effects threatening to ripple throughout the economy. How do policymakers deal with these most dramatic and\nultimately most threatening events?\nIn such extraordinary times, while the same standards of \"first things first\" and \"moving with care\" are important,\njudgment and timing become vital. Timeframes for action can be short and the pressure intense. The Committee can\nmeet by phone between meetings to discuss issues and make policy changes if needed, and this has been done a few\ntimes during my tenure. In such circumstances, it is even more important than usual to gather information from diverse\nsources and from multiple perspectives. For example, during the days immediately following 9/11, staff at the Boston\nFed were in touch with major market participants in the First District on a nearly round-the-clock basis, sorting out\nproblems and helping the financial system work again after that tragedy. Boston was far from unique here; such intense\n\n\factivity occurred at Reserve Banks around the country, with New York and Washington taking the lead as policymakers\ncoped with the aftermath of the tragedy.\nCrisis situations by definition imply that time is at a premium. Judgments need to be made about whether or not the\nsystem is in jeopardy, and making such judgments and assessing the probable outcomes is quite hard. The first and\nforemost important consideration for the Fed in these instances has to be the stability of the financial system. Knowing\nthat, the first response must be a consideration of whether heightened liquidity is needed so that financial markets can\nfunction more or less normally. If such a decision is made, the provision of liquidity has to be temporary, but it is the\nkey to market stability.\nIn the case of 9/11, the wholly appropriate decision of supplying extraordinary liquidity reflected the effect of the\ndestruction of significant market infrastructure and the potential for market gridlock. Reserve balances swelled by\nalmost $200 billion in the period following September 11th as the Fed flooded the markets with liquid assets. To offset\nthe impact of a lack of air transportation, Reserve Banks gave credit for check deposits without immediately charging\nthe payor, adding nearly $20 billion in reserves all by itself, and supported so-called “off-line” electronic transfers of\nfunds and securities well into the night to help settle markets. As the crisis subsided, the unneeded reserve balances were\nwithdrawn, but their presence was vital in stabilizing the situation.\nThe crisis also prompted a change in the stance of policy. At the time of the tragedy, the U.S. economy was already in\nthe midst of what turned out to be a mild recession, although it had not formally been classified as such at that time. The\nfederal funds rate had been cut seven times that year, taking it from 6 to 3.5 percent. In the face of the crisis, prospects\nfor real GDP declines in the fourth quarter were significant, raising real issues of economic strength. The FOMC’s\nresponse was to cut the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points, a decision made during a special telephone meeting\non the Monday of the following week, and announced the same day. Remarkably, the economy proved much stronger\nthan expected over the next several quarters, but at the time the possibility for lasting economic damage seemed very\nreal.\nFinally, let me say a word about how the FOMC has begun to use communication with markets as a way of minimizing\nuncertainty. Attitudes regarding communicating central bank policy changes have evolved considerably over the 30+\nyears I have worked in the Federal Reserve System, and I believe there can be no doubt this has been a good thing. Until\n1994, FOMC decisions were not made public until the publication of the minutes of the meeting, six to eight weeks\nafterward, although it was clear the market was quite adept at inferring the direction and size of funds rate changes\nwithin hours. Since that time, in several steps the Committee evolved to its present policy of announcing its action after\nevery meeting, disclosing the vote and any dissents, and publishing the minutes of the meeting after three weeks. In my\nview, this level of communication has helped the public understand Fed policy, and has been useful recently in assuring\njittery markets that policy accommodation could remain for “a considerable period”, and then be removed at “a\nmeasured pace”.\nIn a way, the last couple of years have been the exception that proves the rule about the uncertainty involved in setting\nmonetary policy -- there has been considerable economic uncertainty globally and in the U.S., but not much uncertainty\nabout the needed direction of U.S. monetary policy. Short-term interest rates needed to rise, but the question was when\nto begin, and how long to continue. While the Committee is still working on an answer to that last question, I believe the\noverall process -- including communicating as we did -- has had both advantages and perhaps raised some reasons for\ncaution. On the positive side, it has aided in a rather smooth transition from an economy functioning with lots of support\nfrom both monetary and fiscal policy, to one that appears to have solid, non-policy-driven, forward momentum, though\nthe smoothness of this transition likely owes something to the overall moderation in economic volatility I noted at the\nstart of my comments. In recent years, in part guided by statement language, markets have helped to keep financial\nconditions supportive of growth. The U.S. as an economic engine figured importantly in world-wide growth over the\nperiod as well.\nA possible reason to be cautious involves both the power communication can have and the certainty it can foster. It is\nclear that communication by policymakers, whether in the statement itself or in speeches or testimony, can be quite\npowerful. Even when carefully crafted, it risks the interpretation of a pre-commitment to action when that is not the\nintent. I recognize forward-looking language from a central bank can help to anchor markets, but, absent unusual\n\n\fcircumstances, I wonder whether the resulting sense of policy certainty that can be conveyed is appropriate given the\nfact that often the next move of the Committee is not a foregone conclusion. Is there a risk that such communication will\nlimit the flexibility of monetary policy setting? Or, conversely, could such communication produce policy inertia? I do\nnot know the answers to these questions but they do nag at me.\nAnd, in my view, we may be entering a period in which policy changes are even more dependent than they have been on\ncurrent readings of the economy, with all the uncertainty such readings can bring. So, as the Committee’s minutes have\nsuggested and its recent policy statement confirms, its communication is evolving. In that regard, I believe it will be\nimportant to consider how best to convey what the Committee did and why in the context of the uncertainty involved in\nfuture policy action. Of course, making such fine distinctions can be quite difficult particularly as markets now\nvigorously deconstruct every aspect of the Committee's policy statements.\nIn sum, policymaking always occurs surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty. I view the standards of focusing first on price\nstability, moving with care, and using common sense and judgment about risks as critical to making policy in such an\nenvironment. In extreme circumstances, calming markets and restoring confidence with an ample but temporary supply\nof liquidity is vital in addressing market uncertainty. Finally, I believe as FOMC communication evolves, as it\ninevitably will, policymakers should move carefully in recognition of the power such communication can have.\nRelated Links\n\n\f",
