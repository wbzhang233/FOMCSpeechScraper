Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJanuary 14, 2011\nRemarks at the New England Mortgage Expo,\nhosted by the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation and The Warren Group\n\nI’d like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak with you today. The\nbeginning of a new year is a good time to discuss the outlook for the economy. I will also try to\nanswer a couple of the key questions that most everyone seems to be asking about, in relation to\nthis recovery.*\nAs I’m sure you know, over the past several weeks we have been getting economic data\nconsistent with a somewhat happier new year. A recovery that has been anemic for the past year\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nand a half looks to be increasingly supported by private spending as 2011 begins. The Blue Chip\nforecast for 2011 has increased 4 tenths over the previous month, to 3.3 percent.\nAnd I am slightly more optimistic than the Blue Chip; my own forecast is for growth of\n3.5 to 4.0 percent over 2011. This is certainly an improvement, but – soberingly – would still\nleave the unemployment rate close to 9 percent at the end of this year, a rate far above anyone’s\nestimate of full employment.\nGiven the evidence of substantial excess capacity and a quite low core inflation rate, it is\nabsolutely appropriate that monetary policy – and indeed fiscal policy – have been deployed in a\nway that encourages a more robust recovery. Going forward, it is my view that monetary policy\nmust continue to focus on addressing both elements of the Fed’s mandate – price stability, and\ngrowth supporting a return to full employment in the medium term.\nToday I am going to focus on two questions that seem to be at the forefront of most\ndiscussions of the recovery.\nThe first question is, what role will housing play in the recovery? As the most interestsensitive component of gross domestic product (GDP), housing has traditionally been an\nimportant sector of the economy for generating recovery. I will be highlighting the fact that,\ndespite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing recovery, I expect housing will\nnot provide as much support to this recovery as it has in previous ones. My sense is that\nresidential investment, consumer durables, and services related to housing will be less robust\nthan is usual in many recoveries, thus playing a role in what I think will be only a gradual\nimprovement in the economy and employment.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nTo put it plainly, these housing-related headwinds are part of why I do not expect growth\ngreater than 4 percent this year. And while 4 percent is not terrible, at that rate it will still take a\nvery long time to get back to full employment.\nThe second key question is, how concerned should we all be about a flare-up in inflation\n– and aren’t the measures the Fed has taken inflationary? Many have expressed concern that\nFederal Reserve policy actions that expanded our balance sheet dramatically will cause inflation.\nI firmly believe that in the short run inflation is likely to remain quite low – and that in the longer\nterm we have the tools, and the steadfast commitment, to address inflationary pressures.\nIndeed, while monetary policy works with lags, I would note that it has been more than\ntwo years since the Fed’s balance sheet expanded dramatically. Since that time, core inflation\nhas fallen and core inflation measures using the CPI or PCE indexes are at something like 50\nyear lows.\nToday I will briefly address the role of the low inflation rate for the economy and\npolicymaking. In doing so, I will discuss why inflation concerns have not materialized to date,\nand why I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next several years.\n\nQuestion 1: Housing and the Economic Recovery\nThe economic recovery officially began in the third quarter of 2009, according to the\norganization responsible for dating our recessions – the National Bureau of Economic Research\n(NBER). Despite being a year and a half into the official recovery, the recovery period has been\nso tepid that there has been very little improvement in the percentage of the population employed\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n(see Figure 1). The percent of the population employed in December was 58.3, close to the low\nof this cycle and below the 59.3 percent employed in July of 2009, when the recovery officially\nstarted. For context, the number was around 63 percent when the recession began. The recent\nstability of the employment-to-population ratio reflects the poor labor market performance of the\ncurrent recovery. We are simply not generating enough jobs to reduce the number of\nunemployed persons. Nor are we, by the way, providing job opportunities for the so-called\n“discouraged workers” who have given up looking for work.\nWhat we call final sales – growth in GDP excluding inventory replenishment – has grown\nquite slowly over the past year and a half. Figure 2 shows that the growth to date has been\nsubstantially slower than during the 1982 recovery, and is tracking quite closely to the weak\nrecovery experienced in the early 2000s. As many economists anticipated, the recovery has been\ntepid given the fact that it comes in the wake of a collapse in a housing bubble with resulting\nfinancial market turmoil and disruption.\nThe largest GDP component is consumption, and consumption has not grown very\nquickly. As Figure 3 shows, in the current recovery, growth in consumption has been much\nslower than in the 1982 recovery and has, unfortunately, tracked the anemic initial recovery from\nthe 2001 recession. While the 2001 recession damaged many a household’s finances, through an\nabrupt decline in stock-market wealth, the current recovery has been hampered by households\ntrying to rebuild their finances given sharply diminished housing wealth in addition to declines in\nthe value of their other investments.\nWhile there have been concerns about business fixed investment, Figure 4 shows that\nthis component of GDP has grown quite well relative to the last two recoveries – although\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsomewhat slower than the 1982 recovery. Despite the concern over economic uncertainty voiced\nby many businesses, investment has been growing.\nThe real laggard in this recovery has been housing. While housing is a relatively small\ncomponent of GDP, it can be quite volatile – and often grows rapidly during an economic\nrecovery. In addition, purchases of appliances, home furnishings, and housing-related services\nare impacted by slowed housing activity. Given the problems that flow from the bursting of the\nhousing bubble, Figure 5 shows that residential fixed investment is roughly where it was at the\ntrough of the recession – and thus not providing its more usual contribution to growth in the\nearly stages of a recovery.\nJust how moribund the housing market has been is shown in Figure 6. Both housing\nstarts and building permits have leveled off, but are showing no signs of a significant recovery\nyet.\nInterest rates are quite low by historical standards, while the equity component of\nhousehold net worth is improving, as shown in Figure 7. And we have seen some positive\nimprovement in real disposable income. Given all that, one would normally anticipate that\nhousing would be improving.\nHowever, lower interest rates are only helpful if credit is available. Figure 8 shows that\nthe number of purchase loans to prime borrowers has been declining, while the subprime market\nis dormant.1 The left side of Figure 9 shows the distribution of all home-purchase loans by\ncredit score in 2006 (before the financial crisis) and in 2010.2 It is striking how the distribution\nof purchase mortgages has changed. Credit standards have tightened, as evidenced by a shift to\nborrowers with higher credit scores. Given what has happened to housing prices, and\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunemployment, lenders are presumably more cautious in lending. Far fewer loans are going to\nborrowers with credit scores below 625, and many more purchase loans are going to borrowers\nwith credit scores above 750. In 2006, about 15 percent of the purchase loans were to borrowers\nwith credit scores below 625, but by 2010, this fraction had fallen to only 3.5 percent.\nThe decline in loans to borrowers with sub-625 scores has not completely resulted from\nthe decline in subprime lending. The right side of the figure shows the credit-score distributions\namong prime loans, and a similar rightward shift in the distribution is apparent. From 2006 to\n2010, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with sub-625 credit scores fell from\n8.5 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, the share of prime purchase loans going to borrowers with\nscores above 750 rose from about 35 percent to about 41 percent.\nWhile I am certainly not advocating going back to the loose lending standards of, say,\n2006, I think we should be aware of how changes in the distribution have implications for the\nhousing recovery. In particular, I would suggest that current lending standards are another\nreason the housing sector’s role in the recovery is likely to be weaker than usual.\nIn addition to the challenge of availability of credit to borrowers with low credit ratings,\nhousing has another issue. Both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates are quite high, as\nshown in Figure 10 – although there has been recent improvement in these rates, and hopefully\nthe trend is now downward. High vacancy rates, of course, place downward pressure on home\nprices and rental rates, and serve as another headwind to a housing recovery.\nSo again, all in all and despite some improvement in factors fundamental to a housing\nrecovery, I expect that housing will not provide as much support to this recovery as it has in\nprevious ones.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nBut now I’d like to turn to the second question, and perhaps leave you feeling a bit less\ndiscouraged when we’re through.\n\nQuestion 2: Inflation, Policy, and the Economic Recovery\nA second key question involves the concerns about Fed actions stoking inflation. This\nquestion is not a distinct and separate issue from the one we just discussed – the strength of the\nrecovery. In fact they are crucially related. If housing-related growth is not going to boost the\nrecovery this time around, we may need policy – particularly monetary policy – to continue\nplaying a stimulative role.\nBut it is important to look at possible costs of stimulative policy, as well as benefits. If\ninflation were to become a problem that would certainly fall in the costs column. But if analysis\nsuggests that inflation is not likely to be a problem, then we can more comfortably align policy to\ncontinue supporting the recovery.\nSome observers and analysts have voiced great concern that the nascent economic\nrecovery, combined with the actions of the Federal Reserve that have expanded its balance sheet,\nwill lead to significant inflation. However, Figure 11 provides a variety of different measures of\ncore inflation; core CPI, core PCE, trimmed core CPI and trimmed core PCE. It is striking how\nmuch all four series have declined. In fact many of these series are at their historical lows.\nFigure 12 shows the different measures of core inflation in the top panel, and the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet in the bottom panel. In the fall of 2008, the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet expanded significantly – but that period also corresponds to the emergence of disinflation\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n(a reduction in the inflation rate) in the U.S. While monetary policy works with lags, why has\nthe unprecedented increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet corresponded with continued\nsignificant disinflation? The answer is that both have been reacting to an unprecedented\nfinancial shock, which resulted in significant excess capacity in the economy.\nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases assets and expands its balance sheet, it necessarily\ninjects more reserves into the banking system. The key question is what banks do with those\nreserves. Reserves held by the banking system that are not used to provide credit to businesses\nwill have little bearing on either real spending or inflation. The 2009 line in Figure 13 shows\nthat the expansion of bank reserves has not generated increases in lending. As with the 1991\nrecovery, where a credit crunch impeded expansion of bank lending, there has not been an\nexpansion of lending during this recovery. This is particularly noticeable if we look at business\nlending, in Figure 14. Commercial and industrial loans are substantially lower than at the\nrecession trough.\nOf course, those who worry about the inflationary consequences of our balance sheet may\nbe looking to the future. As the economy improves, banks may use their reserves to rapidly\nexpand business lending – increasing economic activity and putting upward pressure on\ninflation. But as Chairman Bernanke has emphasized, the Federal Reserve has at its disposal a\nvariety of tools that will allow it to remove reserves from the banking system once economic\nconditions get closer to normal. Thus the fear that our large balance sheet and the large stock of\nreserves in the banking system will cause inflation – either now or down the road – seems\nmisplaced to me.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nWhile we have been experiencing disinflation generally, it is not the case for all prices.\nAs Figure 15 shows, some prices have risen rapidly. Energy prices in particular have been\nrising, in response to robust growth in emerging markets. But outside of energy prices, most\nprices have shown little increase, and in fact a number of the major categories in the CPI index\nhave experienced declines in prices.\nTo be clear, the Fed certainly cares about increases in energy prices, for two reasons.\nFirst, higher energy prices could potentially bring about long-lasting increases in the overall\ninflation rate. The Fed therefore monitors energy prices closely, given our mandate to keep\noverall inflation low and stable. Second, rising energy prices act as a tax on households and\nbusinesses, who often find it difficult to reduce their consumption of energy in the short run.3\nWith regard to the first concern, our research suggests that the lasting effect of energy\nprices on overall inflation has been surprisingly small in recent years. For evidence, consider the\nenormous surges in oil prices in mid-2008, which were followed by significant declines in core\ninflation, as I mentioned earlier.\nThe second concern remains, however. In sum, my primary concern about rising energy\nprices is not so much that they will lead to higher inflation, but that they will subtract from\nhousehold income and thus weaken the economy.\nFinancial markets are also not expecting sharply higher rates of inflation. The difference\nbetween the 10 year Treasury rate and the 10 year inflation-protected Treasury security (TIPS)\nrate provides a measure of the expected average inflation rate over the next decade. As shown in\nFigure 16, the average expected inflation rate by this measure is still below what the markets\nexpected prior to the recession and the necessary expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nConcluding Observations\nThankfully, we are seeing signs that the economy is experiencing a more self-sustaining\nrecovery. However, it is important not to lose sight of how much excess capacity remains. It is\nlikely to take at least four years to return to full employment from the current unemployment rate\nof 9.4 percent. It is also likely that measures of core inflation will remain well below 2 percent\nover the same period. This suggests that the signs of improvement we have seen so far are not\nworrisome, but are most welcome. A sustained period of the economy growing well above its\npotential – not just for a few quarters – is exactly what we need.\nThe current level of accommodation from monetary and fiscal policy is appropriate.\nHowever, once the economy has significantly improved, both fiscal and monetary policy will\nneed to be much less accommodative. Getting this balance right will be one of the main policy\nchallenges over the next several years. I am confident that the Fed’s Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) will meet the challenge.\nFinally, I’d like to note that even with some early signs of economic improvement, a\nnumber of risks remain. As I have highlighted today, the housing market remains fragile and is\nnot likely to contribute to economic recovery in its traditional way – and this is part of why I do\nnot expect growth to exceed 4 percent in 2011. Furthermore, in many areas of the country the\nimpaired balance sheets of borrowers, high foreclosures, and high vacancy rates imply a long\ntime before local housing markets normalize. State and local governments remain significantly\nchallenged by the aftershocks of the financial crisis and recession. And many state and local\ngovernments continue to have both short-run and long-run fiscal challenges.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinally, the large fiscal deficits of many governments accrued during the recession will\nneed to be addressed. And as Figure 17 shows, financial markets are concerned that many\ncountries will be forced to make very painful fiscal choices – in economies with already\nsignificant challenges – or risk default.\nYet while risks like these remain, the economy is in a much better place than it was one\nor two years ago. Fiscal and monetary policy responded aggressively, and in my view\nappropriately, to avoid what would have been a much more severe outcome, absent action.\nThere will be a time when these aggressive actions need to be reversed, but first we need\nto get the economy on a much more solid footing. Even with a relatively robust recovery, it will\ntake several years before we attain full employment and an inflation rate close to a long-run\nexpectation of 2 percent. Taken together there has been clear room for – and indeed an\nimperative for – policy actions like those the Federal Reserve has been pursuing.4 Going\nforward our focus must be on policies that return the economy to a place that meets both\nelements of the Fed’s mandate.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nFigures 8 and 9 are based on data from McDash Analytics LLC, a subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.\nThe McDash data contain loan-level data from mortgage servicers, and cover more than half of all outstanding\nmortgages in the United States. The number of servicers contributing to the McDash dataset is growing over time,\nso the decline in purchase loans depicted in Figure 8 probably understates the true decline in lending to a small\nextent. The 2010 distributions reflect data through November 2010.\n2\n\nThe share of subprime loans in the McDash data is generally smaller than the true subprime share of U.S.\nmortgages. To create Figure 9, subprime loans in the McDash data were “upweighted,” so that the adjusted\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Friday, January 14, 2011 at 1:15 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nsubprime share matches the true subprime share in a benchmark year (2006). The benchmark figure used for the\nweighting is based on the top panel of Figure 1B in Mayer and Pence (2008): “Subprime Mortgages: What, Where\nand to Whom?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series Paper No. 2008-29, Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System – available on the Board of Governors website at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/PUBS/FEDS/2008/200829/200829pap.pdf\n3\n\nThe first effect would lead Fed policy to be slightly less accommodative while the latter effect would lead it to be\nslightly more accommodative.\n\n4\n\nFor additional perspective, see Vice Chair Janet Yellen’s remarks of January 10, where she discusses the rationale,\ndesign, and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s asset-purchase program; and concerns about inflation or adverse\nimbalances resulting.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Boston University conference on\nThe State of Financial Reform\n(panel on Lessons Learned from the Global\nFinancial Meltdown)\nFebruary 28, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nGood morning. I’d like to thank Boston University and all the conference organizers,\nparticularly Larry Kotlikoff, for the opportunity to be here to discuss lessons learned from the\nglobal financial meltdown.*\nEveryone knows that the past three years have been a particularly difficult period for\nglobal financial market stability and for the global economy. The financial crisis clearly showed\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nthe dramatic impact that financial problems can have on the real economy. And in spite of a fair\namount of focus on financial stability prior to the crisis, events highlighted that the private and\npublic sectors both here and abroad were not fully prepared for the kinds of financial shocks we\nexperienced.\nToday I’d like to discuss the role of what I call “financial myths” in creating financial\ncrises. By financial myths I mean the beliefs, held by most market participants and by\nregulators, that certain outcomes are so unlikely to occur that they can basically be ignored –\nessentially that low probability events, based on historical experience, can be reclassified as zero\nprobability events. When these sorts of widespread assumptions – these financial myths – turn\nout to be wrong, most financial-market participants find themselves poorly positioned for the\nresulting shocks. The result is insolvency of groups of firms and substantial uncertainty –\nuncertainty about the exposure of many firms to direct losses, or to indirect losses created by\ntheir counterparty exposure to other firms that suffer direct losses.\nThese so-called financial myths are not unique to this time period, or to this country. I\nwould like to briefly mention two among the numerous examples from recent history – examples\nwhere financial myths were important in helping to create a potential crisis. The first example\ninvolves the assumption of many in Japan that real estate prices could not fall in the late 1980s.\nThe second involves the assumption, in the late 1990s, that the Internet had completely changed\nhow we should think about company valuation.\nI will then briefly mention four financial myths that played critical roles in the recent\nfinancial crisis. These include the following assumptions:\n•\n\nthat a diversified portfolio of US real estate had little risk of falling in value;\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n•\n\nthat Triple-A rated securities based on mortgages were so well protected by the\nstructure of the securitization that they posed little risk even if real estate prices did\nfall;\n\n•\n\nthat the evolution of many financial institutions to an “originate to distribute” model\nof lending and securitization meant there was little risk exposure to declining real\nestate prices; and,\n\n•\n\nthat there was little risk of a “run” on organizations like investment banks that relied\non short-term, collateralized borrowing.\n\nThen to conclude I’d like to briefly mention what we can and must do to reduce the risks\nresulting from these sorts of financial myths, going forward. I believe that financial stability\nwill, in the future, be better served as we implement some of the protections afforded by the\nDodd-Frank Act; but I also suspect that doing better at protecting against various financial myths\nultimately requires a cultural change. As a discipline, risk management has been too willing to\naccept that historical statistical relationships will be stable. Ideally, risk management practices\nwould lead us to ask things like “What will happen if the historical relationship breaks down?”\nand “What assumptions would need to change for them to break down?”\nAlso, I will touch on the fact that challenging assumptions and understanding the risk\ninherent in relying solely on historical experience should not be the responsibility of the risk\nmanager alone. These things also need to be better ingrained in CEOs, members of boards of\ndirectors, and regulators. I believe we need to do a much better job of using so-called stress tests\nto challenge commonly held views, so that boards of directors and regulators of firms better\nunderstand the fundamental drivers of risks in organizations and in the financial system.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nFinancial Myths in Recent History\nLet me look back to the time period before the most recent crisis and share two examples\nof financial myths – and, unfortunately, their messy demise. And I would emphasize that these\nare just two of many examples of the phenomenon.\nFirst, I’ll note that during the late 1980s, New England began to experience substantial\ndeclines in residential and commercial real estate prices. My research at that time at the Boston\nFed was focused on how problems at financial institutions could disrupt credit availability.\nInterestingly, in 1989 I was visited by a variety of Japanese academics and government officials.\nThey wanted to understand how we had missed the signs of an overheating real estate market.\nAs Figure 1 indicates, it was shall we say an interesting time for researchers from Japan\nto ask such a question. However, when I inquired about the rapid increase in real estate prices in\ntheir country, I always received the same answer – Japan is an island nation and had limited\nbuildable lots, and that prevented real estate prices from declining. This view was very widely\nheld. However, as you can see in Figure 2, that widely held financial myth was soon shattered.\nUnfortunately, the result of this belief was eventually the crippling of some of the world’s largest\nfinancial institutions, a long period of subpar economic growth in Japan, and eventually a\nproblematic deflation that Japan struggles with to this day.\nA second example is provided by the growth of the Internet, and in particular the growth\nin “dot-com” stock valuations, in the late 1990s. As Figure 3 shows, there was a substantial runup in stock valuations during this period. At the time I had conversations with a variety of\nfinancial professionals in Boston who made the argument that traditional valuation measures no\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nlonger applied. The view assumed by many was that valuation of firms should be based on\nclicks of a computer mouse rather than earnings, either current or expected in the future.\nAs Figure 4 shows, such enthusiasm for a new way of valuing companies was shortlived. But importantly, the substantial decline in Internet-related stocks did not create a financial\ncrisis. Many of the positions were equity financed – so, while significant wealth was lost,\nfinancial institutions and financial markets did not suffer severe repercussions. That loss in\nwealth helped ignite the 2001 recession, but it was a much more mild downturn than the one we\nhave experienced of late. With the financial infrastructure not significantly damaged, the impact\nwas much less severe than if individuals and firms had taken highly leveraged positions.\n\nFinancial Myths in the Recent Crisis\nNow I’d like to describe, and present some charts that illustrate, four financial myths that\nplayed a role in the recent crisis.\n\nMyth 1 – Diversification eliminated the risk of declines in residential real estate holdings\nDespite the experience of Japan’s real estate in the 1990s, and substantial declines in real\nestate prices in many regions of the United States throughout history, many commentators argued\nthat a significant, widespread housing-price decline in a country as large and varied as the United\nStates had not happened historically and was very unlikely to occur.\nThat logic was based on what you see in Figure 5, which highlights that there had been\nsignificant declines in some regions of the country – but the declines were coincident with\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nincreases elsewhere. As Figure 6 shows, there had not been recent, sustained declines in\nnational real estate prices. This observation, combined with the increased securitization of real\nestate into diversified national portfolios, gave buyers – and those rating the securitizations –\nconfidence that the “real estate cycle risk” was substantially mitigated through diversification.\nBut, as Figure 7 shows, the assumption that a geographically diversified portfolio of real\nestate assets would avoid price declines proved wrong. While prices nationally had not\nexperienced a substantial decline in the past, for three years the U.S. has experienced substantial\nand sustained declines in prices.\nSome of my colleagues point out, probably appropriately, that given the historical data\nthe failure to anticipate nationwide house prices falling is largely understandable. It was\ncertainly very widespread. What may be more surprising is that in the 2005 timeframe, when\nmany were expecting house prices to slow down or flatten, there was not much by way of risk\nmitigation undertaken.\n\nMyth 2 – Triple-A mortgage securities carried little risk\nThe securitization market – that is, the market for securities based on various slices of\npooled mortgages – grew dramatically over the past decade. One reason for the growth in\nsecuritization was investor interest in, and demand for, securities with little credit risk but returns\nabove those of Treasuries.\nMany buyers of such securities felt sure of two things. First, that national real estate\nprices were quite unlikely to fall – in other words, our Myth 1. Second, that even in the highly\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nunlikely event that the price of a national portfolio did fall, they would be protected by the\nstructure of the securitization. Securitizations were structured so that any losses were first borne\nby lower-rated securities built from the pool of underlying mortgages. Given the structure, the\nassumption was that lower-valued securities would take all potential losses if borrowers\ndefaulted. Many – but not all, of course1 -- assumed that home-price declines and related\ndefaults would have to be very extreme before the highest rated, Triple-A securities were\nimpacted. Under this assumption these securities fully deserved the Triple-A rating given by the\nrating agencies.\nI should note that making this assumption about Triple-A rated mortgage backed\nsecurities (MBSs) proved less problematic than making this assumption about the recombined\nlower tranches of mortgage-backed securities that were billed as Triple-A rated collateralized\ndebt obligations (CDOs). 2 But many investors focused not on the security’s underlying\ncomponents, merely on the ratings.\nFigure 8 shows that Triple-A securities remained at par values as the securitization boom\ngathered steam. However, Figure 9 shows that when the severity of the decline in house prices\nmanifested itself, even the Triple-A rated mortgage securities collapsed in value. The\ncombination of illiquidity, growing concerns with the real estate market, and ebbing confidence\nin the ratings resulted in dramatic declines in the pricing of Triple-A securities as the financial\ncrisis worsened.3\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMyth 3 - The “originate to distribute” model limited the balance-sheet risk of banks\nOver the decade preceding the crisis, large commercial and investment banks had become\nincreasingly involved in securitizing mortgage assets. They argued that this provided a steady\nstream of fee income but generated little risk for the bank. While they packaged mortgages, they\nwere not retaining the risk in their own portfolio – instead, the risk was taken by those that\npurchased the mortgage securities, particularly the lower-rated mortgage securities.\nWhat was frequently ignored by many was the rapid growth of Triple-A mortgage\nsecurities holdings elsewhere within the banks, as well as in off balance sheet structures. While\nthese off balance sheet structures were considered separate entities, banks found the potential\nreputational risk of not supporting their sponsored off balance sheet risk sufficiently great that\nmany ended up supporting these off balance sheet structures. In a sense, “originate to distribute”\nwas, in practice, something more like “originate to hold, loosely, somewhat off to the side.4”\nIn addition, risk managers, bank management, and regulators were sufficiently lulled by\nMyths 1 and 2 to develop their faith in Myth 3. The unfortunate result was that these banks were\nnot as protected from falling housing prices as many had assumed, and this contributed to the\nsubstantial decline in stock prices and the need for government support for many of these large\nfinancial intermediaries.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nMyth 4 – Investment banks were not subject to runs, because their liabilities were\ncollateralized\nThere has long been an understanding, and indeed a regulatory presumption, that banks\ncould be subject to “runs,” resulting in a need for both deposit insurance and a heavily regulated\nenvironment to reduce that risk. At the same time, it had largely been presumed that investment\nbanks were better protected against such runs. While the balance sheets of investment banks had\nsubstantial short-term liabilities, many of them were collateralized. Investment banks would buy\nlonger-term securities but finance them with short-term borrowing (using repurchase\nagreements). It was assumed that because there was collateral backing up the loans, borrowers\nwere protected and would not run.\nFinancing securities with short-term borrowing allowed investment banks to substantially\nexpand their balance sheets, as shown in Figure 10. However, the lenders in this market were\nother banks, money-market funds, and hedge funds. As questions about the value of the\ncollateral became more prominent, and the solvency and liquidity of investment banks became a\ngreater concern, many short-term lenders abandoned the market. Figure 11 shows the dramatic\nchange that occurred. The inability to finance large securities holdings made the traditional\nmodel of investment banking unsustainable, and this contributed to the failure of investment\nbanks and the merger under duress, or conversion to bank holding companies, of others.\n\nWhat Can We Do about Financial Myths, Going Forward?\nWe plumb this history to help us understand what we can do about financial myths, going\nforward, and how we can avoid their damaging impact.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nAs the previous slides have shown, taking too much confidence in historical data\nrepeating in the future can be dangerous – to the financial health of institutions and the financial\nsystem. That said, we are probably not likely to see a sea-change in the tendency for\noverconfidence in and reliance on recent statistical regularities.\nHowever, there are a variety of market participants that could better protect their own\ninterests – and the financial system – if they spend more time understanding the key assumptions\nbeing made in financial modeling, and have a clearer understanding of what could happen if\nthose assumptions were invalid. Properly done, stress testing should provide valuable\ninformation to organizations on key risk drivers. This needs to be more than feeding a handful of\nmacroeconomic assumptions into a model. It requires an understanding of the events that could\nlead to that macroeconomic outcome, and what other indirect effects might be likely to occur.\nWho should be responsible for regular, thoughtful stress testing? Risk managers, CEOs,\nand boards of directors should all understand key risk drivers – and should consider whether a\nstress scenario is sufficiently severe, and whether the direct and indirect effects are reasonably\ncaptured. Rating agencies and stock analysts should be increasingly demanding better quality\nstress tests, and that the results be made available to them. Finally, regulators should be able to\ncompare and contrast the quality of stress tests across organizations and hold accountable those\norganizations that are not keeping up with their peers.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, challenging assumptions and understanding risks should not\nonly be the responsibility of the risk manager. These things also need to be better ingrained in\nCEOs, members of boards of directors, and regulators.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\nOperationalizing this point is not going to be easy, but it is critical. At a fundamental\nlevel, debunking a myth requires individuals to go against strongly and widely held beliefs, to\nconvince decision-makers, and to build consensus. For this to happen we may need significant\nchanges in the governance of risk management at banks and other parties in the financial system.\nPut more plainly, we need to think about an environment where those in the position of most\ninfluence have the incentive to “poke holes” in myths via robust stress tests, and not the\nincentives to override their risk managers when the stress-test implications are not to their liking,\nor risk a near-term loss of clients or market share.\n\nConcluding Observations\nNew financial myths are regularly created. In closing, I will just speculate on where\nsome may exist that interested parties should be exploring, now.\n\n•\n\nPotential Myth 1 – Sovereign debt problems will not be disruptive to the world\neconomy. Not long ago, the sovereign debt problems were viewed as manageable\nand confined to one country. However, as interest rate spreads have widened – as\nshown in Figure 12 – investors are highlighting that problems in many countries have\nyet to be resolved. While I believe the most likely outcome is that there are no\nserious disruptions, interested parties should diligently consider scenarios that could\nbe disruptive, involving various countries.\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, February 28, 2011 at 8:50 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY*\n\n•\n\nPotential Myth 2 – State and local financing problems will not be disruptive to the national\neconomy.\n\nWhile much attention has been given to problems in state and local\n\nfinances, it is generally assumed that the capacity exists to resolve these problems.\nWhile I expect these issues will be resolved without widespread or cascading\nproblems, we should consider what scenarios could emerge if political impasses result\nin more disruptive outcomes.\n\nThese are just two of many potential scenarios that are worth exploring. However, I\nwould add that the recent financial crisis highlighted that unlikely events can happen, and when\nthey do, the outcomes can be quite costly for everyone. So the need for better risk management\nis clear. Fortunately, the opportunity is there as well.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nBoston Fed researchers note some examples of contrary analysis of Subprime ABS structures written in\n2005 suggesting vulnerability to even a 5 percent fall in house prices.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nA Look Inside\na Key Economic Debate:\nHow Should Monetary Policy Respond\nto Price Increases Driven by\nSupply Shocks?\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks to the Massachusetts Chapter of\nNAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate\nDevelopment Association\nMay 4, 2011\n\nI would like to thank David Begelfer and his colleagues at NAIOP Massachusetts for\ninviting me to join you today to discuss the economy and monetary policy.\nI am happy that financial markets and the economy have made significant progress since\nthe depths of the financial crisis, but I am far less happy that the recovery to date has been so\nundesirably slow and anemic. In my reading of economic history this is, unfortunately, typical\nof economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial disruptions.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThe debate I’d like to focus on today is the one over the likely impact of recent increases\nin the prices of food and energy, and how monetary policy should respond.* The Fed’s policy\nstance, as you know, is currently very accommodative – a stance that I believe is appropriate\ngiven the tentative recovery and still-high unemployment. But with food and energy prices\nrising, some observers think the Fed should shift its stance to less accommodation – slowing\neconomic growth now to ensure we don’t have undesirably high inflation in the future – even\nthough current measures of core inflation (that is, inflation omitting volatile food and energy\nprices) remain low by historical standards.\nAs the recovery continues – albeit slowly – several events have occurred that further\ncomplicate the outlook for inflation and real economic activity. Political upheaval in the Middle\nEast has contributed to sharply higher oil prices. Severe weather has reduced harvests from\nRussia to Australia, causing higher prices for many agricultural products. And Japan’s tragic\nearthquake and tsunami caused not only terrible loss of life, but also disruption to a supply chain\nthat is increasingly global.\nSo today I would like to discuss how monetary policy should react when the economy is\nbuffeted by a series of these so-called “supply shocks.” I’d like to just highlight my major points\nbefore getting into the data and analysis that underpin my perspective.\nFirst, I want to explain that while I will be making distinctions in this talk between socalled “core” and overall or total measures of inflation, we at the Federal Reserve look at all\nprices, including food and energy prices, when developing U.S. monetary policy. While we\n\n*\n\nOf course, the views I express today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC).\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\noften use core measures as a guide to where overall inflation is most likely to go, our goal is to\nstabilize overall inflation.\nAllow me to preview one of my conclusions. Because my analysis suggests that recent\nfood and oil price increases have their roots in concerns about wheat harvests in Russia and oil\nproduction in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to\nrespond to these disruptions. While many observers see food and energy prices rising and\nassume the Fed should tighten policy – raise the cost of money and credit – to head off inflation,\nI would suggest taking a step back and recognizing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do\nnothing to stabilize Libyan oil production, reduce uncertainty about political stability in the rest\nof the Middle East, or increase the wheat harvest in Russia.\nIn fact, tightening monetary policy solely in response to contractionary supply shocks\nwould likely make the impact of the shocks worse for households and businesses. To see why\nthis is so, it is important to keep in mind how supply shocks affect the economy.1\nFirst, supply shocks can lead to increases in food and energy prices that slow economic\ngrowth. For example, because a person’s need to drive may not be very flexible, spending on\ngas consumes a bigger portion of their budget. So an oil shock tends to force consumers to\nreduce their spending on other goods and services as they absorb higher oil costs.2\nSecond, while the prices of goods directly affected by the supply disruption increase,\nother prices in the marketplace may be unaffected – at least initially. If the supply shock\ninvolves food or energy, this dynamic causes measures of total inflation to rise, but does not\nhave a large impact on what economists call core inflation – which excludes the volatile food\nand energy sectors. But in the longer-run, the impact of the supply shock on the prices of other\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ngoods will depend importantly on how inflation expectations respond to the shock. If people\nexpect that food and energy prices will stabilize – in other words, that the price shock will be\ntemporary – and do not believe that the central bank will allow any long-run effect on inflation,\nthen the disruption to total inflation will likely be temporary and the total inflation rate will\neventually converge with the lower core inflation rate. Since 1986, this has largely been what\nhappened when we experienced these types of supply shocks – as I’ll illustrate in a moment with\nsome charts.\nAlternatively, if expectations of inflation do rise in response to the supply shock, then\n(nominal) wages and salaries across the economy will be pressured to increase over time to keep\npace. If that happens, the supply shock could affect prices throughout the economy – not just\nthose that that were part of the initial supply shock. In this case, the core rate of inflation rises to\nconverge with the higher measure of total inflation. This was the U.S. experience in the 1970s,\nfor reasons I’ll discuss in a moment.\nWe at the Fed need to very closely monitor the data to make sure that inflation remains\ncontained. And we will. But as I believe I will demonstrate this morning, the most likely result\nis that these supply shocks cause slower growth in the near term while having only a modest\neffect on longer-term inflation rates – which has been the U.S. experience since 1986.\nUnemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 percent, and I anticipate a slower return to\nfull employment than we would have experienced absent these supply shocks. With the core\ninflation rate over the prior year at a little above 1 percent, I anticipate only a gradual return of\ncore and total inflation rates to something like our consensus “stable” rate of about 2 percent,\nover the medium term.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIf the economic data continue to support this outlook then the current, accommodative\nstance of monetary policy is appropriate, and can remain in place and continue to support\neconomic growth – so that we continue to make progress toward our goals of returning to full\nemployment and a sustainable long-run inflation rate – the two elements of the Federal Reserve’s\ndual mandate from Congress.\n\nThe Impact of Recent Supply Shocks\nNow that you know my basic take on this key – and current – economic debate, allow me\nto flesh out my perspective with the supporting data and analysis. The full impact of the recent\nshocks to supply that I mentioned at the outset will likely emerge over time. But clearly there\nhave been significant increases in a variety of food and energy prices. As Figure 1 illustrates,\nthe recent turmoil in the Middle East has contributed to a significant increase in oil prices, which\nhave risen to over $100 a barrel. This is well above the average of nearly $80 a barrel\nexperienced over 2010, but at the same time still well below the peak of $146 a barrel that\noccurred in mid July, 2008.\nThe recent volatility in oil prices, as the chart shows, is quite striking. Sharp increases\nhave been followed by sharp decreases. This is one reason we may not want to overreact to price\nchanges – they could be transitory.\nFigure 2 shows the movements in oil prices – their percent change from a year earlier, in\nthe top line – relative to the change in compensation (the lower line), since 2000. Oil prices have\nrisen recently, but based on the history captured in this chart, one would not expect much of a\nresponse in wages and salaries. This, of course, is one reason why consumers feel worse off\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nafter an oil supply shock. Prices at gas stations in Massachusetts are now around $4.00 a gallon,\nyet most people’s need to drive cars has not changed much if at all. So income available for\nbuying other goods and services has been squeezed by the increase in oil prices.3\nSome softness in measures of consumer confidence suggests that consumers tend to be\nless confident about the future when oil prices rise. If consumers pull back spending as a result\nof a supply shock, it has the potential to be a drag on the economy. The Boston Fed’s statistical\nmodeling suggests that a $20 increase in the price of a barrel of oil will shave roughly four-tenths\nof a percentage point off the rate of economic growth over two years, and cause the\nunemployment rate to be roughly two-tenths of a percentage point higher than it would be absent\nthe oil shock. While this is certainly not enough to completely stop the recovery, it does imply a\nslowing down of its pace.\nOil is not the only commodity to experience price increases of late. A variety of\nagricultural prices have also increased. For example, Figure 3 shows the movement of wheat\nprices over the last decade. Droughts in Russia, flooding in Australia, and increased demand in\nemerging markets have all placed upward pressure on wheat prices.\nAs with oil prices, higher food prices appear to be responding to supply and demand\nfeatures of this market – and these types of price changes cannot be offset by monetary policy. It\ngoes without saying that monetary policy cannot alter the supply of oil from volatile parts of the\nworld, nor weather conditions in countries that are major exporters of agricultural products.\nMonetary policy can have a role in insuring that relative price changes do not alter inflation\nexpectations. Rising inflation expectations could make it difficult to achieve a moderate and\nacceptable inflation rate over the medium term.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHistorical Experience with Supply Shocks\nSupply shocks are not unique to this period. However, the evidence shows that the\neconomic impact of supply shocks on inflation has changed over time – actually quite\ndramatically. Figure 4 shows the inflation rate (total inflation and core, which again excludes\nfood and energy) since 1970. What is striking is the way the behavior of the two series differed\nin the 1970 to 1985 period versus the period from 1986 to the present. The interplay of core and\ntotal inflation is very, very different in the more recent period than it was in the former.\nI realize that delving into topics like total and core inflation can seem a bit abstract. So\nlet me bring in something a bit straightforward – energy prices and inflation. Figure 5 shows the\nprofound effect that energy prices had in the 1970s on core inflation. In the 1970s the lines\nmove up and down together as core inflation increased with energy prices. That is why my\nearlier chart shows core and total inflation moving so closely in that era. But since 1986,\ndramatic movements in energy prices have not affected core prices.\nMy next two figures look at each period separately. Figure 6 shows that for much of that\nearlier period, inflation rates were much higher than they are currently. From 1970 to 1985,\ninflation was quite volatile – with total inflation (measured by the all-items Consumer Price\nIndex or CPI) peaking at almost 15 percent, in 1980. The key observation is that during this\nperiod, increases in core inflation tended to follow increases in total inflation (which includes\nfood and energy). The oil and food price increases “pulled” core inflation.\nIn contrast, Figure 7 shows the total and core inflation rates since 1986. During this\nperiod, inflation has been lower and less volatile. And unlike in the earlier period, core inflation\ndoes not follow or gravitate to the level of total inflation. Total inflation jumps up and down as\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nfood and energy prices live up to their reputation for volatility. The spikes are tough on\nhouseholds, to be sure. But importantly, total inflation eventually gravitates to the core measure\nthat excludes food and energy. Core inflation stays “moored.”\nFigure 8 represents another way to use the available data to explore this relationship. It\ntoo shows that the increases in total inflation in recent years have generally been temporary. For\neach quarter from 1998 to 2010, the figure plots the difference between total inflation and core\ninflation at the time, and the total inflation rate two years later. What it shows is that when there\nis a supply shock such that total inflation (including food and energy) exceeds core inflation, two\nyears later total inflation tends to be lower – when supply shocks such as oil prices drive up total\ninflation relative to core, the total tends to come back down toward the core inflation rate.\nFigure 9 performs similar analysis but focuses on the future core inflation rate, instead of\nthe total. It shows no strong relationship. When total and core inflation diverge, core inflation\ntends to stay put. In other words, in recent years, when something like an oil shock causes total\ninflation to diverge from core, there was no consistent implication for the future core inflation\nrate. The shock to total inflation did not become embedded in core inflation.\nWhy is all this important? If supply shocks tend to have a transitory impact on headline\ninflation, and do not pass through to any meaningful extent into core inflation, then monetary\npolicy need not respond to the price increases caused by the supply shock. Currently, we have\nexperienced sharply higher food and energy prices. If the relationship we document over the last\n13 years continues, we should expect the impact on inflation to be transitory – and that total\ninflation will converge back to core inflation, which remains well below 2 percent.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nTo digress, it is likely the case that supply shocks have become transitory because of the\nway in which monetary policy has tended to respond. So, as long as monetary policy behaves\nabout as it has in recent years, then there is no reason to expect supply shocks to have lasting\neffects.\nSo is Fed policy behaving as it has since the mid 1980s? Interestingly, although Fed\npolicy is perceived as exceptionally accommodative, because of hitting the zero lower bound the\nfederal funds rate is actually higher – has come down less – than would be expected if the Fed\nbehaved as it has over the last 25 years. The current level of the funds rate suggest that we have\nbeen less accommodative in recent years given that interest-rate reductions (policy easing) ran\ninto at the zero lower bound.4\n\nWhy the Different Reaction to Supply Shocks Over Time?\nBut how confident should we be that the relationship we have experienced over the past\n25 years – little response in medium term inflation rates to supply shocks – will continue? The\nanswer is rooted in why we are seeing different reactions to supply shocks – in other words a\ndifferent interplay of total and core inflation – now versus in the past.\nThere are a variety of reasons why medium-term inflation has not been significantly\ninfluenced by short-run supply shocks in recent years. In my view the reasons include the\nincreased role of services in the economy, the importance of labor costs in such an economy, the\nreduced share of oil consumption relative to GDP, and as I mentioned earlier the improved\nconduct of monetary policy versus the 1960s and 1970s.5\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 10 shows that the service sector has grown from a little over 60 percent of private\nsector employment in 1970 to a little over 80 percent in 2010. As the economy has come to\nemphasize services versus manufacturing, it may be that commodities (and thus their prices)\nhave become somewhat less important to the production of goods and services. And goods\nprices are more volatile than services prices, and more likely to be priced like commodities.\nFigure 11 shows the per capita consumption of oil declining in the United States.\nConservation measures by consumers and businesses have made the economy less dependent on\noil than in the 1970s. While oil remains a very important commodity, the trend towards reducing\ndependence on oil provides greater insulation from oil-induced supply shocks.\nFigure 12 shows the U.S. share of world oil consumption (in blue) ticking down, but also\nclearly shows (in red) the steady climb in the share consumed by three of the so-called emergingmarket economies – China, India, and Brazil. Figure 13 shows the growth in oil consumption in\nthose three countries, in the upper three lines. Both charts depict quite strikingly the heightened\ndemand for oil emanating from emerging markets.\nReturning to the U.S. and inflation concerns, Figure 14 shows that the growth rate of\nemployee compensation has generally been declining over the past two decades. With\ncompensation slowing and productivity increasing, many firms have been profitable and able to\nwithstand increases in commodity prices without passing such costs on to final prices. This fits\nwith the observation that higher food and energy prices have not tended to have much of an\nimpact on prices in situations where food and energy are not direct costs of doing business.\nFigure 15 shows two measures of inflation expectations, plotted alongside oil price\nmovements. The red line shows what professional forecasters expected inflation to average over\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthe next 10 years, at various points in time. Their expectations have declined somewhat over the\npast 20 years, but what is striking is the relative stability of their inflation expectations. In\naddition, there was no significant reaction to the oil price shock that we experienced in 2008.\nThe chart also shows a second measure of inflation expectations – the University of Michigan\nSurvey (the green line), which asks respondents about their expectations for inflation over the\nnext 5 to 10 years6. Again these expectations are not very responsive to movements in oil prices,\nand have remained quite stable over the past two decades.\nIt is worth noting that countries can be affected quite differently by supply shocks. As\nFigure 16 shows, the importance of food in the “basket” of goods purchased by consumers can\nvary greatly by country. In less developed countries, food is a very significant component of\noverall purchases by consumers. In a developed country such as the United States, food is a\nmuch smaller share of overall purchases. Thus the impact of a food-supply shock on the overall\ninflation rate and on other important economic variables such as wages and total imports can\nvary widely by country. Given the different impacts of supply shocks, it is not surprising that\nmonetary policy is likely to react differently to a supply shock such as food, depending on the\nunique characteristics of the particular country.\nFigure 17 shows that in the United States, the importance of food as a component of\ninflation measures has been declining over time. And, despite improvements in energy\nconservation that have lowered the per capita consumption of oil, higher energy prices have\ncontributed to recent increases in the importance of energy in the consumer price index. The fact\nthat food and energy prices have been quite volatile recently, but remain a relatively small part of\nthe entire basket of goods, helps to explain why core inflation rates have not been particularly\nresponsive to food and energy shocks.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I recognize that recent supply shocks have caused pressures on many\nhousehold budgets, and have led some analysts and observers to become concerned about\npotential long-term inflationary impacts. However, I think the evidence shows that over the past\n25 years most supply shocks have been transitory – and have had no long-lasting imprint on\nlonger term inflation, or on inflation expectations.\nNonetheless, recent historical trends do not always continue, so it is important to monitor\ninflation dynamics very closely to make sure that this pattern is continuing in the incoming data.\nIn particular, I will look intently at whether there is any evidence that the expectations of\nunderlying inflation have changed. To date, expectations seem quite stable and show no\nevidence of diverging from the recent past. I am committed to responding decisively, and as\nforcefully as necessary, to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain stable and that\nfood and energy price increases are not passing through to other prices.7\nGiven the important role of labor costs in a developed, services-focused economy such as\nthe United States, it is important to closely monitor trends in labor markets. Currently, wages\nand salaries are reflecting heightened unemployment, and show no evidence that potential\ninflation concerns are placing upward pressure on wages and salaries.\nCore inflation rates tend to be a reasonable predictor of inflation in the intermediate term.\nCore inflation remains well below my long-run target for inflation. This gives us flexibility to\nfocus on accommodative monetary policy doing what it can to promote more rapid growth in the\neconomy. As Figure 18 illustrates, the percent of the adult population that is employed now is\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nquite low in relation to recent history, and has shown only a slight improvement over the course\nof the recovery.\nSo with significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation expectations, and core inflation\nwell below our longer run target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down with\ntighter monetary policy. Until we make more progress on both elements of the Federal\nReserve’s mandate – employment and inflation – the current, accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy is appropriate.\nThank you.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nMy colleague Geoffrey Tootell, Director of Research at the Boston Fed, has prepared an illuminating public policy\nbrief that investigates whether commodity price spikes cause long-term inflation. The brief, which will be available\nat http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppb/2011/ppb111.htm, examines the relationship between trend inflation and\ncommodity price increases and finds that evidence from recent decades supports the notion that commodity price\nchanges do not affect the long-run inflation rate. Evidence from earlier decades suggests that effects on inflation\nexpectations and wages played a key role in whether commodity price movements altered trend inflation.\n2\n\nReaders may be interested in “Oil and the Macroeconomy in a Changing World,” the proceedings of a 2010\nsymposium held at the Boston Fed to explore the interactions between energy prices, growth, and inflation – the\ndeterminants of oil prices and about the effect that oil prices have on the world economy. The proceedings are\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/oil2010/index.htm\n\n3\n\nEven future purchases can be affected, if saving for them is squeezed.\n\n4\n\nThe Fed’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases have partly, but not completely, substituted for the constraint imposed by\nthe zero lower bound on policy easing. With all the excess capacity — a reflection of our inability to be as\naccommodative as we might have liked, given the zero bound — it seems unlikely that supply shocks will turn into\nincreased inflation expectations that will affect wages and non-oil, non-food prices.\n5\n\nVice Chair Yellen notes that “a key lesson from the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the stability of\nlonger-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. At that time, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy\nframework was opaque, its measures of resource utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a\nstop-start pattern that undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve's commitment to keep inflation under\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at 8:05 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncontrol. Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and nominal wages and prices spiraled\nupward as workers sought compensation for past price increases and as firms responded to accelerating labor costs\nwith further increases in prices. That wage-price spiral was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under\nChairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s. Since then the Federal Reserve\nhas remained determined to avoid these mistakes and to keep inflation low and stable.”\n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20110411a.htm]\n6\n\nThe average annual expected price change they expect over the next 5 to 10 years\n\n7\n\nSee for example the comments on commodity price pressures and monetary policy by my colleague William\nDudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and Vice Chair of the Federal Open Market Committee:\n“Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term\ninflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.”\n[http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2011/dud110228.html]\n\n14\n\n\fHow Should Monetary Policy\nRespond to Price Increases\nDriven by Supply Shocks?\nEric S.

        "content": "* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nRemarks at a Forum on Opportunities and\nChallenges Facing New England’s\nSmaller Industrial Cities\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nClark University\nWorcester, Massachusetts\nJuly 13, 2011\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today in Worcester as we discuss the opportunities and\nchallenges facing New England’s smaller industrial cities.1 At the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,\nwe are very pleased to be collaborating with our co-sponsors in organizing this forum –\nthe Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise, MassINC, and the Rappaport Institute for Greater\nBoston.\nI would like to briefly frame the economic context that prevails as we gather today. I think the\neconomic backdrop only underscores the importance of a practical and constructive forum like this\none, and the need for collaboration and leadership – which are themes of particular focus at this event.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nThe deep recession and slow recovery have had a significant impact on New England’s cities.\nAt the same time, we should note that our experience of late in New England has been less severe\nthan that of the nation. The unemployment rate for New England in May, the latest month we have a\nregional number for, was 7.9 percent – high, but well below the 9.1 percent rate for the nation as a\nwhole in May (a number that climbed to 9.2 percent in June). Many of our cities, particularly in the\nnorthern half of New England, have unemployment rates well below the national average. Also,\nmany cities in New England did not experience the extremes of boom and bust in residential real\nestate that plagued some cities elsewhere in the country.\nAs the economy continues its slow recovery, there are significant opportunities but also\ndaunting challenges facing our cities. But before discussing those opportunities and challenges, I\nwould like to briefly describe the national economic outlook.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\n\nAs we consider the national outlook, I would note that some have referred to the first half of\nthis year as a “slow patch” in the recovery. I am not sure that phrase is quite right, however – the\nnotion of a slow patch suggests strong growth that has been temporarily interrupted by some sort of\nheadwind or shock, like natural disasters or extreme weather that crimps economic activity. I would\ninstead describe the past two years as a consistently weak recovery, interrupted by a period of\nstronger growth. Let me add that a weak recovery like we have seen is, unfortunately, typical of\nrecoveries after a financial crisis.2\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 1 shows growth in what we call real final sales, which represents the goods and\nservices produced in the economy, not including inventories. If one assumes that the economy needs\nto grow faster than 2.5 percent – an estimate of what economists call its potential – to yield much\nimprovement in the unemployment rate, you see that we have had only one strong quarter in this\nrecovery (the fourth quarter of 2010).\nAlso, Figure 2 shows that consumers have been particularly tentative during the recovery.\nThe only quarter in which we saw consumption growth in excess of 2.5 percent during this recovery\nwas that same fourth quarter of 2010.\nIn short, the only quarter of strong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one\ncontaining the holiday season at the end of last year. With housing activity and government spending\nlikely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business\nconfidence improve so that consumption and investment can offset the weaker growth in other\ncomponents of gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe first half of this year saw the economic recovery impacted by the tragic destruction in\nJapan, which disrupted manufacturing supply chains, as well as weather issues ranging from severe\nwinter conditions to damaging floods. The result is that growth in the first half of this year is likely to\nbe roughly 2 percent.\nAs the effects of these problems fade, we do expect a rebound in purchases of consumer\ndurables to yield stronger growth in the third quarter. I expect economic growth over the second half\nof this year to average somewhere in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 percent. While this represents an\nimprovement from the first half, it is still quite slow given the amount of slack in the economy, and\nslower than I had expected at the beginning of this year.\nWhile we are seeing some positive economic signs such as equipment and software spending,\nand growth in exports, the employment report issued last Friday was dismal. The national\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nunemployment rate rose slightly (a tenth of a percent) to 9.2 percent in June. And net job growth was\nvery weak over the last two months – job growth averaged only 21,500 over the two-month period of\nMay and June.3 The employment-to-population ratio fell to 58.2 percent, matching the 28 year low\nthat we have hit a few times in this recovery.4\nNot surprisingly, with so much painful slack in the labor market we are not seeing any\nsignificant wage pressure – average hourly earnings fell slightly this month and have increased only\n1.9 percent over the past year – which is consistent with a continued low inflation rate in the medium\nterm. As Figures 3 highlights, wages are not likely to place much upward pressure on inflation since\ncompensation is growing only slowly, given weak job markets. In addition, Figure 4 shows that\nmany commodity prices have stabilized or retreated from their recent highs. These factors give\nmonetary policy the leeway to remain accommodative, so as to provide the monetary conditions for\nimproved economic growth.\nIn addition, there are significant downside risks associated with an outlook that includes only\nvery slow improvement in the economy. The headlines from Europe continue to remind us of this.\nWith fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here and abroad, it will in my view be important\nto maintain sufficiently accommodative U.S. monetary policy so that national labor market conditions\ncan improve.\n\nOpportunities and Challenges for New England’s Mid-Sized Cities\n\nSo the national outlook is for a continued slow recovery, which of course factors into the\nopportunities and challenges for New England’s mid-sized cities we have come together to discuss\ntoday.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nAlso, with widespread pressure for fiscal austerity not only impacting Federal budgets but also\nbudgets at the state and local level, I think we should acknowledge the acute challenges that cities\nface in prioritizing expenditures to ensure that program cuts do not impair the ability of their\ncommunities to prosper over the long term.\nAs we think about their opportunities and challenges, I think it is useful to highlight some of\nthe trends in New England’s mid-sized cities relative to New England as a whole, and the nation. For\nexample, Figure 5 highlights the differences in the populations of our mid-sized cities and the rest of\nthe region and the country with respect to age, at roughly decade intervals. The most recent data\nsuggest that New England as a whole now has a greater portion of people over 65 and a smaller\nportion of people under 15, and age 15 to 24, than the U.S. However, the residents of the region’s\nsmall and mid-sized cities are on average younger than the rest of New England – with a smaller share\nof people over 65 and a larger share of people 15 to 24 than both the region and the nation. As for the\nportion of people under 15, these cities exceed the region and are basically on par with the nation.\nIn exploring these trends and characteristics, I would like to offer a few possibilities – in the\ninterest of generating discussion today.\nFirst, it may be that younger workers “just starting out” are especially receptive to training for\njobs in a growing sector. So this younger profile of our mid-sized cities, and the fact that they are\noften the site of medical facilities serving the surrounding communities, together highlight a potential\nopportunity. Many of the mid-sized cities may be able to build on their medical-services base. While\nmedical employers require highly skilled doctors and nurses, they also hire a variety of other\nemployees in positions that often require only an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Indeed, our\nanalysis suggests that the number of jobs in the healthcare industry as a percent of total jobs is much\nhigher for these mid-sized New England cities than it is for the region as a whole, or for the nation.5\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nWorcester is a particularly good example of this, being home to hospitals, the University of\nMassachusetts medical school, and medical research firms. Other cities in the region have major\nmedical facilities with spillover benefits to the broader community, including Providence (with\nBrown medical school and partner hospitals), New Haven (with Yale school of medicine and YaleNew Haven Hospital), greater Hartford (with the University of Connecticut Health Center in the\nHartford suburb of Farmington), and Springfield (with Baystate Medical Center).\nTurning to educational characteristics in these cities, Figure 6 shows the percent of the\npopulation with a bachelor’s degree or higher, and with some college education or an associate’s\ndegree – again at roughly decade intervals. New England has a much higher percentage of college\ngraduates than the nation as a whole, but a smaller percentage of people with some college education\nor an associate’s degree. In contrast, the mid-sized cities have a smaller percentage than New\nEngland or the U.S of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher, or some college education or an\nassociate’s degree. The trend is up in these cities, however, over time.\nThis is particularly significant when we note that the unemployment experience over the past\ndecade has been quite different when segmented by educational attainment, as shown in Figure 7.\nThis is particularly true over the past several years, when the unemployment rates by educational\nattainment have widened significantly from where they were 10 years ago.\nAll this may suggest that community colleges can and should play a larger role in many of our\nmid-sized cities. Community colleges in New England have played less of a role in workforce\ndevelopment than in some parts of the country, where there is a very close connection between\nemployers (and potential employers) and the curricula developed and offered at community colleges.\nAs we think about future developments in our mid-sized cities, it is important that leaders at\ncommunity colleges and local business leaders work together in the ongoing development of\nspecialized curricula that will meet the evolving needs of local employers.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 8 shows that mid-sized cities in New England are increasingly diverse. Mid-sized\nNew England cities have a much higher proportion of individuals who were born outside of the U.S.\nthan the rest of New England or the country, and this has intensified over recent decades. These cities\nalso have a much higher percentage of individuals who are not proficient English speakers. This\nhighlights a potential impediment to getting higher education or some jobs.\nThe availability of English classes remains extremely important, and increasingly so. The\nsame is true for providing greater access to government programs for those with limited English. For\nexample, a working paper by the Bank’s Ana Patricia Muñoz shows that small business\nentrepreneurship programs often do not target Latino populations.6 State and Federal programs\ndesigned to help fund or provide technical assistance to small businesses may need to increasingly\ntailor some of their programs to fit the needs of local populations.\nHowever, despite these challenges I believe that the diversity in our mid-sized cities can also\nbe a decided advantage. Let me show another chart, Figure 9, which instead of foreign born and\nlimited English speakers simply indicates the portion of the population that is Hispanic, and the\nportion that is African American. You see again that while New England as a whole may be less\ndiverse than the rest of the nation, our mid-sized cities are more diverse -- and increasingly so over\nthe decades. Finding ways for businesses to reach diverse populations is likely to become\nincreasingly important as the country as a whole becomes more diverse, and as technology allows\neven small companies to reach markets in other countries. A product or service developed by or for a\ndiverse population in Worcester or Hartford or another mid-sized city may be a first step toward\naccessing diverse markets in the U.S., or even globally.\nMoreover, developing successful entrepreneurs within a diverse population could of course be\na source of local economic development. The Muñoz paper finds Latino businesses starting up in\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nmany of New England’s mid-sized cities, and this can be a source of future job growth if some of\nthese businesses can grow.\nFinally and importantly, I would observe that while New England has fared better than the rest\nof the country during the recession and the early stages of the recovery, the same is not true for our\nmid-sized cities, as shown in Figure 10. Unemployment rates are much higher in the mid-sized cities\nthan they are in New England or the country as a whole, in contrast to 10 years ago when the\nunemployment rates in the region’s mid-sized cities were below the national average.\n\nConcluding Observations\n\nIn summary and conclusion, our mid-sized cities are on average younger, proportionally less\nadvanced in education, and more diverse than the rest of New England. This provides both\nopportunities and challenges, as I have noted.\nAs many of these cities are regional centers, further developing their activities as medical and\neducational centers will be important, particularly given their younger population compared to New\nEngland as a whole.\nA theme for this conference is the need to build collaborative leadership. Leaders in\ngovernment will need to work collaboratively with leaders in education, the sciences, and businesses\nmore generally, and find ways to take advantage of some of the differences we see in our mid-sized\ncities.\nI think we all know this, and the challenge is in finding the best ways to do so, to everyone’s\nbenefit. It is our hope that this forum will be one avenue for supporting and advancing that\ncollaboration.\nThank you.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM Eastern time on Wednesday, July 13, 2011, or upon delivery *\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nWe define mid-sized cities in New England as those with a population ranging from 75,000 to 250,000, excluding\n“suburb cities” within 20 miles of Boston – specifically, Bridgeport, CT; Danbury, CT; Hartford, CT; New Haven, CT;\nNorwalk, CT; Stamford, CT; Waterbury, CT; Brockton, MA; Fall River, MA; Lawrence, MA; Lowell, MA; Lynn, MA;\nNew Bedford, MA; Springfield, MA; Worcester, MA; Manchester, NH; Nashua, NH; Cranston, RI; Providence, RI; and\nWarwick, RI.\n2\n\nAs I have discussed in other forums, the following dynamic forms one explanation for why recessions that are\naccompanied by problems at financial intermediaries tend to be deeper recessions, followed by slower recoveries. Banks\nexperiencing large losses are often reluctant to raise additional capital – either because it could signal financial problems\nor be perceived as an attempt to avoid diluting existing shareholders. Instead, firms that choose not to raise additional\ncapital often satisfy capital-to-assets requirements by shrinking their assets, and more importantly for the real economy,\nreducing their willingness to lend (loans are assets on a bank’s balance sheet). If this behavior is widespread, it can\nsignificantly reduce credit intermediation. Earlier in my career I studied this dynamic with my colleague Joe Peek, and\nour research found such behavior during the credit crunch period in the United States during the 1990 recession and during\nthe Japanese banking crisis.\nSee the following from Peek and Rosengren: “The Capital Crunch: Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be,\" Journal of\nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 27, no. 3 (August 1995): 625-638. “Bank Regulation and the Credit Crunch,” in the\nJournal of Banking & Finance, Volume 19, Issues 3-4, June 1995, pages 679-692. \"The International Transmission of\nFinancial Shocks: The Case of Japan\" in the American Economic Review vol. 87, no. 4 (September 1997), pages 495-505.\n\"Collateral Damage: Effects of the Japanese Bank Crisis on Real Activity in the United States\" in the American Economic\nReview, vol. 90, no. 1 (March 2000), pages 30-45. \"Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of\nCredit in Japan\" in the American Economic Review, vol. 95(4), September 2005, pages 1144-1166.\n3\n\nAbout 18,000 jobs were added in June and the May figure was revised to 25,000. The percent change over the two\nmonths is 0.03%. Employment rose by an average of 215,000 jobs per month from February through April but now has\naveraged 21,500 jobs over the past two months.\n4\n\nThe employment-to-population ratio hit 58.2 percent in Dec. 2009, Nov. 2010, and June 2011. It was 58.1 percent in\nJuly of 1983.\n5\n\nUsing data from the Economic Census, the figure for health care employment in mid-sized cities is almost 30 percent\n– twice as large a proportion as for the U.S. or New England – but it should be noted that the figures are calculated as a\npercent of total jobs that are available in the Economic Census, which excludes several job-heavy sectors (like elementary\nand secondary schools, colleges and universities, public administration and employees in most government owned\nestablishments like public utilities). Using different data sources that include many of these sectors suggests health care is\nover 22 percent of jobs in mid-sized Massachusetts cities, just under 15 percent in New England, and around 12 percent in\nthe U.S. Either approach suggests that health care is a very important sector for jobs, in absolute terms and compared to\nthe U.S. and rest of New England.\n6\n\nAna Patricia Muñoz, \"Small Businesses in Springfield, Massachusetts: A Look at Latino Entrepreneurship\", a Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston Community Development Discussion paper with Lynn Browne, Sol Carbonell, Prabal\nChakrabarti, DeAnna Green, Yolanda K.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Economic Outlook Seminar\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nSeptember 28, 2011\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be in Sweden to participate in today’s session on the current economic\noutlook and tomorrow’s conference on capital markets in the post-crisis environment. It is vital that\npolicymakers and practitioners study and apply the recent lessons of the global economy and financial\ninterdependence, so I am glad to be able to join you in these discussions.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nOn a personal note, I should mention that my grandfather John Johanson left Sweden at the\nage of six, changing his name to Rosengren and joining his father – who was deploying what he had\nlearned as a gardener in Sweden to open greenhouses in America. My relatives were able to take\nwhat they had learned in Sweden and apply it – with perhaps some variation – in the United States. In\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\na similar way, there is much to consider about the economic experience in Europe and the U.S. over\nthe past four years. What is similar? What is different? And what can be learned and applied?\nThe window into these broader questions that I would like to use today is housing. One of the\nhallmarks of the recent financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruption, has been the very\nsignificant role played by unusually large movements in residential real estate values, within and\nacross countries.\nGiven our setting today, let me start by comparing U.S. and Swedish home price movements\nsince 1995, shown in Figure 1. In the U.S., house prices increased steadily and reached a peak in\n2006, before beginning an unprecedented decline – not just in selected regions of the country, but\nnationally – resulting in aggregate declines of more than 30 percent. In contrast, Swedish real estate\nprices increased even more substantially, and have not experienced any substantial decline. Indeed,\nthey continued to rise after the global financial crisis.\nWhile the U.S. housing price decline was a nationwide phenomenon, there were relatively\nmore severe declines in some parts of the country, such as the so-called “sand states” of Florida,\nArizona, Nevada, and California. Figure 2 shows the home price declines in various metropolitan\nareas (a subset of those included in the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index) and the lines drop\nfurthest and fastest for the metro areas in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California.\nAs I talk with economists from countries whose housing values have risen markedly but not\nexperienced sharp declines, I have been struck by two things. First, they are often confident that\nnational (versus regional) house-price reductions are unlikely. And secondly, most assume that a\ndecline in house prices would have a measured impact on the economy should that in fact occur. But\nthe experience of Japan in recent decades and the U.S. more recently1 should provide some caution –\ngiven that the economic retrenchment that followed these significant declines in home values\nexceeded most people’s expectations.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nWhile sustained rapid increases in house prices are frequently followed by significant\ndeclines, I am certainly not predicting price declines in any country, given my limited knowledge of\nmarket characteristics. But I do recommend a thoughtful consideration of the recent U.S. experience,\ngiven its severity and the fact that it was not foreseen. Indeed, while residential investment2 now\ncomprises only 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the U.S., our housing problems have\nhad a tremendously disproportionate impact on economic performance and on the recovery of growth\nand employment.\nI would like to discuss some of the reasons for that disproportionate impact today. By way of\npreview, let me mention that I plan to highlight the following points.\nFirst, while housing is a small component of U.S. GDP, it is also quite volatile. Historically,\nan outsized proportion of U.S. economic growth in the first two years of a recovery from a recession\nis generated by residential investment. The sector is very responsive to monetary policy3 since the\nability to purchase a home can be quite sensitive to the interest rate and the resulting cost of financing.\nSecond, the characteristics of a country’s mortgage-finance market determine the impact that\nwill come from a change in the rates directly influenced by monetary policy. In the U.S., most homes\nare financed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, so a fall in long-term interest rates really only affects\nexisting home owners to the extent they refinance. As a result, the U.S. gets less effect from the\nmovement of short-term, monetary policy interest rates compared to countries where the primary\nmortgage financing instruments are floating-rate loans. In countries with this institutional feature,\nboth new and existing home buyers get more immediate boosts from lower short-term rates. Figure 3\nhelps to illustrate this by showing the greater responsiveness of U.S. adjustable-rate mortgage rates to\nthe target federal funds rate, versus 30-year fixed-rate loans.\nThird, many U.S. financial institutions have significant exposure to real estate, either through\ndirect lending or through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, declines in real\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nestate prices can have a substantial impact on the capital of financial institutions, which impacts their\nability to finance not only the housing sector, but also other sectors of the economy.4\nFourth, falling home prices have not only impaired the capital of many financial institutions,\nbut in a very real sense have disrupted the transmission of monetary policy. This is because falling\nhome prices have brought about a situation where the availability of credit is more important in many\ncases than the cost of credit. Borrowers may not qualify for lower rates – in other words, the credit\nmight not be available to them – because their household balance sheet is weaker than prior to the\nrecession, because the collateral values of homes and commercial real estate have fallen, and because\nlender perception of risks inherent in the economy and in collateral valuations has risen – all at a time\nwhen lenders’ capital has been depleted.\nFifth, I will argue that changes in some housing policies in the U.S. could make it less difficult\nfor monetary policy to affect the economy when housing prices have fallen.\nI will also discuss the actions taken last week at the FOMC to promote a faster recovery in the\nhousing sector and the economy more broadly. I am very supportive of these actions.\nLet me stress that I know housing markets have critical institutional features that differ greatly\nacross countries – including financing arrangements, mortgage insurance, the role of government, tax\ntreatment, mortgage servicing, and borrower liability in foreclosure. This makes it difficult to\ngeneralize from the U.S. experience.\nWhat may be transferable, however, is the observation that sharp declines in housing prices\ncan have additional negative effects, with broad implications for macroeconomic outcomes and\nmonetary policy – broader, perhaps, than may be assumed and incorporated into most statistical\nmodels of the economy. I don’t intend to talk about whether housing prices will fall, but rather want\nto emphasize that when they do fall the effect on the economy is often much greater than many people\nexpect.\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nLet me pause to mention at the outset that a number of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve\nare studying and speaking about these important issues. Most recently Elizabeth Duke, a member of\nthe Fed’s Board of Governors and herself a former banker, spoke at the Board’s Policy Forum on the\nHousing Market Going Forward and I recommend her address to you.5 I share Governor Duke’s\nview that in the U.S. we “currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance that it is\nhampering our economic recovery.” I may not be as convinced as she is about one possible remedy –\nthat banks may be suitable landlords upon converting foreclosed properties to rentals – but I\nrecommend absorbing her perspectives on things that can be done in the near term to help the housing\nmarket stabilize and rebalance.6\nAlso, colleagues at the Boston Fed including Paul Willen and Chris Foote have done a great\ndeal of empirical work on these issues, and are exploring the key institutional characteristics of the\nhousing market that play important roles in the current problems. Among other things, they are\nworking on estimates of the macroeconomic effects of possible refinancing plans.\n\nThe Role of Housing in the Slow U.S. Recovery\nThe decline in housing prices has created a multitude of difficulties for the U.S. economic\nrecovery. I would like to provide some evidence of the problem, and discuss its origins.\nThe housing sector in the U.S. played a major role in the recent financial crisis, and in making\nthe recovery from the resulting recession so anemic. In the U.S. we had seen regional declines in\nhome prices during previous recessions, but had not seen a national decline in house prices in the\npost-war era. So for most lenders, investors, and homeowners, the sustained and substantial decline\nin home prices was not anticipated. Even sophisticated investors had placed only a very small\nprobability on such a correlated decline. A key lesson from the past several years is that homes are\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nnot riskless investments – and that highly rated, regionally-diversified mortgage securities do not\nnecessarily carry low risk.\nAs mentioned earlier, even though residential investment is a small share of GDP (today only\n2.2 percent), it is quite interest-sensitive – it can decline quite dramatically as interest rates rise, and\nexpand quickly when interest rates are relatively low. So it has been a disproportionally important\npart of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.\nIn the current situation, however, U.S. mortgage rates are quite low but residential investment\nhas not been the engine of growth that it normally is in economic recoveries. As shown in Figure 4,\nexports have been a source of strength in the first two years of the U.S. recovery, and business fixed\ninvestment has grown at approximately the same rate in this recovery as in the previous three. Yet the\nhousehold sector has been particularly weak. Consumption, which accounts for approximately 70\npercent of U.S. GDP, has grown only about half as much in the first two years of the recovery as it did\nin the previous three recoveries. And the shortfall for residential investment is even more striking. In\nthe previous three recoveries, residential investment grew over 30 percent on average in the first years\nof the recovery – but has actually decreased in the first two years of this recovery.\nFigure 5 explores this pattern further by showing the contributions to total GDP growth that\nresidential investment has provided in the first and second years of recent recoveries. In the past three\nrecoveries, residential investment on average contributed more than 20 percent of GDP growth in the\nfirst year and 10 percent of growth in the second. So in the typical recovery, residential investment\ncontributes much more to growth in the first two years of the recovery than would be expected given\nits share of GDP. This reflects the fact that interest rates generally fall during a recession and the\ninitial stages of a recovery – and residential investment is usually quite responsive to interest rates.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nIn this recovery, residential investment was only a small share of the growth in the first year of\nthe recovery and declined in the second year. So the unusually slow recovery is, in part, due to the\nuncharacteristically muted response of residential investment to very low interest rates.\nMore than one observer has commented that we are seeing a different pattern this time that\nequates almost to a “negative feedback loop.” High unemployment leads to risk aversion, which\ndecreases demand for new housing. But without construction activity we are not seeing the typical\nuptick in housing-related jobs.\nHaving said a bit about residential investment and the slow recovery, I would like to now\ntouch on other problems that stem from the decline in housing prices. Because residential investment\nis not the only facet of the economy that is affected by the drop in home values.\nIndeed, the decline in housing prices has contributed to a sharp decline in household wealth.\nIn fact, Figure 6 shows (in both dollar and percent terms) that there was a significant decline in\nhousehold net worth from 2005 to 2009, and that it particularly impacted racial and ethnic minorities\nin the U.S.7 These insights are drawn from a Pew Research Center study that used data from the\nCensus Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.8\nTo explore this a bit more, Figure 7 shows that while homes are an important component of\nnet worth for Americans regardless of racial and ethnic group, African American and Hispanic\nhouseholds are particularly reliant on home values as a share of their wealth (between 50 and 60\npercent, versus between 30 and 40 percent for White and Asian households in the U.S.). While stock\nprices have increased substantially from their crisis lows, those households whose primary source of\nwealth is their home have been disproportionately affected by the decline in house prices. And\nintuitively, households whose net worth has been significantly impacted are likely to reduce their\nconsumption levels by more than households whose net worth has recovered.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 8 shows the erosion in home equity for U.S. households, again in both dollar and\npercent terms. Home equity is not only a source of funds to finance consumer purchases, but also\nfrequently serves as a source of funds for individuals starting new businesses. With the decline in\nhome equity, many entrepreneurs do not have that route available to finance start-ups or to expand\nexisting small businesses.\nThe weak housing sector also has an impact on employment. Figure 9 shows that far fewer\njobs have been created in the first two years of this recovery (the left bar in each pair) than in previous\nrecoveries (the right bar in the pair). In fact, construction jobs have continued to decline during the\nfirst two years of this recovery – we have lost over a half a million construction jobs since the\nrecovery began. While construction employment is typically volatile during a recovery, on average\nthe sector adds roughly 150,000 jobs.\nIndeed, Figure 10 shows that employment in construction has declined by 9 percent in the\nfirst two years of this recovery compared to growth over 4 percent during the previous three\nrecoveries. And weak construction employment and activity also reduces the demand for labor in\nsectors that support construction.\nFigure 11 highlights that the rate of mortgage delinquency in the U.S. has been much greater\nduring this recession than in previous ones. Despite two years of recovery (albeit a very slow one),\nthe mortgage delinquency rate remains well above the peak level seen over the previous 30 years.\nAnd Figure 12 shows that with significant foreclosures and a weak economy, both the housing\nvacancy rate and the rental vacancy rate remain quite high by historical standards.\nSo the problems in housing have greatly complicated the recovery in the U.S. Not only has\nresidential investment been unusually weak, but “to add insult to injury” consumption, business\nformation, and employment have also been affected by problems in the housing sector.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nHousing’s Impacts on the Policy Response\nMonetary policy in the U.S., entrusted to the Federal Reserve by Congress, has responded\naggressively to both the severe recession and the weak recovery. Short-term interest rates were cut\nessentially to zero.\nHitting the so-called “zero lower bound” has certainly brought challenges to the ability of\nmonetary policy to stimulate the economy. However, once the zero lower bound was reached, the\nFederal Reserve used a variety of tools to try to push down longer-term interest rates, as merited by\neconomic conditions. Our efforts have included asset purchases both traditional (Treasury securities)\nand nontraditional (mortgage-backed securities). We have also altered our communications strategy.\nAt the August FOMC meeting we announced that the Fed expects to maintain short-term interest\nrates (the target range for the federal funds rate) near the zero bound at least through mid-2013 unless\nthere is a significant improvement in economic conditions relative to our forecast, and as long as the\ninflation outlook remains subdued.9 At the September FOMC meeting we announced a plan to extend\nthe maturity of our holdings of securities and reinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency\ndebt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The recent\nactions have helped lower long-term interest rates significantly, which is intended to promote growth\nin interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.\nFigure 13 shows that in the U.S. the 10-year Treasury rate, and 30-year mortgage rates, have\nreached historically low levels. Figure 14 illustrates that the combination of low rates and falling\nhouse prices significantly improved the affordability of homes.10 In addition, Figure 15 shows that\nboth population and household formation in the U.S. have continued to rise over the past five years.11\nThe problem is, while many households have been able to refinance and some new home\nbuyers have taken advantage of the improved affordability of houses, falling home prices have made\nmany unable to refinance, and many unable or unwilling to purchase a home. While the housing\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nmarket would have been more severely impacted (and housing prices fallen more substantially) had\nthe Federal Reserve not eased monetary policy aggressively, the impact of our policies on the\neconomy has clearly been impaired by falling housing prices.\nMonetary policy would have had a greater impact if households were able to respond to the\nlower interest rates as if house prices had not fallen. The data can help one gauge the scope of the\npotential. The widely followed CoreLogic estimate is that as of the second quarter, 10.9 million, or\n22.5 percent, of all mortgaged residential properties had negative equity, where the debt exceeds the\nvalue of the house.12 These so-called upside-down homeowners typically have a much harder time\nrefinancing than owners with positive equity.\nAlong these lines, CoreLogic estimates that about three-quarters of owners with negative\nequity are paying \"above-market\" interest rates, which the company defines as rates above 5.1\npercent.13 By contrast, slightly more than half of positive-equity owners are paying above-market\nrates. All in all, CoreLogic estimates that there are about 28 million borrowers who are paying abovemarket rates and thus might potentially benefit from a refinance.14\nThere are several proposals that attempt to facilitate refinancing for homeowners who have\nbeen negatively impacted by the drop in housing prices. These proposals do face hurdles, including\nhow to address private mortgage insurance and second liens. However, a program that made it\npossible for many homeowners to refinance, even if they were upside down, would likely provide\nsignificant reductions in mortgage payments to individuals who are likely to have a relatively high\npropensity to consume. Clearly getting more money into the hands of homeowners who would spend\nit could help to fuel GDP growth. This would reduce one of the impediments to a more significant\neffect from the monetary policy actions taken to date.\nI hasten to add that there is already a government program to allow underwater borrowers to\nrefinance, the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). This program allows underwater\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nborrowers with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans to refinance at lower rates. Unfortunately, the\nprogram has helped fewer borrowers than was originally hoped. Fed Governor Betsy Duke outlined\nsome of the potential reasons why, in the talk I mentioned earlier. They include loan-level price\nadjustments (LLPAs) that raise interest rates for many borrowers and thereby reduce the benefit of\nrefinancing; originator worries about “buybacks” forced on them by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;\njunior lien-holder resistance to re-subordinating their loans; and mortgage insurance policies.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is now investigating whether there are ways\nto enhance the program to benefit more borrowers.15 As this work proceeds, I hope the FHFA\nconsiders dropping or reducing LLPAs in cases when a GSE loan is refinanced into another GSE\nloan. Such a refinance actually reduces the GSE’s credit risk (they already guarantee the existing\nmortgage and the homeowner will be able to take advantage of lower rates, freeing up cash flow).\nA second potential way to help resuscitate the housing sector would be to facilitate the\nreduction in the number of vacant homes.16 One way to do this would be to help responsible investors\npurchase vacant homes and then convert them into rental properties. Today, a majority of investor\ndeals are financed with cash, which suggests that there is room for improvement in the financing of\ninvestor properties.\nA step in the right direction is a new loan product from Fannie Mae that allows a cash-out\nrefinance of properties purchased with cash within the past six months, helping to “recycle” investor\ndollars through the market. But more could be done. Two possibilities include allowing investors to\naccess FHA 203(k) purchase-rehab loans and increasing the cap on the number of Freddie Mac loans\nthat are available to a single investor. In short, improving access to credit for responsible investors to\npurchase and improve properties would not only help provide affordable rental housing. It would also\nhelp to boost housing demand and limit some of the collateral problems from the large supply of\nvacant homes.17\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nA third way to help today’s housing market would be to provide as much certainty as possible\nregarding future government policy in this area. The GSEs are likely to play a different role in the\nnew system.18 The uncertainty has real effects on how well our current system works. A case in point\nconcerns GSE repurchase requests on delinquent loans.19\nFinally, I would like to be able to guarantee that the United States will never again suffer a\nsignificant house-price decline. But instead I can suggest some improvements that could make the\nhousing market of the future more robust in the face of disruptive shocks. One suggestion concerns\nspeeding up20 the resolution of delinquent mortgages that have no hope of becoming current again.\nThe government’s Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternative program (HAFA) is intended to speed\nthe resolution of troubled homeownerships by offering monetary incentives to borrowers and\nservicers who agree to short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. But like the larger HAMP program,\ntake-up rates for HAFA have been disappointing.21\nThe ultimate solution may be to rethink the foreclosure process from the start, and economic\ntheory could play a role here.22 By influencing the costs and benefits of non-foreclosure transfers, a\nnew system of ownership transfer might better align the incentives of borrowers and lenders, while\nstill protecting the legitimate property rights of homeowners. If so, society as a whole would benefit.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I would reiterate that problems in the housing sector of the U.S. economy have\nbeen a major impediment to recovery. As you know, we took significant actions last week at the\nFOMC to promote a faster recovery in the housing sector and the economy more broadly. 23\nI am very supportive of the actions, which were designed to promote stronger growth and\nreduce unemployment rates, consistent with our dual mandate, by putting downward pressure on\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nlonger-term interest rates and helping make financial conditions more accommodative. The actions\nannounced last week involve extending the average maturity of our holdings of securities, by selling\n$400 billion of Treasury securities with maturities of less than three years, and purchasing $400\nbillion in securities with maturities of from six to thirty years. I would highlight that 29 percent of the\nsecurities being purchased are in the maturity range over 20 years.\nThe FOMC also announced that to support conditions in mortgage markets we will now\nreinvest principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities\nin agency mortgage-backed securities, rather than purchasing Treasury securities.\nThere was a substantial market reaction to the announcement. Thirty-year Treasury yields\ndeclined by 18 basis points and thirty-year mortgage rates declined by 22 basis points that day – and\nfell further the following day.\nPictured in Figure 16 is the spread between the 30-year mortgage yield (a wholesale yield)\nand the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread illustrates in part what the Fed's actions are addressing –\nthe upward movement in the spread since mid 2011 – and the market's reaction, a 17-basis-point drop\nin the spread, following the Fed’s announcement. Since some of this action had been anticipated and\nalready reflected in market prices, I view this as a very significant decline.\nWhile there are a variety of impacts that lower long-term Treasury and mortgage yields can\nhave, certainly one is encouraging more refinancing and home purchases than would happen in the\nabsence of action. In my own view, the Federal Reserve should continue to closely monitor spreads\nbetween mortgage and Treasury yields and consider taking action if that spread widens significantly,\nas it had recently.\nWhile the housing sector and the economy would have been weaker in the absence of the\nFed’s actions to lower rates, I believe it is equally important to examine housing policies that might be\nchanged to reduce the impediments to monetary policy and more generally help facilitate recovery.\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nThere should be strong encouragement for the GSEs to focus on the housing recovery so home buyers\nand those that already have loans can fully benefit from the lower interest rates generated by our\nmonetary policy action. Given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently under conservatorship\nby the U.S. government, I believe they should play a larger role in achieving the public policy goals\ninherent in addressing these housing-market problems.\nWhile monetary policy cannot fully offset the many problems stemming from the recession, it\ncan certainly mitigate some of the effects. A policy action that, for instance, reduces the\nunemployment rate by half a percent over time will not return the economy to full employment, of\ncourse, but will still mean 750,000 jobs that would not have been created in the absence of the action.\nOf course, carefully weighing the potential costs of additional action with the expected potential\nbenefits involves a high degree of uncertainty, given we have not operated at the zero bound with\nfalling housing prices in the post-war period. However, with unemployment at 9.1 percent and with\ninflation in the medium term expected to remain below 2 percent, monetary and fiscal policies should\nbe focused on returning the economy to full employment.\nGiven what I have laid out today, let me close with this. We need to recognize the urgency of\nthe situation and the broader economic implications of housing’s continued struggles. All parties in\nthese markets should redouble their efforts, given the broader economic effects and their painful toll.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nNot to mention some European countries.\n\n2\n\nResidential investment is the housing component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Excluding immigrants, the\ndecline in median net worth is a lesser 31 percent, to $116,555. Immigration does not have a similar effect on estimates\nfor white, black, or Hispanic households.\n8\n\nThe Pew study by Rakesh Kochhar, Richard Fry and Paul Taylor was published on July 26, 2011, and entitled \"Wealth\nGaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics.\" See http://pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealthgaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/\n9\n\nThe statement, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm, noted that\nconsistent with its mandate, “The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters than\nit did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward\nlevels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate” to foster maximum employment and price\nstability. “The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those\nconsistent with the Committee's dual mandate.” The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate\nat 0 to 1/4 percent and “currently anticipates that economic conditions – including low rates of resource utilization and a\nsubdued outlook for inflation over the medium run – are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds\nrate at least through mid-2013.”\n10\n\nGiven median income, relative to the income needed to purchase the median priced home.\n\n11\n\nAnd if anything, household formation has not kept up with population growth, suggesting a growing pent-up demand for\nhomes.\n12\n\nSee http://www.corelogic.com/about-us/news/new-corelogic-data-reveals-q2-negative-equity-declines-in-hardest-hitmarkets-and-8-million-negative-equity-borrowers-have-above.aspx\n13\n\nCoreLogic gets the 5.1 percent number by noting that the current mortgage rate is roughly 4.1 percent, then adding a\n100 basis-point “refinance trigger.” Refinances are costly even under normal circumstances, so there has to be a nontrivial difference between the existing rate and the new rate in order for a refinance to make financial sense.\n14\n\nThe fraction of negative-equity mortgages paying above 5.1 percent is 74.3 percent (8.1 million out of a total 10.9\nmillion underwater mortgages). For positive-equity mortgages the figure is 53.1 percent (19.9 million out of 37.5 million\npositive-equity mortgages). Again, see CoreLogic’s release, at http://www.corelogic.com/about-us/news/new-corelogicdata-reveals-q2-negative-equity-declines-in-hardest-hit-markets-and-8-million-negative-equity-borrowers-haveabove.aspx.\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\n15\n\nSee the statement of the agency’s acting director at http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/22607/HARPSTMT9911.pdf\n\n16\n\nVacant homes frequently are vandalized and poorly maintained, quickly reducing the value of the home as well as\nimpacting homes in the surrounding area. A large stock of vacant homes is likely to continue to put downward pressure\non houses in many areas.\n17\n\nSeparately, see the proceedings of the conference REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood\nStabilization, cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland and the Federal Reserve Board,\navailable at http://www.bostonfed.org/commdev/REO-and-vacant-properties/index.htm\n18\n\nIn February, the Obama administration released a roadmap for fundamental GSE reform that outlined three potential\napproaches, but there is still substantial uncertainty about what will happen next. This document, titled “Reforming\nAmerica’s Housing Finance Market: A Report to Congress,” is available at\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/Reforming%20America%27s%20Housing%20Finance%20Market.pdf.\n19\n\nThe GSEs regularly review delinquent loans to ensure that their loan files are consistent with the representations and\nwarranties made by originators. In cases where the GSEs believe the loan file does not match what the originator\npromised, the GSEs can issue a repurchase request. As delinquencies have risen, so have the number of these buyback\nrequests. Many have argued that concern over buybacks has made originators less willing to issue certain types of loans.\nOver the long run, economic theory would predict that market participants could work out a solution to this problem. For\nexample, third-party firms could arise to offer insurance to originators against buybacks. Alternatively, the originators and\nthe GSEs could find ways of doing business that would better capture the mutual gains from trade. But these market\nsolutions are less likely to come about if mortgage-market participants are uncertain about the future role of the GSEs.\n20\n\nAccording to the August 2011 Mortgage Monitor, published by Lender Processing Services, Inc., foreclosure timelines\nhave lengthened significantly during the past three years. In July 2011, the average mortgage in foreclosure was\ndelinquent for 599 days, up from 319 days in January 2009 [The LPS Mortgage Monitor, published by LPS Applied\nAnalytics, is available at\nhttp://www.lpsvcs.com/LPSCorporateInformation/ResourceCenter/PressResources/Pages/MortgageMonitor.aspx. The\nAugust 2011 Monitor includes data through the end of July. The days-delinquent statistic quoted in the text appears on\nslide 3.]. Also, foreclosure delays tend to be especially serious in states that require judicial involvement.\n21\n\nA report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (which funds HAFA) reports that far\nmore short sales and deeds-in-lieu have taken place outside of HAFA than in it. See p. 67 of the SIGTARP’s July 2011\nQuarterly Report to Congress, available at\nhttp://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2011/July2011_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf.\nThis report states: “As of June 30, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data available, approximately $37.9\nmillion from TARP had been paid to investors, borrowers, and servicers in connection with 10,280 short sales or deeds-inlieu of foreclosure transfers completed under HAFA. As of May 31, 2011, which according to Treasury is the latest data\navailable, Treasury reported that the 10 largest servicers alone had completed 112,525 short sales and deeds-in-lieu\noutside HAMP for borrowers whose HAMP trial modifications had failed, borrowers who had chosen not to participate, or\nwere ineligible for the program.” The most recent data on the number of HAFA transactions is available from the U.S.\nTreasury at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx. While\ndocumentation requirements and other regulations in HAFA may be responsible for much of this difference, the Special\nInspector General’s report suggests that the difference could result in part by the ability of servicers to collect fees and\ndeficiency judgments for non-HAFA transactions. Deficiency judgments are not permitted in the HAFA program.\nNotably, many HAFA requirements have recently been relaxed. For example, as of February 1, servicers of non-GSE\nmortgages participating in HAFA are no longer required to verify a borrower’s financial information, or to determine that\nhis monthly mortgage payment exceeded 31 percent of his monthly income. However, servicers must continue to obtain a\nsigned affidavit indicating that the borrower has experienced some sort of financial hardship. See page 2 of the Making\nHome Affordable Program’s Supplemental Directive 10-18\n(https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/programs/docs/hafa/sd1018.pdf).\n22\n\nBorrowers currently have few incentives to speed the transfer of ownership. They can live “rent free” during the\nforeclosure process, and recent research from the Fair Issac Corporation (FICO) suggests that short sales and deeds-in-lieu\n\n16\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Weds., Sept. 28, 2011, at 2:40 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:40 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nwith deficiencies are just as damaging to credit scores as foreclosures. [For the effect of foreclosure alternatives on FICO\nscores, see “Research Looks at How Mortgage Delinquencies Affect Scores,” on FICO’s Banking Analytics blog:\nhttp://bankinganalyticsblog.fico.com/2011/03/research-looks-at-how-mortgage-delinquencies-affect-scores.html.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Global Interdependence Center’s\nConference on Capital Markets in the Post Crisis Environment\nStockholm, Sweden\nSeptember 29, 2011\n\nI am very happy to be with you for this substantive conference on capital markets in the “postcrisis” environment. It is vital for policymakers and practitioners to study and apply the recent\nlessons of financial interdependence, given the obvious effects on public wellbeing. So I am glad to\nbe able to join you in these discussions. And I commend the Global Interdependence Center for\norganizing this event, and others like it.\nI should note, of course, that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those\nof my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC). That is a standard disclaimer for Fed officials, but I really do mean it. My\ncomments should not be construed as official Fed perspectives or policy, but rather one person’s\ncarefully considered perspectives, based on much study. Let me also mention that my charts, and the\nanalysis I will share with you today, are all built on publicly available data.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nMy intent today is to offer up some constructive observations that I believe will help us move\ntowards greater financial stability, to the benefit of all. We need to create a more stable financial\ninfrastructure and I believe we can, in a thoughtful manner.\nFor the second time in four years, problems with financial institutions have captured the\nattention not only of economists, but also the mainstream press and the public at large. Given the\nimportance of credit to economic performance, we should reflect on why our financial system seems\nso susceptible to shocks, and on how we can strengthen its resilience so government intervention is no\nlonger necessitated by such shocks. My hope is that bankers and central bankers can once again be\nrelegated from the front pages of our newspapers to the business sections.\nYesterday I had an opportunity to participate in an economic outlook forum and discuss some\nof the challenges in the real economy – specifically in housing – that we are trying to address in the\nUnited States. Today I’d like to shift somewhat from the real economy directly, and focus on more\nunderlying financial-market challenges.\nIt goes without saying that this is an important time to be discussing financial markets. Global\nfinancial markets are being buffeted by concerns about the challenges facing various financial\ninstitutions, in part as a result of issues with fiscal imbalances in a number of countries. This\nheightened uncertainty is occurring despite the aggressive monetary policy actions taken in response\nto the recent recession – actions that at first blush would seemingly mitigate some of these challenges.\nConsistent with our mandate, the Federal Reserve acted aggressively when financial\ndisruptions emerged and the economy faltered. After cutting the federal funds rate essentially as far\nas possible, the Fed took less traditional policy actions, again to pursue our mandate. Figure 1 shows\nthat bank reserves in the United States have increased dramatically. We have increased the size of the\nFederal Reserve balance sheet, providing over a trillion dollars in additional bank reserves – yet even\nso, dollar funding markets have experienced strains.\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nFigure 2 highlights that interbank markets are showing more strains as the spread between the\n3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight index swap rate has widened.\nThis is happening even though most banks are loath to post higher rates for fear of signaling financial\nchallenges.\nAlso reflective of the current strain is Figure 3, which essentially shows the cost of utilizing\nderivatives contracts to secure dollar funding. It shows the spread between the 3-month dollar cash\nrate implied by a 3-month euro-dollar FX swap, and 3-month dollar LIBOR. Under normal\nconditions the line should be quite close to zero, but during periods of dollar funding problems, the\nspread can widen. As the chart shows, the spread is now at the widest it has been in the past several\nyears.\nSo how can there be a shortage of dollar funding at a time when there are so many bank\nreserves? One answer lies in the structure of short-term funding markets – a structure that has\nevolved to a state that is, unfortunately, particularly sensitive to liquidity shocks.\nToday I will highlight that the structure of the U.S. money market mutual fund (MMMF)\nindustry1 -- and the practice of many financial institutions to fund long-term dollar assets with shortterm dollar liabilities – have both helped make the global financial system susceptible to liquidity\nshocks and (relatedly) to changes in the perceived credit risk of market participants.\nI will first discuss the role that MMMFs play in providing short-term funding, including\nserving as an important source of short-term financing for European banks. I will highlight that the\ncurrent structure makes MMMFs particularly susceptible to credit shocks that can turn into liquidity\nproblems for the whole industry – and will suggest some ways that the industry could be made more\nresilient.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAnd I will then turn to the practice among some European banks of funding long-term dollar\nassets with short-term paper purchased by MMMFs. This too, has proved to be a structure that makes\nshort-term credit markets susceptible to liquidity shocks.\nI will conclude with some general observations about the current stresses in financial markets.\n\nThe Role of Money Market Mutual Funds in Short-Term Credit Markets\nMMMFs are mutual funds that provide investors the ability to invest in a diversified set of\nshort-term credit-market instruments. Because MMMFs generally invest in highly liquid, high\nquality, short-term credit instruments they are not required to alter their net value to reflect small\nmovements in underlying asset values. The resulting stable (versus floating) net asset value makes\nthe investments attractive to investors looking for a transactional account that generally has paid a\nsomewhat higher return than comparable bank products.\nLike other mutual funds, MMMFs are not required to hold any capital as protection against\nadverse movements in the value of the assets they hold. This absence of capital, together with the\nstable net asset value, results in a structure that despite its appeal in other ways is prone to shareholder\n“runs” during times of financial stresses.\nMMMFs have been viewed as appealingly safe investment vehicles for investors seeking\nhighly liquid investment opportunities. As a condition of transacting at a stable net asset value, the\nMMMFs, which are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are required to\nmaintain significant liquidity ratios and are limited in the duration and credit ratings of the financial\ninstruments they can hold.2, 3\nMMMFs are critical players in short-term credit markets. They have been very significant\nbuyers of commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. MMMFs\nhave provided an important source of financing for organizations dependent on wholesale financing,\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nincluding branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. – I will discuss them in a\nmoment – and others that issue short-term credit instruments to finance longer-term dollardenominated assets.\nAs Figure 4 illustrates, MMMFs are sizeable participants in financial markets with about $2.5\ntrillion of assets under management. They grew rapidly for much of the last decade, but encountered\nsignificant problems in the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers. One MMMF, the Reserve\nPrimary Fund, had a position in Lehman Brothers and was unable to maintain a fixed net asset value\n(“broke the buck”) after Lehman failed and the value of its commercial paper plummeted. This led to\nrapid withdrawals from many MMMFs (a “run”) as investors became concerned that other MMMFs\nwould not be able to maintain their stable net asset value.\nIn response to the rapid withdrawals, the U.S. Treasury announced a temporary insurance\nprogram for MMMFs. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston administered on behalf of the Federal\nReserve System a lending facility that was designed to address the short-term liquidity needs of\nMMMFs and help stabilize short-term credit markets that were disrupted by the rapid liquidation of\ninvestments by many MMMFs.4,5 These efforts proved successful at restoring stability and avoiding\nfurther harm, and all of the loans were repaid with interest.6\nSince then, balances at MMMFs have gradually declined – by more than a trillion dollars from\ntheir peak – over the past three years in response to the historically low interest rate environment and\ncorresponding returns.\nFigure 5 shows the three major categories of MMMFs, determined by the assets in which they\ninvest. The prime money market funds are the largest category, with approximately $1.5 trillion in\nassets. The prime funds have the most flexibility in investing and are allowed to hold commercial\npaper, jumbo CDs,7 and asset-backed commercial paper as well as government-backed securities.\nThe second largest category, with approximately $850 million in assets, involves MMMFs that invest\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nin U.S. Treasury and agency securities. These funds have lower credit risk, but also generate lower\nreturns. The smallest category involves MMMFs that provide tax-free returns to investors.\nAt the time of the Lehman Brothers failure, prime MMMFs that had credit-sensitive investors\nand exposure to large financial institutions experienced the largest and most rapid redemptions.8\nMany investor outflows from prime funds were redirected to MMMFs that were government-only\nfunds.\nMMMFs have substantially increased their liquidity over the last year. In part this reflects a\ntightening of liquidity requirements by the SEC, but it also reflects the realization among MMMF\nmanagers that during times of significant liquidity risk, they need to maintain a more defensive\nposture. As Figure 6 shows, prime funds have been increasing their holdings of short-maturity assets\nof late – in part, one assumes, as a result of the debt ceiling concerns in the U.S. and the funding\nworries related to governments and financial institutions in Europe.\nSince MMMFs have increased liquidity in an environment of very low returns on short-term\ncredit instruments, their returns to investors have been squeezed further. Figure 7 illustrates the\nimpact on MMMF returns. The first line in the table provides the average yields for the five highest\nyielding MMMFs, and the second line provides the average yields for the next five highest yielding\nfunds. The table highlights that while the gross yield averages about 40 basis points for the five\nhighest yielding MMMFs, investors are only getting a net yield of only five basis points.\nMMMFs have purchased a large amount of foreign-bank securities. But as Figure 8 shows,\nmost MMMFs have been reducing their exposure to European banks that the market may see as\nposing more significant credit risks. Some of the reductions have been quite dramatic, and MMMFs\nare no longer holding short-term credit instruments issued by institutions headquartered in the most\nfinancially strained countries. They have greatly reduced the size of their overall exposure, and have\nalso significantly reduced the maturity they are willing to hold.\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nHowever, one of the challenges for the MMMF industry is that, just as in the fall of 2008, a\nvery few aggressive MMMFs – maybe even one – could under certain circumstances encounter\ntrouble that ends up ratcheting up redemption requests across the industry.\nNo one wants to see a repeat of 2008, nor should we. The industry and all participants can get\nto a better place. For example, an examination of the publicly available monthly reports on portfolio\nholdings of MMMFs highlights that a few MMMFs hold financial paper that has not been\ndowngraded but nonetheless is seen by the market as posing more credit risk than could seem\nappropriate for entities that are allowed to maintain a fixed net asset value.\nMMMFs have been required to provide a monthly report of holdings and have increased their\nliquidity. Still, we are passing the three-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman and the run on the\nMMMFs and it remains important to explore the ways that the industry, which plays a pivotal role in\nshort-term credit markets, can address its susceptibility to a credit shock that could in turn be\ntransmitted to short-term financial markets. I am not saying anything that has not been expressed\nbefore, but want to highlight the opportunities we all have to move thoughtfully but expeditiously to a\nmore stable place.\nGiven all this, I believe a more proactive regulatory approach may be necessary. While the\nmonthly reporting has been helpful, given the very short maturity of many of the assets, I believe the\nreporting should be more frequent to avoid the possibility of “window dressing” at the end of the\nmonth. Also, reducing a fund’s maximum permissible exposure to any one firm could reduce the\npotential loss that would occur from a credit event involving only one counterparty. Consideration\nmight also be given to whether the assets of riskier firms (for example those with very high market\ncredit default swaps (“CDS”) prices are appropriate investments for MMMFs, which are expected to\nmaintain a low risk profile.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nThere have been a variety of proposals recommending more substantial changes in this arena.\nHowever, three years after a systemically significant episode, no one proposal has been settled on.\nMy own preferred approach would be to require MMMFs to have a meaningful capital-like\nbuffer that exceeds, for example, their single-issuer concentration exposure limits – perhaps on the\norder of 2 to 3 percent – that, if violated, automatically leads to a fund’s conversion to a floating net\nasset value. Examples of how to structure such a buffer include having the MMMF’s sponsor directly\nfund the creation of the buffer, or creating a separate class of loss-absorbing shares that could be\nmarketed to investors willing to bear some risk in exchange for a higher return than that provided by\nthe stable value shares. If in some appropriate period of time a satisfactory plan for such a capital\nbuffer is not produced and accepted, then those prime funds would be required to float their net asset\nvalue.\nAll in all, though, given the systemic importance of the MMMF industry, it is critical that one\nway or another we make the industry less susceptible to credit shocks and liquidity runs. While many\nin the MMMF industry have been reducing their exposure to troubled financial institutions, some\ncontinue to take what some observers might consider outsized credit risks. The experience of 2008\nshowed the potential for a MMMF’s problems to precipitate redemptions that are ultimately\ndestabilizing to short-term credit markets, and contribute to economic difficulties. I am certainly not\npredicting any such outcome but noting that policymakers, market participants, and the industry can\nand should make steady progress on these matters.\n\nForeign Branches and Agencies in the United States\nThe consideration of MMMFs is intertwined with another issue of systemic risk that I would\nlike to discuss – the dependence, to a large degree, of foreign branches and agencies in the U.S. on\nshort-term wholesale funding.\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nLet me first note that while I will raise some concerns in this arena, we are beginning to\naddress them within the existing statutory framework. However, over time other structural remedies\nmay be warranted and possible.\nUnlike domestic banks or foreign bank subsidiaries in the U.S., foreign branches and agencies\nare not allowed to have U.S. deposit insurance and thus cannot rely on insured retail deposits as a\nfunding source. In addition, foreign banks are ineligible for membership in, and receiving secured\nfunds from, the Federal Home Loan banks – which have been an important source of liquidity for\nmany domestic banks. As a result, they are especially reliant on wholesale funding – that is, raising\nfunds by issuing jumbo certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements; all of\nwhich during times of stress are less stable than typical retail deposit accounts.9\nParenthetically, I would note that foreign branches are not required to directly hold any capital\nwith their U.S. operations. I will say more on this in a moment.\nWhile wholesale funding is an important part of a bank’s liability structure, an excessive\nreliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance long-term assets can be problematic. In\nparticular, in situations where wholesale financing is not available, foreign branches can find it\ndifficult to raise required dollar funding and the foreign parent may not be able to fill the funding gap\neffectively. This is one of the reasons why foreign banks were among the most aggressive users of\nthe Fed’s liquidity facilities and Discount Window in the wake of the run on MMMFs in the fall of\n2008.\nForeign branches and agencies utilize wholesale dollar deposits for two main purposes. First,\nthey use the short-term wholesale deposits to fund longer-term U.S. dollar bank loans and securities\nholdings. They frequently fund large corporate borrowing needs. Second, the branches are often used\nto raise dollar funding for their global parent. Thus, branches frequently provide longer-term funding\nto their parent to fund dollar assets the parent is holding outside of the branch.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nI will say a fair amount about foreign branches today, so I want to stress that the focus stems\nfrom the important and useful function that they serve as a source of finance in our global economy.\nFigure 9 provides the major components of foreign branch assets. These are principally loans\nand leases and securities holdings such as high-grade corporate securities. In addition, you can see\nthat foreign banks have been attempting to increase their liquidity in case their access to wholesale\nfunding becomes constrained – as reflected in the sharp increase in cash and bank reserves.\nFigure 10 provides the major components of foreign branch liabilities. Roughly 75 percent of\nbranch liabilities are generated by jumbo deposits, commercial paper and other borrowing, including\nfinancing through repurchase agreements. One of the primary sources of these funds are the\nMMMFs.\nUsing shorter-term wholesale funding (in branches) to fund longer-term assets held by the\nbranch or the parent proved problematic in the fall of 2008. The investor run on money market funds\nforced the funds to stop acquiring new (and “rolling over” existing) jumbo deposits and commercial\npaper, causing a serious funding problem for the issuing entities. Short-term credit markets became\nseverely stressed, requiring significant government intervention to restore liquidity to the market.\nConcerns over problems in Europe are once again posing a problem for the strategy of shortterm wholesale funding of longer-term U.S. dollar assets. Despite the large supply of bank reserves I\nmentioned earlier, a reduction in MMMF financing has once again resulted in a problem for\nwholesale dollar funding. The recent announcement of several central banks that they would provide\nlonger-term dollar financing has once again highlighted that short-term credit markets are, in my own\nopinion, overly dependent on structures that are highly sensitive to credit and liquidity conditions.\nOver time it will be important to get to a place where adequate funding flows do not require official\nintervention during times of stress.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAs with MMMFs, a greater focus on financial stability should cause a re-evaluation of\nstructures with no direct capital and a clear reliance on rolling over short-term liabilities to fund\nlonger-term assets. The foreign branch system is important because of the role it plays in U.S. credit\nmarkets and also because of the dollar funding it facilitates for foreign banks, facilitating global\ncommerce. However, it does suffer from some of the same problems as the money market funds.\nThere are a number ways to try to reduce these liquidity problems associated with the current\nbranch structure. Clearly this issue requires much careful thought and analysis, so what I’ll suggest\ntoday should be viewed only as examples of possible approaches that could be taken.\nOne supervisory approach could be to preserve the current branch structure but take steps to\nreduce funding risks in various ways.10 It may be advisable to require greater liquidity from global\nparents. And I would note that several of the Basel III Capital Accord’s liquidity measures will make\nreliance on wholesale funding less attractive.11\nSecondly, regulatory approaches that have been taken in some countries require foreign\nbranches to hold capital, or require all bank operations to be under a separate holding company\nstructure with capital to support the entirety of domestic operations in the country. Requiring capital\nfor all domestic operations of foreign banks has costs.12 But it is one option, worthy of study.\nBoth of these approaches would in all likelihood cause firms to reconsider whether a more\nstable funding model – for example a more stable mix of funds including wholesale, insured, and\nlonger-term debt – could be superior to purely wholesale funding.\nWhile we should actively consider a variety of options, my personal preference would be to\nmove towards all foreign banking operations requiring some form of bank capital. This approach\ncould reduce the liquidity crises that have occurred episodically, and could also address the possibility\nthat as some banks have become large relative to the size of their countries, it could be difficult for\nparents to back up branches during a crisis.\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nAll in all, I would suggest that the financial stability issues raised in 2008, and which have\nbecome increasingly prevalent of late, require a reexamination of issues that influence the stability of\nshort-term credit markets.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum and in conclusion, short-term credit markets have become increasingly susceptible to\nrapid shifts in sentiment – shifts that can create global liquidity problems. The structure of MMMFs,\neven with improvements that make them less at risk of runs, can still cause problems – for example if\nMMMFs move assets quickly out of certain segments of wholesale funding markets. This could\nhappen because of increased credit concerns on the part of either money-market investors or moneymarket managers.\nAnd foreign banks that have become dependent on MMMFs and other sources of wholesale\nfunding are another concern. As in 2008, now in 2011 we are seeing dollar shortages as MMMFs\nshun some financial institutions with various exposures to troubles in Europe – a situation that is\nhaving a negative impact on short-term credit markets.\nAll in all, the global banking system currently remains more vulnerable than it should and\ncould be. And more than just the liquidity structure is problematic. Some global banks appear to\nhave lost the confidence of more than the MMMFs. Share prices have fallen dramatically for some\nbank stocks, and credit default swap prices for some global banks are at elevated levels.\nBank supervisors worldwide may do more to utilize these market signals when deciding\nwhether banks should be allowed to issue dividends or make share repurchases. Using market\ntriggers as well as capital triggers to prevent capital from leaving the banking system (or to bolster it\nas necessary) during times of stress should be revisited. Should market assessments be wrong, banks\nwould only have deferred dividends or share repurchases. They could be resumed at a higher level\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\nonce the problems are resolved. Furthermore, using publicly observed signals to trigger a cessation of\ndividends may have less of a market impact than dividend reductions based on management\njudgment.13\nAllowing dividends and share repurchases to occur when the risk of a crisis is high allows\nscarce capital to leave the banking system at a time when it is most needed. Such a policy risks that\ntaxpayers, debt holders, and the economy will suffer should bank capital be insufficient to weather the\ncrisis.\nIf market triggers were hit and bank supervisors became concerned about credit availability\nfrom the financial system, in certain circumstances they could choose to suspend dividends and stock\nrepurchases for all systemically important banks. This would retain capital in the banking system and\nallow the stronger banks to continue their important role as financial intermediaries at a time when\nsome of their peers are constrained by their financial problems. While Basel III has proposed dividend\nreductions as capital becomes depleted, I suspect that is likely to be too late, given the slow pace at\nwhich accounting losses are realized.\nIt has become clear that financial stability is too central to the performance of economies not\nto explore options for moving forward and reducing instability. We need to move constructively and\nprudently to a better place, and I believe we can and should.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe analysis presented here includes 2a-7 funds but, in fact, a broader definition of money funds can be considered\nwhen discussing the structure and the sensitivity to liquidity shocks.\n2\n\nUnder section 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act – that is, under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 2a-7 (17\nCFR 270.2a-7) issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Rule 2a-7).\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Thurs., Sept. 29, 2011, at 2:50 AM U.S. Eastern Time & 8:50 AM in Stockholm, Sweden; or upon delivery *\n\n3\n\nThey cannot hold securities with a maturity greater than 13 months, and the average maturity of their assets cannot\nexceed 90 days. The securities have to be of low credit risk, and a fund can have no more than 5 percent of its assets with\nany one issuer.\n4\n\nGiven the disruptions, the Federal Reserve System announced an asset-backed commercial paper MMMF liquidity\nfacility. The facility, operated for the System by the Boston Fed, allowed money market funds to sell asset-backed\ncommercial paper to banks – the MMMFs could use the sale proceeds to meet redemption requests – and the asset-backed\ncommercial paper was pledged by the banks to the Fed as part of a loan from the Fed, which was ultimately paid back\nwith interest.\n5\n\nFor more on this episode see my remarks at the Stanford Finance Forum in June:\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm\n6\n\nSee “How Effective Were the Federal Reserve Emergency Liquidity Facilities? Evidence from the Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility” (QAU Working Paper No. QAU10-3\nby Burcu Duygan-Bump, Patrick M. Parkinson, Eric S. Rosengren, Gustavo A. Suarez, and Paul S. Willen). The working\npaper explains that following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, short-term credit markets were severely\ndisrupted. In response, the Federal Reserve implemented new and unconventional facilities to help restore liquidity. Many\nexisting analyses of these interventions are confounded by identification problems because they rely on aggregate data.\nTwo unique micro datasets allow us to exploit both time series and cross-sectional variation to evaluate one of the most\nunusual of these facilities—the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF).\nThe AMLF extended collateralized loans to depository institutions that purchased asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)\nfrom money market funds, helping these funds meet the heavy redemptions that followed Lehman’s bankruptcy. The\nprogram, which lent $150 billion in its first 10 days of operation, was wound down with no credit losses to the Federal\nReserve. Our findings indicate that the facility was effective as measured against its dual objectives: it helped stabilize\nasset outflows from money market mutual funds, and it improved liquidity in the ABCP market. Using a differences-indifferences approach we show that after the facility was implemented, money market fund outflows decreased more for\nthose funds that held more eligible collateral. Similarly, we show that yields on AMLF-eligible ABCP decreased\nsignificantly relative to those on otherwise comparable AMLF-ineligible commercial paper.\n7\n\nSome funds restrict their investments to FDIC insured CDs. The foreign branch CDs tend to be jumbos.\n\n8\n\nThese are shareholders redeeming their equity investments.\n\n9\n\nDuring times of stress it may also be more difficult to rely on the foreign parent organization for support, as it may be\nunder stress as well.\n10\n\nSteps could include increasing liquidity concentration; limiting the level of receivables from related entities; requiring\nthat any such receivables be collateralized by high-quality assets held at the parent; increasing diversification in third party\nfunding; establishing funding tenor limits, so that branches hold less shorter-term wholesale funding; requiring that\nbranches collateralize some of their third party funding with high-quality collateral; and requiring branches to better match\nthe tenor of assets with the tenor of liabilities they hold.\n\n11\n\nHowever, in this regard it depends upon how the rules for “significant currencies” are enforced.\n\n12\n\nFor example, banks would have less flexibility to move liquidity and capital across borders, and maintaining separate\nrisk analysis by country could raise costs for global banks.\n13\n\nSince by construction the public trigger approach conveys no negative information about the bank’s earnings prospects\nbeyond what the market already knows.\n\n14\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2011 AT 2:50 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Global Financial Intermediaries:\nLessons and Continuing Challenges”\nAddress at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston’s\n56th Economic Conference:\nThe Long-Term Effects\nof the Great Recession\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 19, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nI’d like to reiterate the welcome to conference participants that I offered yesterday.\nThank you for being here to take part in this conference on the long-term effects of what many\nhave come to call, sadly, the “Great Recession.” I hope that the ideas and analysis exchanged at\nthis conference will help alleviate the effects of this downturn and the slow recovery, as well as\nhelp prevent future problems from causing so much hardship for so many.\n\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI should mention that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of\nmy colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (the FOMC).\nAs I – and others – have noted many times, a key lesson from the recent downturn and\nprior financial crises is that problems in financial institutions and financial markets can and do\nspill over to the real economy, very significantly. Policymakers must worry about the financial\nsystem and markets because problems there can disrupt the financial intermediation on which\nmarket economies depend.1 When this happens the economy suffers, and the economic\nprospects of its participants.\nGiven the severity of the recession that followed the recent financial crisis, it is crucial\nthat our financial infrastructure becomes resilient enough so that financial intermediation can\ncontinue, regardless of a shock, without extraordinary intervention from the public sector (the\ngovernment and, ultimately, taxpayers). During 2007 and 2008, the U.S. Congress, Treasury\ndepartment, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve all took\nextraordinary actions to avoid a more-severe financial crisis and more damage to economic\nprospects. Despite this unprecedented public-policy response, the recession was long and severe\nand the recovery continues to be much slower than we would like. And the United States was\nnot unique in this respect. Many foreign governments and foreign central banks also took\nunprecedented action to try to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis in their countries.\nParticularly noteworthy is how many large global financial intermediaries experienced\nsevere distress. These institutions play a vital role in the credit flows and financial\nintermediation that underpin the global economy. They span national borders and presumably\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nhave the ability to be better diversified across products and geographic locations than smaller\ninstitutions or intermediaries doing business in just one country.\nBut because these global intermediaries are key players in many countries and in many\nfinancial markets, and because they are highly interconnected with other financial institutions,\nthey also serve as particularly efficient conductors or transmitters of shocks in one area to the\nwider global financial system. Unfortunately, such was the case with the major shock caused by\nresidential real estate problems in the U.S. More recently it appears to be the case with the\nsovereign debt problems in Europe.\nAs you know, there have been significant legislative and regulatory responses to the\nfinancial crisis that emerged in 2007. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank legislation made\nsignificant changes to frameworks for addressing systemically important financial institutions,\namong other things. Internationally, many of the impending Basel III rules are similarly\nintended to address some of the lessons of the financial crisis.\nI am very supportive of these efforts, but I suspect they can be strengthened and\nimproved. Indeed some countries, such as the U.K. and Switzerland, are fairly far along in\nestablishing standards that are higher than those required by Basel III. But in my view some\nsignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system in which\nno institution is “too big to fail” given the collateral damage its disorderly demise would cause to\neconomies and citizens.\nBefore the new domestic and international rules could be fully implemented, the world\nhas once again been buffeted by financial shocks, this time emanating in Europe. And once\nagain large financial intermediaries, despite all the positive roles they play in facilitating global\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncommerce, have been efficient in transmitting or conducting the shocks. As a result the world\neconomy has slowed, and stock prices of large financial intermediaries have fallen significantly.\nOnce again, governments have started to intervene to mitigate global banking problems,\nwhich in turn may stress the debt burden of those governments, and could ultimately undermine\nthe credit ratings of some countries. While the full impact of sovereign debt problems and their\nimpact on large financial intermediaries will not be known for some time, it is apparent that the\nfinancial intermediaries encompass some vulnerabilities for the world financial system and the\nglobal economy.\n\nConsidering the Large Financial Intermediaries\nGiven the key role that large financial intermediaries played in the crisis of 2007 and\n2008, as well as their role in the problems that have arisen more recently, it is important to\nunderstand why financial intermediaries contribute vulnerabilities to the global financial system.\nSo I’d like to provide some background on the large intermediaries and their potential for\nconducting shocks around the global economy.\nFigure 1 explores bank size relative to the size of the home country, specifically the asset\nsize of the largest bank in each country as a share of GDP.2 When financial intermediaries\nbecome large relative to the GDP of the home country, several potential challenges exist.3 First,\na large institution could essentially be “too big to save.” Should a global bank become insolvent\nand the home country need to recapitalize it – so that it can continue its crucial role in financial\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nintermediation within the economy – then the sheer scale of the required equity capital could\nstrain a country trying to raise sufficient funds to provide the equity.\nConsider a hypothetical example. A troubled two trillion dollar bank located in a country\nwhose GDP is also two trillion dollars would in all likelihood put the country in a position of\nneeding to issue government debt to finance an equity infusion. If the government recapitalized\nthe bank with 10 percent more capital, the nation’s debt to GDP ratio would increase by 10\npercent. If multiple banks failed at the same time, the national debt to GDP ratio would rise even\nfurther. Thus while government rescue of a bank may stem an individual institution’s crisis, it\ncan precipitate sovereign debt concerns.\nIreland’s recent experience is instructive. The Irish banks were not among the world’s\nlargest financial intermediaries, but they were large relative to the size of their home country’s\neconomy. Prior to its banking crisis, Ireland was a country with a relatively low debt to GDP,\nbut became a country with a high debt to GDP ratio – largely as a result of providing emergency\nequity support for its troubled banking sector.\nNow I would like to direct your attention to Figure 2, which shows the pricing on\nsovereign credit default swaps for a number of countries. Credit default swap (CDS) rates for\nmany countries are now very high by historical standards – meaning the cost of insuring against\na sovereign default has risen appreciably. While I know that thin trading in credit default swaps\nfor individual entities necessitates caution in their interpretation, the overall trend is clear. A\ncountry needing to recapitalize one or more of its financial intermediaries faces further fiscal\nstrain – potentially at a precarious time, when investors have already become more cautious\nabout trends in the country’s debt to GDP levels.\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAnother potential problem arises when investors have little confidence in a particular\nglobal bank or the home government. In this case, simply recapitalizing the bank may not be\nsufficient to address concerns, and additional financial support by the country may be necessary.\nFor example if depositors rapidly withdraw their deposits from a troubled bank, the home\ncountry may need to support deposit holders in addition to providing equity (capital) –\nparticularly in countries where deposit insurance regimes are not robust, or payment of\ndepositors’ claims is not timely.\nWhat’s more, a failure to support the liabilities of a troubled bank (in this case the\ndeposits) would potentially destabilize other banks in the country, even those with relatively\nhealthy balance sheets. Compared to simply infusing capital, supporting liabilities could require\nmuch larger expenditures by the home country and thus the home country would need to\ncontribute substantial additional funds.\nYet another issue concerns the reliance of large financial intermediaries on so-called\nwholesale financing arrangements. As you know, retail depositors are frequently covered (to\nvarying degrees) by deposit insurance, so in countries with credible deposit insurance\nframeworks, retail depositors covered by insurance are less likely to “run.” In contrast, however,\nwholesale funds – such as very large certificates of deposit, and commercial paper – tend to\nmove out of troubled banks relatively quickly. Thus banks that depend heavily on wholesale\nfunding can potentially experience a fairly sudden liquidity crisis. Such crises force\ngovernments to make quick decisions about providing support – decisions that have important\neconomic ramifications for their countries.\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nDiscussing these concerns is not an esoteric exercise. Figure 3 shows the average credit\ndefault swap spreads for largest financial intermediaries, in groups of five.4 As I just mentioned,\none needs to use caution in reading too much into credit default swap rates – but they do indicate\nthat similar to credit default swap spreads on countries, financial firms around the world have\nseen a marked increase in CDS spreads. The cost of insuring against default has gone up\nsubstantially relative to the beginning of the financial crisis. Suffice to say for many banks, the\nrates remain quite elevated at present.\nFigure 4 shows stock price declines at the largest bank by country (and for countries with\nmore than one bank in the top 20 in assets, the declines are averaged). Bank stock prices have\ndeclined substantially since the beginning of the year. Many large financial intermediaries have\nexperienced significant declines and market prices already reflect concerns with financial\nintermediaries outside and inside Europe. Figure 5 provides stock-price data on the largest\ninstitutions in Europe and the U.S., again in groups of five, including the average change from\nthe peak to the current level, and from the end of 2010 to the current level for each group of\nbanks.\n\nOutstanding Issues Related to Large Financial Intermediaries\nThe Basel III capital accord is designed to reduce the risk that large financial\nintermediaries will become troubled and require government intervention. While there are a\nvariety of proposed requirements in Basel III, two major initiatives include potentially raising\ncapital requirements for systemically important institutions – to reduce the probability they\nbecome insolvent – and improving the ability of large financial intermediaries to withstand\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nliquidity shocks. These are important and necessary improvements, and the overall accord is an\nimportant step in the right direction. Yet some important outstanding issues remain to be\naddressed. I would like to mention some key ones, which of course are more interrelated than\nstand-alone.\n\n1. Resolution of large financial intermediaries\nThe first outstanding issue involves the challenge of resolving a failing international\nfinancial institution. Different countries have very different bankruptcy frameworks and\nresolution arrangements, and these differences can significantly impact who gets payment in a\nrestructuring. These differences remain a major impediment to orderly resolution.5\nAs seen in Figure 6, related to absolute priority in liquidation, there are significant\ndifferences across countries, particularly related to the treatment of secured creditors and\nemployee claims. These differences mean that the place where funds “reside” in a global\norganization will determine which creditors get paid. Knowing this, there is the potential for the\norganization in danger of failure to shift funds (prior to closure) to countries where the treatment\nof particular classes of creditors is favorable to the organization.\nA disorderly failure of a global financial institution can be extremely damaging.\nCreditors may not know which jurisdictions hold valuable assets. They may be unclear on the\nprevailing bankruptcy rules, how these rules affect their positions, or how long their funds will\nbe tied up. The situation surrounding the failure of Lehmann Brothers is quite relevant here.\nThree years after the bankruptcy, significant litigation continues. Some creditors were impacted\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nby the movement of funds in the final days before bankruptcy, and many creditors still do not\nknow the amount they will receive or the timeframe in which they will be paid.\nThe failure of several Icelandic banks also highlights the problem. While small by\ninternational standards, the troubled banks were large relative to the size of the Icelandic\neconomy. Uncertainty about whether depositor claims (particularly foreign depositors’ claims)\nwould be satisfied – and by whom – highlights the difficulties that can emerge when even\nrelatively small institutions fail.\nSuch uncertainty could provide depositors and creditors with a strong incentive to remove\nfunds from a troubled global financial institution. This may mean that large financial\nintermediaries could be particularly susceptible to the rapid withdrawal of deposits due to\nuncertainty surrounding resolution. Needless to say, this is particularly problematic at a time of\nfinancial stress.\nIdeally, international agreements would govern cross-border claims on global institutions.\nHowever, as the table highlights, differences in national views on which creditors should get the\nhighest priority make obtaining an international agreement quite elusive, at least any time soon.\nThere are fundamental legal and cultural differences in national insolvency and resolution\nregimes – including differences in insolvency criteria; which parties can initiate an insolvency\nproceeding; whether the debtor or an administrator is in charge; the time for payment of claims;\nset-off and preference rules; and others.\nWhile a uniform approach to creditor hierarchy would arguably enhance financial\ninstitution resolution and financial stability efforts globally, the likelihood of harmonizing the\narray of entrenched national creditor hierarchies would seem to be unlikely in the near term.\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nMoreover, these differences are unique and important to individual countries. Consequently,\ninterim or alternative measures seem appropriate. But I hope I have helped illuminate a key\nchallenge that could make an orderly failure of a large institution potentially elusive.\n\n2. Wholesale financing of large financial intermediaries\nA second outstanding issue involves large financial intermediaries’ reliance on wholesale\nfunding arrangements. Many large financial intermediaries raise funds across international\nborders, so the location of their creditors may well differ from the location of their assets. This\nsituation is quite prevalent among many large European banks that have raised funds in the\nshort-term credit markets for commercial paper and jumbo certificates of deposit, in order to\nfund longer-term assets either in the United States or elsewhere in their global operations.6\nBut this practice of raising short-term dollar liabilities to fund longer-term dollar assets\ncan make the financial institution less stable if global creditors come to feel less certain about the\ninstitution’s prospects (or the prospects of a class of institutions). In fact, Figure 7 shows that\nthe cost of raising dollar liabilities through the use of foreign exchange swaps has increased\nsubstantially this year – an indicator of creditor concern about such institutions.\nThis reliance on wholesale liabilities – compared to retail liabilities like deposits that\nusually enjoy deposit insurance – makes a large financial intermediary more susceptible to\nliquidity pressures. This is precisely why the new Basel III requirements devote significant\nattention to the liquidity and funding strategies of large financial intermediaries.\n\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAdditionally, during periods of distress there is a natural incentive for regulators in a\ngiven country to “ring fence” some operations of a global bank within their borders – in other\nwords to prevent any bank assets from leaving the country in order to maximize funding\navailable to meet their liabilities to domestic creditors. Such a policy could make it difficult for\nlarge financial intermediaries to continue funding – particularly wholesale funding – across\nnational borders.\nAs long as the sources and uses of funds in such situations differ because of national\nborders and related regulatory and legal requirements, the ability to resolve a global bank will be\ncomplicated, giving rise to concerns about the risks of broad financial contagion. I would add\nthat if we are to avoid future crises and the need for extraordinary government intervention in\ncrises, then the issue of over-reliance on wholesale funding will need to be addressed.\n\n3. Protection of home country operations\nA third lingering issue concerns the protection of home country operations. An\nalternative being explored in the United Kingdom and in Switzerland – areas with global\nfinancial intermediaries that are large relative to their economies – is whether in some\ncircumstances the public sector will only support the domestic operations of their banks. By\nring-fencing responsibilities, the home country government will be better able to forestall a crisis\nin their country. However, other countries could be adversely affected if subsidiaries and\nbranches in their jurisdiction must “fend for themselves.”\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAgain, the Icelandic example highlights the problem of small countries supporting large\nfinancial intermediaries, and whether the home country and its regulatory authority and\ntaxpayers can be expected to be willing and able to serve as a source of strength should the bank\nbe in danger of failing, or fail. It is exactly these concerns that have caused some countries to\nrequire that all branches of foreign banks operating within their borders be supported by capital\n(sometimes referred to as full subsidiarization).\nThe benefits of creating a subsidiary with deposit insurance and access to the Federal\nHome Loan Bank system would likely change the nature of their U.S. operations. By requiring\ncapital against all assets in the country, financial firms are more likely to depend on a more\nstable mix of liabilities – including retail deposits, wholesale funding, and term debt – rather than\njust wholesale deposits. And the capital in the country would provide additional protection to\nmeet domestic claims should the global parent become troubled. Alternatively, the domestic\noperations would be more readily salable, which could potentially reduce the spread of\ndifficulties and limit the disruption of crucial financial intermediation. However, this solution\nalso comes at a cost – as risk management, liquidity management, capital management and\nregulatory requirements become more costly to the parent, since all financial operations in a\ncountry are now subject to the regulatory requirements of that host country.\n\n4. Reluctance to be proactive in retaining and raising additional capital\nA fourth outstanding issue involves the reluctance of bank management or regulators to\nbe proactive in retaining and raising additional capital for an institution or for groups of\ninstitutions. Basel III provides new restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends as their\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\ncapital becomes depleted. However, book and regulatory capital measures tend to be lagging\nindicators of the financial strength of the bank. Some financial intermediaries have experienced\nlarge declines in share prices and large increases in the pricing on credit default swaps, but still\ncontinue to pay dividends or buy back shares.\nGiven the support of governments to large financial intermediaries around the world in\n2008, a more proactive approach to retaining capital within organizations during times of stress\nis in my view warranted – a view I have expressed a number of times in various talks. If\ntaxpayer funds in a country may be used to bolster a bank due to its critical role as a financial\nintermediary in the country’s economy, that step should not manifest itself in paying scarce\nfunds to equity holders.\nMoving to a structure where an institution’s dividends are deferred during times of\nfinancial stress would greatly facilitate the increase of capital buffers at times when investors are\nconcerned with a given bank’s financial performance. Using easily observable financial triggers,\nsuch as very substantial declines in a firm’s stock price, to pause share repurchases and dividends\nwould provide no additional information about the institution’s financial strength – but would\nallow it to build up capital during times of stress.\nThe amount of necessary government support for large financial institutions globally\nshould provide a strong incentive for the capital requirement aspects of Basel III. In fact, it is\nnotable that proposals in both the U.K. and Switzerland are calling for significantly higher\ncapital requirements than in Basel III, to reduce the need for future interventions by those\ngovernments.\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, during 2008, governments around the world were forced to intervene to\nprotect the global financial system. The Dodd-Frank legislation provided significant regulatory\ntools to address the “too big to fail” problem. However, three years after the failure of Lehmann\nBrothers, there remain significant impediments to avoiding the need for government intervention\nto protect large financial intermediaries. Everyone knows that some large European financial\ninstitutions have of late encountered problems. So it is critical that we focus on strengthening the\nfinancial architecture, so that the struggles of one institution or a group of them no longer poses\nrisks to the broader global economy.\nSignificant challenges remain to be addressed if we are to have a global banking system\nwhere no bank is too big to fail given the collateral damage it would cause to economies and\ncitizens. I hope that this conference and others like it will be part of the important process of\naddressing these outstanding issues and challenges.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nI discussed my definition of financial stability, and the implications of the definition, in a talk earlier this\nyear at the Stanford Financial Forum. I noted that in my view “Financial stability reflects the ability of\nthe financial system to consistently supply the credit intermediation and payment services that are needed\nin the real economy if it is to continue on its growth path.” And “Financial instability occurs when\nproblems (or concerns about potential problems) within institutions, markets, payments systems, or the\nfinancial system in general significantly impair the supply of credit intermediation services – so as to\nsubstantially impact the expected path of real economic activity.” The talk is available at\nhttp://www.bostonfed.org/news/speeches/rosengren/2011/060311/index.htm.\n\n2\n\nThis includes the U.S., and all European countries with a bank ranked among the top 50 worldwide as of\nDecember 31, 2010.\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 8:30 A.M.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Higher Education and the Economy”\nRemarks at New England Board of Higher Education’s “New\nEngland Works” Summit on Bridging Higher Education and\nthe Workforce\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 7, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be with you today. I want to welcome all of you to the Boston\nFed and especially commend all the educators in the room for the work that you do. I benefited\nimmeasurably from my experience at Colby College as an undergraduate and at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison in graduate school. I am pleased now to have the opportunity to “give back”\nto both schools, in that I serve on an advisory committee for the economics department at\nMadison, and on Colby College’s Board of Trustees. These experiences give me a window into\nsome of the daunting challenges that you face, particularly in the current economic environment.\nToday I want to spend a few minutes discussing the nexus between what you do as\neducators and what I do as a central banker. Like a central banker should, let me first note that\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nmy comments represent my perspectives, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Returning to\nthat nexus between what you and I do, at first glance it might seem as if there is not much\ncommonality. A case in point – generally when setting monetary policy, we assume we have\nlittle impact on demographic variables including the educational attainment of the workforce.1\nNot that such variables are unimportant, by any stretch, because we all know that the educational\ncharacteristics of the workforce play an important role in the dynamics of an economy. A welleducated work force is likely to be more productive, and highly skilled workers tend to have\nmuch lower unemployment rates in economic downturns.\nOn the other hand, as senior officials at colleges and universities, you likely view\nmacroeconomic conditions as something you have little control over. You focus instead on key\nmatters like educating students, worrying about raising funds for the endowments that are a key\ningredient to financial aid, and affording new and engaging educational programs. So while you\nmight take them as “given,” the recent recession has only highlighted how economic conditions\naffect how you go about educating students.\nI would like to suggest, however, that what educators do matters to the Fed and what the\nFed does matters to educators. I’ll touch briefly on some of the reasons why.\nAs you all probably know, the monthly U.S. employment report was released last Friday.\nThe unemployment rate is now 9.0 percent – a rate that remains stubbornly, and unacceptably,\nhigh. The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions to improve the growth rate in the\neconomy. But economic “headwinds” – stemming from the previous financial crisis and\nconcerns about possible future financial shocks – have meant that despite Federal Reserve\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nactions, economic growth has been lethargic and job growth has been too slow to make\nsignificant inroads into reducing the unemployment rate.\nHowever, underlying the average unemployment statistics are a vast range of\ncircumstances, depending on educational attainment.\nToday I want to discuss some of those statistics and propose that as you and your peers\nare making admissions, financial aid, and retention-program decisions at your schools, you are\npowerfully shaping the outcomes for individuals – and society more generally. I also want to\nemphasize that institutions represented in this room play an important role in economic\ndevelopment in the communities in which you are located. There are important synergies\nbetween communities and schools of higher education. Schools are important anchors for their\ncommunities. They provide good and stable jobs for people in the area, and businesses that\nsupport the academic community benefit as well. They also bring in highly motivated students,\nsome of whom choose to use their education to form businesses in the communities where they\nwere educated. And of course the schools benefits, in many ways, from their communities.\n\nEducational Attainment and the Work Force\nIt is stating the obvious, but educational attainment is one of the defining characteristics\nof a workforce. Particularly in New England we tend to have highly skilled and highly educated\nworkers.\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI would like to take just a moment to show how educational attainment is important not\nonly to individuals, but also to the communities they inhabit. In the current economic\nenvironment, the variation in unemployment by educational attainment is particularly striking.\nTo begin, let me draw your attention to Figure 1. As a result of a long and severe\nrecession, the unemployment rate has gone up dramatically for people in all categories of\neducational attainment, but no one will be surprised to hear that the levels of unemployment are\ndramatically different depending on educational attainment. Those with no high school diploma\nare experiencing more than three times the unemployment rate of those with at least a bachelor’s\ndegree. While the current unemployment rate is 9.0 percent percent, for those with at least a\ncollege education it is only 4.4 percent.\nIt is important to note that while the level of unemployment has varied by educational\nattainment, Figure 1 is not supportive of what economists call a “structural” unemployment\nexplanation for persistently high unemployment – such as when there are lots of open jobs that\ncannot be filled because the available workers have the wrong skill sets for those positions. As\nyou may know, evidence of a change in the structural level of unemployment has been a matter\nof significant debate among economists and policymakers. Figure 1 might provide some\nevidence that structural unemployment was a problem if, for example, unemployment had risen\ndramatically for lower-skilled workers but there was a shortage of highly skilled workers (that is,\ntheir unemployment rate had fallen).\nStimulating an economy where most of the unemployment is structural would place\nadditional demand on high-skilled jobs – causing rapid increases in compensation for those\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nworkers without generating improvement in the overall unemployment rate, as the supply of\nhighly educated workers would be slow to respond.\nBut we see quite the opposite right now, because people at all levels of educational\nattainment have experienced a substantial increase in unemployment, as shown in Figure 2. In\nfact, if one compares the percentage increase in unemployment by category of educational\nattainment, it is striking what a high percentage increase in unemployment has occurred in each\ncategory. This is consistent not with the “mismatch” dynamic of structural unemployment but\nwith a story of weak demand throughout the economy.\nOn this subject I would recommend a recent paper by economists Bob Triest and Bill\nDickens, presented last month at the Boston Fed’s annual economic conference. They provide\nimportant evidence on employment flows – evidence that is consistent with most of the\nunemployment being driven by inadequate demand, rather than structural problems.2\nA look at the compensation data in Figure 3 provides additional evidence that structural\nunemployment cannot explain the persistently high unemployment rate. If most of the current\nunemployment were structural, we would expect to see compensation increasing as employers\nbid for scarce high-skilled workers. But as the figure shows, compensation growth has slowed,\nand remains quite low relative to compensation over the past 30 years.\nSimilarly, Figure 4 shows there has been no great divergence in compensation trends\nacross occupations. If a skills mismatch existed, one would expect wages in the sectors where\nsupply is short to be accelerating, while wages would be declining in sectors where there was\nexcess labor supply. We do not see this happening. Growth in compensation for management\nand professionals – presumably a higher skilled occupational category – has not shown evidence\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nof sharp acceleration relative to occupations that one would presume have somewhat lower skill\nrequirements, such as work in natural resources, construction, and maintenance.\nIn fact, Figure 5 presents the increase in labor costs over the past nine quarters (since the\nbeginning of the recovery) by occupation, and it does not show dramatically different growth in\ncompensation by job type. In fact, management and professional occupations have seen\ncompensation grow less than workers in natural resources, construction, and maintenance over\nthese nine quarters of recovery.\nThis is just some of the evidence that suggests why the notion of rising structural\nunemployment cannot explain the high aggregate unemployment rate we are unfortunately\nexperiencing. This distinction is very important to the policy response. Of course, for\nindividuals it should be noted that employment prospects are significantly improved with\neducational attainment.\nBut educational attainment affects far more than just employment prospects. The lefthand chart in Figure 6 shows the relationship between median household income and\neducational attainment. While the median income of all households is approximately $50,000,\nthere are substantial differences based on educational attainment. Those with no high school\ndiploma have less than half the median income, and those with just a high school diploma (no\ncollege experience) have about three-quarters of the median income. And those with\nprofessional degrees have more than twice the median income.\nAnd the right panel of the figure shows that growth in median income over the past two\ndecades also varies substantially by educational attainment. For example, those with only a high\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nschool education have experienced a significant decline in median real income where the most\nrapid growth has been for those that have received doctorate or master’s degrees.\nFigure 7 shows that educational attainment also translates into significant differences in\nnet worth. Those with college degrees have more than triple the net worth of those that do not.\nOver the last two decades, those with college degrees have had a significant increase in their real\nnet worth – while in contrast, those with no high school diploma have substantially less net\nworth, and their real net worth has declined over the past two decades. Of course, the causation\ncan work in both directions here, especially with regard to inherited net worth – that is, parental\nwealth makes it easier to afford higher education.\n\nThe Implications\nFigure 8 shows that the U.S. workforce is becoming more educated. There has been a\nsubstantial increase in the number of people in the workforce that have a bachelor’s degree or\nhigher. Given the employment, income, and net worth differentials shown in earlier charts, it is\nnot surprising that an increasing number of high school students are realizing that higher\neducational attainment is in their interest.\nHowever, underlying this positive trend are sharp differences across racial categories.\nFigure 9 shows that educational attainment differs substantially by race. While Asian\nindividuals have been particularly successful in obtaining college degrees, African-Americans\nand Hispanics in the labor force significantly lag in educational attainment. This lack of\neducation makes it much more difficult for them to maximize their potential, given the evolving\nwork-force needs in the US economy.\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nI think there are a number of potential implications for educational leaders from this\nanalysis. As you consider whom to admit, how much of an endowment to spend to provide\nfinancial aid, whether financial aid should be in the form of grants or loans, and how those scarce\nfunds should be allocated, I would urge you to keep in mind that you are making choices that are\nnot only important for individuals but for society more generally. And I would urge public\npolicymakers to keep similar notions in mind when they consider budgetary investments in\npublic and community institutions.\nIndeed, income and net worth differences are highly related to educational attainment, as\nI have shown. Insuring that children have adequate preparation, from early childhood education\nthrough high school, is critically important. And it is critical that those whose families have\nlimited financial means are not shut out from the opportunities an education provides. In short,\nfinding ways to encourage greater educational attainment – particularly for low and moderate\nincome families and those racial groups that have traditionally been underrepresented – will be\nan important determinant of the quality of the U.S. work force and the income distribution in our\ncountry.\nSimilarly, many of your institutions are in cities that have been hard hit by the economic\ndownturn and tepid recovery, making it even more important – to a macroeconomic policymaker\n– that you reach out to affected communities, and view your institutions as anchors of\ncommunity economic development. Certainly the location of this conference, in Boston,\nhighlights the tangible benefits that can accrue to a community when it has great colleges, and\ncollege leaders that take the development of their communities seriously.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFinally, I am pleased to note that many schools have become better at bridging their\nstudents to the working world. I would strongly encourage using alumni networks and other\nresources to provide students with internship opportunities. A vibrant New England needs a\nvibrant work force, and internships can be an important way for communities to attract and retain\ntop talent.\nHelping the region attract and retain talented college students is one reason the Boston\nFed partnered with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce to provide a better clearinghouse\nfor college internships in the Boston area. I would encourage your institutions’ career offices to\ndirect students looking for internship opportunities to the web site that has been set up.3 We and\nour partners hope it will continue to grow and provide many opportunities in the greater Boston\narea over time.\nI have described the Boston Fed’s research that highlights the important role that\neducation plays in our regional development. Let me touch briefly on other policy work that we\ndo and describe what is currently a major concern to us. At the Boston Fed it is central to our\nmission to explore ways that U.S. monetary policy – entrusted by Congress to the Federal\nReserve System – can promote maximum employment with stable prices. My own forecast is\nthat inflation is likely to be below 2 percent over the next several years, in part because of the\nvery weak labor markets. Given the very weak labor market conditions and the low expected\ninflation rate, the Federal Reserve should in my view continue to take action to aggressively try\nto reduce the stubbornly high U.S. unemployment rate.\nBut clearly the Federal Reserve cannot do it alone. Given the sobering macroeconomic\nsituation, it is important that fiscal policy, controlled by the federal government and the states, do\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Monday, November 7, 2011 at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nits part. It is also important for international policy makers to take actions that provide more\nstable world markets. But at the same time, in my view the Federal Reserve should continue to\nuse the tools at its disposal to boost demand in the economy. And at the same time, we would do\nwell to work on addressing any impediments to students getting the employment opportunities\nthat will serve them, their communities, and the macroeconomy.\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you today, and to take a few minutes to explore the nexus\nbetween higher education and the macroeconomy. Thank you for having me.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nI am aware, of course, that investment in human capital through schooling may have a degree of sensitivity to\ninterest rates.\n2\n\nSee their paper at http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/LTE2011/papers/dickens-triest.pdf.

Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n“Four Common Misconceptions\nAbout the Federal Reserve”\nRemarks at the\nBoston Economic Club\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 16, 2011\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nI would like to thank Chip Case for inviting me to address the Boston Economic Club.\nOver the years Chip has been a visiting scholar at the Boston Fed and has provided wonderful\ninsights into developments in real estate markets. As you all know, Chip is one of the country’s\nleading experts on real estate – an area that has been the focus of much attention and a lot of\ndifficulties over the last few years.\nNormally when giving a talk I try to focus on an important element of the economic\noutlook, or an important policy action the Federal Reserve has recently taken – and I use data to\nexplain the issue and its relevance.\n1\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nToday, however, I am going to take a different tack. I still want to use data – never fear –\nbut for a somewhat different reason.\nAs you know, ever since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has been lauded by\nsome for its bold actions and criticized by others. This comes with the territory of being the\nnation’s central bank. Certainly much of the criticism stems from an economy that is very\ndifficult for many citizens. And importantly, some of the criticism is deserved – and we at the\nFed truly try to learn when we do fall short.\nBut some of the criticism stems from what I’ll call some “common misconceptions” or\nassumptions about the Fed.1 Today I would like to offer a plainspoken defense to some of those\ncommon misconceptions. A defense rooted in facts and numbers, to be sure – my rhetorical\nskills may not win over Fed critics, but the facts and numbers may help them and others\nunderstand how the Fed actually operates.\nLet me acknowledge, of course, that as important and illuminating as they are, facts and\ndata do not capture the emotion and the frustration of these challenging economic times. At the\nFed we appreciate the widespread frustration stemming from the financial crisis, the recession,\nand the anemic recovery. But to go forward and tangibly improve things, we must use facts to\nguide our work, and must do a better job of sharing key facts and the data that underlie how and\nwhy the Fed takes the steps it does.\nLet me add as I always do that my comments reflect my perspectives, not necessarily\nthose of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Fed’s Board of Governors.\n\n2\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn recent years the U.S. central bank has taken unusual steps to combat a threatening\nfinancial crisis, a severe recession, and a disappointing recovery. By no means were we perfect,\nbut we acted in the public’s interest and I’m very supportive of the strong steps taken. I would\npoint out that the U.S. experience in the 1920s and 1930s, and Japan’s experience in recent\ndecades, show the even more dramatic economic pain that comes when central banks and\nnational governments act less than forcefully, or declare the crisis over too soon.\nHowever, the extraordinary steps the Fed has taken over the last four years have led to\nsome misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. Central banking and monetary policy are not\neasy to explain, but the Fed could have done a better job of it. But at the end of the day we’ve\nseen the creation of certain misconceptions, not supported by facts, about the U.S. central bank\nas an institution. The best way to address a misconception is to offer up the facts. So today I\nplan to address some of the misconceived assumptions about the Federal Reserve and our\nactions.\nIt is not surprising the Federal Reserve and other central banks have received an unusual\namount of attention of late. We are experiencing historic times, and an unusual confluence of\nevents. We experienced a global financial crisis which underlined the fact that financial markets\nand financial institutions have a significant impact on the real economy and all of its participants.\nWe have seen in dramatic fashion how increased global interconnectedness, despite its benefits,\nallows problems to quickly move across national borders. As a case in point, witness the\nreactions of our own U.S. financial markets to actions occurring, or not occurring, in Greece – a\ncountry of less than 11 million people, roughly the size of Ohio – and other countries. Add to\n\n3\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nthis the fact that, both here and abroad, fiscal problems have increasingly limited the response we\nwould normally expect in a severe economic downturn and a painfully slow recovery.\nThese events, taken together, have made forecasting the future path of the economy quite\nchallenging – and should instill humility about predicting the future, or how future shocks could\nimpact the domestic or world economy.\nIn response to the crises, the Federal Reserve has been forceful in trying to promote\ngrowth and thus reduce the unemployment rate, while achieving core inflation rates close to 2\npercent. Other central banks have too. Central banks2 have attempted to fight the crisis and\ndownturn by dramatically increasing their balance sheets (see Figure 1), buying non-traditional\nassets, and pushing short and long-term rates to new lows to try to create conditions that\nstimulate economic activity.\nUnfortunately, the creative and forceful response of many central banks to a bad\neconomic situation has not often been matched by fiscal policymakers and international officials.\nCentral banks cannot address these economic problems on their own. They can mitigate some of\nthe problems by reducing the cost of credit to individuals and businesses. And make no mistake,\nwhile the scale of the problem is great, that should not dissuade us from actions that make even\njust “a dent.” For instance, an action that reduces the unemployment rate by half a percent does\nnot bring us close to full employment, and does not solve the country’s problems, but\nnonetheless would perhaps create roughly 750,000 jobs that may not have been created in the\nabsence of the action.\n\n4\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFederal Reserve actions alone cannot solve all the problems affecting the domestic and\nworld economy. But the Fed can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of actions, and where\nactions can move us closer to better economic outcomes without substantial costs, it can and\nshould take action. In fact, that’s exactly what the Fed has been doing, and that is exactly what it\nshould be doing – consistent with the dual mandate given to us by Congress, to do what we can\nto achieve maximum sustainable employment consistent with stable prices.\nWith that introduction, allow me now to discuss four common misconceptions about the\nFed. To give you an overview, the four assumptions or misconceptions are as follows:\n•\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\n\n•\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\n\n•\n\n“Printing money” has caused serious inflation\n\n•\n\nRates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the\neconomy\n\nThere are of course a number of other issues we could discuss, but I think these are\nimportant and involve plenty for us to cover today.\n\nCommon Misconception 1:\nThe Federal Reserve is not audited and its actions occur without oversight\nIn recent years there have been those advocating that the Federal Reserve should be\naudited. They are right in that the Fed should be audited – but they are mistaken in believing that\nthe Fed is not. In truth the Fed is a heavily audited organization subject to substantial oversight.\n\n5\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nThis is entirely appropriate given the sensitivity of what central banks do, and the need to do it\nwithout reproach.\nIn truth,\n•\n\nall twelve Federal Reserve Banks employ professional internal auditors;\n\n•\n\nan outside audit firm, Deloitte & Touche, audits our financial statements;\n\n•\n\nthe Federal Reserve’s Inspector General, created by Congress, audits our activities;\n\n•\n\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office audits our actions, and\n\n•\n\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve System, provides significant oversight\nregarding Fed actions, as demonstrated by frequent requests to testify before\ncommittees – and by legislation over the years that has altered our role.3\n\nBut as one who loves data and facts, let me say a bit more to be quite specific on this\nmatter.\nWe produce an annual report that includes audited financial statements and a letter from\nme as CEO attesting to effective internal controls, based on the work of our internal audit and\nrisk-management teams. We include a letter from Deloitte & Touche attesting that we have\nmaintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are also audited by the Office of Inspector General, created by Congress to provide\nindependent oversight over the Federal Reserve – with the power to do investigations,\ninspections, audits, and reports. The Inspector General reports to Congress semi-annually – the\nmost recent report covers activities through March and is available on the web.4\n\n6\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn Figure 2, I list some of the reports by the Inspector General over the past year, all of\nwhich are available on the Board’s web site. As you can see, the reports cover a wide range of\ntopics.\nWe are also audited by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which\nconducts audits, investigations, inspections, and reports on behalf of Congress. These reports are\npublicly available on the GAO web site. Figure 3 shows some of the GAO reports done in the\npast year regarding a wide variety of Federal Reserve activities. As with the Inspector General\nreports, one GAO report covers the operations of the Fed’s emergency liquidity facilities,\nincluding the one run at the Boston Fed on behalf of the System.5\nAnd we have direct oversight by Congress, which requests testimony on a wide range of\ntopics. Figure 4 lists some of the recent Congressional testimony provided by the Fed’s\nGovernors, all of which are available on the Board website. For the sake of brevity this figure\ndoes not include the testimony of staff other than Governors. Naturally, Congressional hearings\ninclude extensive questioning concerning our actions and policies.\nWe are an entity created by Congress. Congress can and does change our roles and\nresponsibilities over time. A good example is the Dodd-Frank legislation which increased our\nresponsibilities in some areas (like savings and loan holding company supervision) and curtailed\nour role in others (such as lending in “emergency and exigent” circumstances).\nSo in sum we are a heavily audited and supervised organization.\n\n7\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nHowever, I suspect that some who argue for more audits of the Federal Reserve may\nactually be advocating for the politicization of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve was\ndesigned by Congress to be a non-partisan organization that conducts monetary policy in the\npublic interest free of political influence. Good monetary policy in the public’s long-run interest\ncan involve unpopular decisions in the short run – such as the Volcker-era effort to rein in\ninflation using very high interest rates. Central banks in developed countries have become\nindependent of legislative bodies and the chief executive precisely because monetary policy has\nbeen shown to result in better economic outcomes (e.g., growth, and price stability) when it is\nnot influenced by partisan politics.\nI strongly believe that officials in the Federal Reserve conduct policy without regard to\npartisan politics, and to the best of their abilities try to administer monetary policy in the national\ninterest. This is a hallmark of our organization and should not change.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not audited and its\nactions occur without oversight. The fact is that the Fed is widely audited, and is subject to\nrobust oversight – which is as it should be.6\n\nCommon Misconception 2:\nThe Federal Reserve is not a transparent organization\nWhen I first joined the Federal Reserve 25 years ago, the lack of transparency was a very\nvalid criticism of the Fed and most other central banks. However, the fact is that much has\nchanged in the last 25 years – and particularly in recent years.\n\n8\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nLet me admit that in the midst of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 one could fairly\nsay that we did not spend sufficient time explaining to the public the unique and extraordinary\nactions being taken. All I can say is that in the midst of the crisis there was a focus on solutions,\nand given the severity of the situation, this resulted in our spending less time communicating\nwell about what we were doing and why. Though no excuse, reacting to a crisis in real time\neffectively requires something else “give” – and we were frankly so preoccupied with\nextinguishing the fire we did not explain as well as we should have what we were doing and\nwhy. At the Fed we have tried since to explain precisely what we did and why, but we are still\nsome distance from being understood, or fully trusted for that matter.\nI think the Fed has learned from this. I would argue that at this point our organization has\nshifted a great deal compared to two years ago, and at this point we are quite transparent and\ngetting better at it in time.\nWhen I started at the Fed there was no explicit mention of our federal funds target after\nFederal Open Market Committee meetings, no minutes of the meetings, and no transcript\nreleased with a five-year lag. The minutes we provide now are quite detailed, providing a\nsummary of staff presentations, discussion of the views of all participants regarding the outlook\nfor the economy, and discussion of the debate around the policy recommendation.\nIn addition, we have started providing economic projections after each scheduled two-day\nmeeting – currently four times a year. This provides a summary of the forecasts by the twelve\nReserve Bank presidents and the Governors (currently there are five); on variables related to\ninflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of GDP. We provide both the range of forecasts\n\n9\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nand the central tendency of the forecasts. And the Fed is continuing to review its\ncommunications practices to ensure accountability and increase public understanding.\nAlso, after the four two-day FOMC meetings the Chairman now conducts a press\nconference. He fully describes recent policy decisions and the forecasts of the participants in the\nFOMC meeting, and answers questions posed by members of the press.\nAnd the Federal Reserve has also been communicating more directly with the public.\nThe Chairman has participated in a variety of what for central bankers are less traditional\nopportunities, from “60 Minutes” to various town hall style meetings, including one last week\nwith soldiers and their families on base in Texas.\nThe role of the Reserve Bank presidents has also evolved. Figure 5 lists the speeches I\nhave given this year that like today’s include a published text, charts, and an invitation to\nmembers of the media. The text and slides of this speech are available to anyone on our public\nweb site. When we can, we make video summaries available as well. We “tweet” some of the\nmain points.7 And at the end of the speech I will be answering whatever questions you would\nlike to raise.\nI also give a variety of informal talks that generally provide condensed versions of some\nof my previous public speeches. In addition, I have from time to time had interviews with\nmembers of the media working in print, radio, and TV. And I am not alone in this respect. My\npeers have similarly been trying to communicate more about actions we are taking on a range of\nissues, from monetary policy to supervisory policy to financial stability. We do not always agree\non policy matters and this in itself is an indicator of transparency.\n10\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nAlso, there are some areas in which the Federal Reserve is now being more transparent –\nin part with the encouragement of Congress. The emergency facility loans we made during the\ncrisis are listed on our web site, and information on “Discount Window” loans to banks are\nprovided with a lag.\nThe reason for this lag is straightforward – not secret for secrecy’s sake. As a lender of\nlast resort concerned about financial stability and the continuation of lending during times of\nfinancial turbulence, you want institutions that are in generally sound financial condition to turn\nto the central bank when there is a temporary shortage of liquidity in the banking system – in\nother words when they have liquidity but not solvency problems. In the parlance of monetary\npolicymaking, this prevents interest rates from rising significantly during a financial disruption.8\nHowever, immediate disclosure might cause financial institutions to view loans from the\nFed as stigmatized, possibly raising concerns with depositors and investors, and further\ncontributing to liquidity problems. The Dodd-Frank legislation wrestled with this issue and\ncame up with what I view as a reasonable solution – disclosure of Discount Window loans after\ntwo years.\nSo I fully acknowledge that the Federal Reserve has not always been very transparent –\nbut feel very comfortable attesting that there has been a rather dramatic change over the last two\ndecades, and in particular over the last few years. While we at the Fed continue to examine ways\nto better explain and describe monetary policy and other aspects of central banking, I would\nsuggest that there are now regular opportunities to hear from Federal Reserve officials directly or\n\n11\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nvia the press, and I am glad that Fed officials are now much more publicly discussing policy\nactions.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that the Federal Reserve is not a transparent\norganization. The fact is that we are quite an open central bank – much better than we used to be\n– and are improving in this area even as we speak.\n\nCommon Misconception 3:\n“Printing money” has caused serious inflation\nFigure 6 highlights that both bank reserves and the total assets of the Federal Reserve\nhave grown substantially during the crisis, recession, and anemic recovery – with the most rapid\nexpansion occurring in the fall of 2008. The asset expansion is broken out in more detail in\nFigure 7. In the wake of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the freezing up of short-term credit\nmarkets, the Federal Reserve established a variety of emergency liquidity facilities. Something\nthat is frequently overlooked is that over time all the loans were paid back with interest and the\nfacilities have been closed. The size of the Fed’s balance sheet has still continued to grow, as a\nresult of our large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities – policy actions\nwe took given the weak economy and our primary policy rate hitting the lower bound of near\nzero.\nHowever, while the most rapid growth in reserves occurred three years ago, Figure 8\nshows that over the three-year period ending last quarter the U.S. has experienced the lowest\naverage inflation rate of any such period over the past thirty years. Over the past three years,\ntotal personal consumption expenditures (PCE9) inflation has averaged only 1.2 percent.\n\n12\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nFigure 9 shows that in only two of the five most recent three-year periods has total PCE\ninflation been above 2 percent – and these two periods were ones where food and energy shocks\noccurred.\nWe have indeed expanded our balance sheet – some call that “printing money” – but it is\na misconception that it has resulted in significant inflation.\nThe reason why this is so is shown in Figure 10, which depicts loan growth at\ncommercial banks over the same three-year periods. Anemic loan growth in the credit crunch\nera of the early 1990s is one outlier on the chart, and the negative growth in the most recent\nthree-year period is another. In the recent period banks have become more risk averse, and have\nfocused (appropriately) on rebuilding their capital – while many borrowers have had their\nborrowing capacity weakened by the difficult business conditions of a severe recession and slow\nrecovery. The end result is curtailed lending. Bank reserves are not going to be inflationary\nwhen bank lending is not expanding.10\nLet me be quick to stress that inflation would be serious and detrimental at higher levels.\nI am not suggesting otherwise. I am just pointing out some facts that suggest it is currently very\nrestrained.\nIndeed, other market indicators show little evidence of concern over inflation. The 10year U.S. Treasury bond has fallen to around 2 percent, as shown in Figure 11. Similarly, other\ncountries where the central banks have expanded their balance sheets to fight the anemic\neconomic conditions also have very low 10-year government bond rates. Evidently investors\n\n13\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nare not expecting large increases in inflation, or they would demand much higher rates to\npurchase long-term securities.\nAs everyone knows, high unemployment goes hand in hand with wages and salaries\ngrowing very slowly, at least for most jobs. Given the current conditions in the job market, there\nis little upward pressure on wages and salaries – and this means that there is little reason to\nexpect significant inflationary pressures as higher labor costs push up higher end prices. I would\nadd that while measures of money such as M211 have grown rapidly of late, much of that growth\nreflects investor risk aversion – investors moved funds to bank accounts during the debt ceiling\ndiscussion in August and in light of the European problems that have emerged more recently.\nFinally, I would note that one country where the central bank expanded its balance sheet\nsignificantly, some time ago, is Japan. The Japanese central bank began expanding its balance\nsheet more than a decade ago but rather than experiencing rapid inflation, they have been\nconcerned with deflation, as shown in Figure 12. Deflation – which is not my forecast at this\npoint, let me say – can be extremely difficult to overcome, as consumers expect products will be\ncheaper in the future, wages and salaries decline, and debtors face high real interest rates.\nMake no mistake, the Federal Reserve will need to remove its current policy\naccommodation as the economy improves. The current level of bank reserves would not be\nappropriate if we were at full employment – such accommodation would indeed be inflationary\nin that situation. However, that is not the situation the country is in now, and I fully expect we\nwill remove accommodation appropriately as the economy improves.\n\n14\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nIn sum, the common misconception is that “printing money” has caused serious inflation.\nThe fact is that inflation has remained extremely restrained during this period of accommodative\nmonetary policy necessitated by economic conditions.\n\nCommon Misconception 4:\nRates are already low so further monetary policy actions will have no impact on the\neconomy\nThe empirical evidence shows that Fed purchases of Treasury and MBS securities did\ncause market interest rates to fall. While rates can be impacted by a variety of factors – for\nexample if the economy were to show signs of rapid growth you would expect rates to rise – 10year rates now are much lower than they were before we undertook our actions.\nIt is unlikely that lower rates would have no impact on the economy. Such an assumption\nwould be quite a leap of faith, because in general further lowering rates would:\n\n•\n\nimpact home purchases – because lower rates can have a big impact on cash flow of\nconsumers;\n\n•\n\nimpact consumer durables like cars – because auto-loan rates are one of the largest\npayments many people make each month;\n\n•\n\nimpact investment – because lower rates improve the potential benefit (the net present\nvalue) of investment projects;\n\n•\n\nimpact exchange rates and foreign trade – as suggested by the complaints heard from\nsome trading partners when the Fed has previously lowered rates;\n\n15\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n•\n\nimpact inflation expectations, which impact real interest rates – given the evidence\nthat one-year inflation expectations did rise when the Fed announced its purchase\nprogram last year.\n\nResearchers at the Boston Fed have conducted statistical tests to determine if the reaction\nto long-term interest rates is different after the crisis, and whether there is empirical evidence that\nlower interest rates would indeed have no impact. Research by my colleague Giovanni Olivei\nhas found that prior to the crisis our statistical model of the economy would imply that a\nsustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would lead to a cumulative\nincrease in real GDP over two years of approximately 2.5 percent.\nWith the reduction in interest sensitivity in housing more recently, the model would\nimply that a sustained decline in the 10-year Treasury rate of 100 basis points would now lead to\na cumulative increase in real GDP over two years of approximately 2 percent – as shown in\nFigure 13.12 Concerns with falling prices, high unemployment, and limited access to credit have\nlikely all contributed to this lower – but clearly non-zero – response to lower rates in housing\nmarkets.13 The assertion that our rate actions simply will have no impact is not supported by our\nstatistical work.\nIn sum, the common misconception is that rates are already low so further monetary\npolicy actions will have no impact on the economy. In fact, statistical analysis suggests the\nopposite.\n\n16\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\nConcluding Observations\nWe continue to experience unusual turbulence in financial markets. We had significant\nfinancial shocks that impacted the real economy during the crisis and recession, and we remain at\nrisk that financial shocks here or abroad could still impact our economy.\nThe Federal Reserve, like other central banks, has taken strong action to mitigate the\nimpact and avoid worse outcomes for the economy. As stated at the outset of my talk, the Fed’s\nactions have mitigated problems but we alone cannot quickly restore full employment. That will\ntake time and appropriate actions by international policymakers, U.S. fiscal policymakers, and\nmonetary policymakers.\nThank you for indulging me today as I discussed some common misconceptions about\nthe Federal Reserve. In sum, I believe the facts show that the Fed remains an organization with\nsignificant oversight, which has substantially increased its transparency, and continues to pursue\nactions consistent with our Congressional mandate to work to the best of our ability to achieve\nmaximum employment consistent with stable prices, in the national interest.\nThank you, and I would be happy to take a few questions now.\n\nNOTES:\n1\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary’s primary definition of a misconception is “An incorrect interpretation or\nunderstanding.” I am also thinking of assumptions, which the same dictionary defines as “a statement accepted or\nsupposed true without proof or demonstration.”\n\n17\n\n\f* EMBARGOED UNTIL Wednesday, November 16, 2011 at 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time OR UPON DELIVERY *\n\n2\n\nEven those with only an inflation mandate – unlike the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate involving\ngrowth and employment as well as inflation.\n3\n\nSuch as the Dodd-Frank Act that in many ways altered the actions the Fed could take in a crisis\n\n4\n\nSee http://www.federalreserve.gov/oig/default.htm\n\n5\n\nThat report used our internal audit reports and the Inspector General report, and we provided substantial additional\ninformation to the GAO.\n6\n\nFor more on this topic see the Board’s notes on audits and oversight at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm\n\n7\n\nYou can follow the Boston Fed on Twitter at \"@BostonFed\"\n\n8\n\nYou can learn more about the Discount Window in the FAQs section of www.discountwindow.org – specifically\nhttp://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/dwfaqs.cfm?hdrID=14&dtlID=75\n9\n\nFor an understanding of PCE and other inflation measures see the Public Policy Brief “Inflation Targeting –\nCentral Bank Practice Overseas” by Jane Sneddon Little and Teresa Foy Romano\n(http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppb/2008/ppb081.pdf) which states “The PCE measures the goods and\nservices purchased by individuals and nonprofit institutions. In contrast, the CPI measures the out-of-pocket\nexpenditures of urban households, a smaller set of items than the set covered by the PCE. The two indices also differ\nin the basket of items included in the PCE is chain-weighted – that is, it changes from quarter to quarter – while the\ncomposition of the CPI basket remains fixed.”\n10\n\nWhat we call the money multiplier – whereby reserves generate lending (bank assets) which generates deposits\n(bank liabilities) that are counted as money – has been severed by the decline in lending.\n\n11\n\nFor a definition of M2 see the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress\n(http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20110713_mprfullreport.pdf) July 13, 2011 – page 37\n(footnote 13).\n\n12\n\nForthcoming in a research brief entitled \"The Sensitivity of Demand to Interest Rate Changes: Has It Changed\nRecently?\" by Vice President and economist Giovanni Olivei.\n\n13\n\nTests on other components of the forecast cannot reject that the coefficients we use to model the economy have\nnot changed.\n\n18\n\n\fFour Common Misconceptions\nAbout the Federal Reserve\nEric S.
