Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at a Forum on the Federal Reserve’s Inflation\nTarget – the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy,\nthe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 8, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at Brookings. I’d like to thank David Wessel\nof the Hutchins Center for inviting me to participate in this forum. It is also my pleasure to be\nhere with John David Murray of the Bank of Canada, to provide some observations in response\nto his comments. 1\nAt the outset, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThe monetary policy framework adopted by the Federal Reserve is rooted squarely in our\n“dual mandate” from Congress, which directs the Fed to seek maximum sustainable employment\nand stable prices. 2 And in the spirit of today’s conference, I want to pose a couple of questions\nthat tee up my remarks. Given that the Congressional mandate has not changed, why might it be\nbeneficial to evaluate the Fed’s monetary policy framework periodically? And relatedly, why is\nthe framework not as durable as the Congressional mandate?\nImportantly, the Congressional mandate is quite broad. It was not until 2012 that the\nFederal Reserve explicitly defined the stable-prices component of the mandate in numerical\nterms, as a 2 percent inflation target tied to total PCE inflation. 3 The second half of the mandate,\nmaximum employment, was not assigned a numerical target given that the Fed does not, of\ncourse, set the natural rate of unemployment – and estimates of the natural rate have changed\nconsiderably over time, with changes in demographic and labor-market characteristics.\nSince 2012, the FOMC has voted at the beginning of each year on a statement of longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, which provides a long-run goal for inflation (the 2\npercent target) and broadly defines a monetary policy strategy. Currently, the strategy involves a\nso-called balanced approach: the Committee gives equal weight to deviations of employment\nfrom an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from the 2 percent target.\nIn light of this, one could argue that the U.S. version of the Bank of Canada’s five-year\nreview actually occurs at a yearly frequency at the Federal Reserve. However, the Federal\nReserve’s annual reaffirmation of the longer-run inflation goal and monetary policy strategy has\nnot regularly involved the extensive discussion, and incorporation of outside comments, that are\npart of the Bank of Canada’s process.\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFrom my perspective, it is possible that the absence of more involved debate regarding\nthe Federal Reserve’s inflation goal and monetary policy strategy reflects the fact that the FOMC\nis broadly comfortable with the status quo framework for achieving monetary policy goals and\nour mandate. Still, with this in mind, I would suggest that there are several compelling\narguments for a more robust periodic review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy\nframework.\nFirst, admittedly the choice of the 2 percent inflation target reflected a commonly used\ntarget of other central banks, and was consistent with a literature that viewed a 2 percent target as\nlikely to be in the neighborhood of optimal. However, much of that literature was based on precrisis research that estimated that the effective lower bound for the policy interest rate would\nrarely be hit, and that interest rates would remain at the effective lower bound only briefly. That\nresearch appears to have significantly underestimated the real-world probability of hitting the\neffective lower bound. Moreover, the probability of hitting the effective lower bound is higher\nin an economy with a low equilibrium real interest rate, as would be associated with our current\ncharacteristics of slow productivity growth, slow population growth, and aging demographics.\nIn fact, the optimal rate of inflation may move around just as does the natural rate of\nunemployment.\nSecond, the ability to achieve an inflation target over a reasonable amount of time has\ncome into question as the U.S., Euro Area, and Japan have all fallen short of their inflation\ntargets, regularly and quite consistently, since the onset of the financial crisis. Notably,\nundershooting on inflation has occurred despite aggressive use of less-traditional monetary tools\ndesigned to make policy more accommodative in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Great\nRecession, and very slow recovery. 4\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThird, U.S. policymakers must take into account complicating factors. . With fiscal\npolicy constrained by rising debt-to-GDP ratios, and questions about the potency of\nnontraditional monetary policy tools in generating robust recoveries, the trade-offs between the\ngoals – and even the optimal level of the goals – may be different now than when the FOMC\nadopted the framework.\nIn light of all this, in my view it may be a good time to consider putting in place a\nperiodic Federal Reserve led assessment of the U.S. monetary policy framework that would\ninclude input from a variety of sources inside and outside the central bank. Such a periodic reevaluation could consider whether changed economic fundamentals (such as the equilibrium real\ninterest rate) should alter how best to satisfy the Congressional mandate given to the central\nbank.\nFurthermore, a periodic reassessment could involve consideration of whether alternative\nframeworks would better meet the mandate, and evaluate the costs and benefits of transitioning\nto the new framework – as well as the longer-run implications. For example, in recognition of\nthe challenges the Federal Reserve has experienced with our current framework, a reassessment\nmight include discussion of whether an inflation range, nominal GDP targeting, or price-level\ntargeting would help the Fed better achieve its Congressionally-mandated goals. In fact, my\nown view is that we should be focused on an inflation range, with the potential to move within\nthe range as the optimal inflation rate changes. This will be the topic of a talk I am giving later\nthis week, when I will have an opportunity discuss the suggestion more fully.\nSimilar to the Bank of Canada, a U.S. review could include research papers by Fed\neconomists, as well as input from academics and other macro-policy institutions. This type of\nperiodic exercise could reinforce the Federal Reserve’s commitment to attaining the\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nCongressional mandates, while providing a more public and transparent forum for evaluating our\nperformance in attaining these goals.\nFinally, I would note that a number of process details could influence the efficacy of such\na review process. The Bank of Canada has a full review every five years. One does not want to\nevaluate a monetary policy framework too frequently, given that changes in underlying\neconomic fundamentals are relatively infrequent and take time to fully assess. At the same time,\nit is important to make changes if the existing framework is no longer consist with how the\neconomy has evolved.\nIt would also be extremely important to design a review process that appropriately\nbalances the central bank’s accountability to Congress for the mandate with its independence to\npursue policymaking and technical refinements. Reviews would need to focus on the structural\nchanges that have reduced the efficacy of the Fed’s monetary policy framework, not the injection\nof short-term partisan political influence. While any significant change in the framework should\ninvolve active consultation with Congress – as was the case when the Fed formally adopted its\nnumerical price objective in 2012 – the review should be focused on the technical framework\nthat the central bank employs to achieve the Congressional mandate’s goals and would need to\nbe seen as such.\nMy own personal preference would be to conduct a full review with a specified frequency\n– possibly longer than the five years used by the Bank of Canada – but to make it possible to call\nfor an earlier review when warranted. Given the unpredictability of changes in the optimal\ntargets, providing the option to call for a special review would be important. This would allow\nfor a re-examination when needed – specifically when most participants view economic events\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nas justifying a full re-examination of the framework. Clearly, however, this is just one approach\nand there are a variety of other permutations that could be considered by the FOMC.\nIn summary and conclusion, the Bank of Canada provides a process which I view as quite\ninstructive. My own view is that the costs of hitting the effective lower bound, and staying there\nfor a prolonged period, should cause a reassessment of whether a specific 2 percent inflation\ntarget is still warranted. The optimal inflation rate is unlikely to be 2 percent if economic\nfundamentals cause the central bank’s policy rate to regularly hit the effective lower bound\nduring economic downturns. As a result, having a process that can fully and more transparently\nexamine the monetary policy framework would be a process improvement, and would allow the\nFederal Reserve to systematically examine and alter its framework when needed.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAs John Murray illustrated in his presentation, the Bank of Canada has a process for revisiting its inflation target\nand monetary policy framework that has been in place for quite some time. This process occurs at a regular five-year\nfrequency, it seeks comments from academics and the general public and, though not legislated, it features the\nexplicit involvement of the government. See http://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/.\n\n2\n\nThe dual mandate is derived from The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. Among the changes made to the\nFederal Reserve Act was a directive to \"maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals\nof maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The shorthand for this is the goal of\nmaximum employment consistent with stable prices.\n\n3\n\nIn order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued\nthe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public\nwhat monetary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting\npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed.\nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy\nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation\ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer-run values.\nThe statement became effective January 24, 2012, and was subsequently amended, effective January 31, 2017. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-fomc.htm.\n4\n\nAs already mentioned, the statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy specifies a balanced\napproach on stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and the unemployment rate around its natural level. It\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:25 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, January 8, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncould be useful to periodically assess the extent to which such an approach is followed in practice, and the reasons\nthat may lead to deviations from such a strategy.\n\n8\n\n\f",

I also feel very fortunate and\nhonored to have received the GIC’s Frederick Heldring Award for Global Leadership from my\ngood friend David Kotok, who has previously led, and long been associated with, the Global\nInterdependence Center’s conferences. I thank the GIC for this award, which of course honors a\nremarkable individual, Fredrick Heldring, whose life story1 is inspiring. He was courageous in\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthe Dutch Underground in World War II, successful as a banking leader, a passionate advocate\nfor investment in inner cities, and committed to many civic and philanthropic causes.\nBefore I begin my remarks today, let me note as I always do that the views I express are\nmy own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nI would like to start by reflecting on the past year’s economic performance, which was\nbetter than most forecasters were expecting a year ago. U.S. labor markets have continued to\nimprove; and with the unemployment rate now at 4.1 percent, I think we have clearly left the\nperiod of the Great Recession behind. Real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2017\nwas over 3 percent – well above the level of growth economists call “potential.” By definition, if\nabove-potential growth continues, as expected by many forecasters, labor markets will tighten\nfurther, likely pushing the unemployment rate well below its sustainable rate.\nInflation has also been subdued, especially considering that it has already been a fairly\nlong economic recovery by historical standards. Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve\nto pursue a very gradual exit from the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation undertaken\nto address the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the slow recovery. The Fed’s policy\naccommodation, along with a well-recovered economy, have been generally good for asset\nprices, including stocks.\nWhile the economic news has remained positive, the extent of the forecast “misses” by\nFOMC participants and private sector forecasters – our forecast errors for both inflation and\nunemployment – are relevant for the topic of this conference on money and models. On a\nquarterly basis, FOMC participants provide their economic forecasts for key economic variables,\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ncalled the Summary of Economic Projections or SEP. At the December 2016 FOMC meeting,\nthe median SEP forecast was that 2017 would finish with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent\nand core inflation (measured using the Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE price index)\nat a rate of 1.8 percent. Instead, the unemployment rate ended up 0.4 percent lower than\nexpected; and core PCE inflation, based on the data through November, was 0.3 percent lower\nthan expected. While these are not overwhelming forecast errors by historical standards, the\ninflation miss, in particular, has received significant attention by some observers – as inflation\nhas been lower than expected, despite labor markets that are tighter than expected.\nMy own perspective on this is that the recent misses in the Fed’s inflation forecast have\nnot been particularly large, taken in the context of the forecast errors made historically in\nforecasting inflation. The forecast errors for inflation also have not been particularly consistent\nor persistent, which would be expected if the Fed’s inflation models were missing some\nfundamental change in the inflation process. As a result, I would argue that it does not seem\njustified to assume there have been changes in the underlying inflation process, based on\nrelatively modest recent misses. Of course, if we continue to experience one-sided forecast\nerrors for another year or two, the possibility of structural change should be considered more\nseriously.\nThus, I do not view the somewhat lower than expected recent inflation rate as particularly\ntroublesome for near-term monetary policy. But looking to the medium and long run, I do see\nlow and fixed inflation targets as a potential problem – particularly if we continue to experience\nlow productivity growth, a low equilibrium interest rate, and the near-certainty of a slowly\ngrowing and aging workforce. In such an environment, with a two percent inflation goal,\nnominal interest rates are likely to be low, on average. As a consequence, when a recession\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\neventually does occur, policymakers would likely start with a low policy rate – perhaps 3 percent\nor so – leaving little room to lower rates to offset the effects of the recession. The desire to\nretain an adequate “policy buffer” – by which I mean the amount of room we have to lower rates\nto offset recessions – lies at the heart of my evolving thoughts on the appropriate monetary\npolicy framework.2\nIf, as a result, we seek to avoid a prolonged low interest rate environment in the future,\nthen my view is that policymakers should start studying and discussing alternative frameworks to\nmake this outcome less likely. While there is little that monetary policy can do to impact\nproductivity or labor force growth, policymakers can influence the prevailing level of interest\nrates by adjusting our medium-term inflation goal.3 One option would be targeting a higher\ninflation rate,4 so that nominal interest rates would be higher than otherwise – and there have\nbeen other more technical proposals (for example price-level targeting and nominal GDP\ntargeting) designed to provide a greater buffer.5\nI would also suggest that the optimal inflation rate is not likely to remain constant over\ntime. An alternative, which would recognize that the inflation target should not necessarily be\nconstant, is an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target. Within this framework, one\ncould think of our inflation goal as defined by two components: A range of inflation rates that\npolicymakers would find acceptable across many economic circumstances, and a medium-term\ngoal within that range that policymakers would set, perhaps year by year, depending on specific\neconomic circumstances.\nIn my view, adopting an inflation range that allows for movement in the effective\nmedium-run inflation goal might be a helpful addition to the Fed’s monetary policy framework.6\nAn inflation range that allows some movement in the inflation target, depending on economic\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfundamentals, would be treating the Fed’s inflation goal more like the natural rate of\nunemployment, where we recognize that the natural rate will shift over time with demographic\nand other workforce characteristics.\nOf course, the advantages of greater inflation target flexibility would likely be partly\noffset by some costs. For instance, it is likely that such flexibility would generate more\nuncertainty about inflation in the medium to long run, since we cannot know for sure how long\nproductivity and demographic trends would persist.7 However, if we set the range to – for\nexample – 1.5 to 3.0 percent, and were successful in keeping inflation mostly in that range, this\nwould represent a set of inflation outcomes that are similar to those the U.S. has experienced\nover the past 20 years.\n\nPerspectives on Recent Forecast Misses\nAs previously mentioned, once a quarter, FOMC participants provide their economic\nforecasts for key economic variables. Among the charts that are included are the so called “fan\ncharts,” shown in Figure 1 for PCE inflation. The fan chart shows that even at a 70 percent\nconfidence level, the forecast errors for PCE inflation are quite large. Thus, with the current 2\npercent forecast, it would not be at all surprising to have actual inflation turn out to somewhere\nbetween 1 to 3 percent.\nThe sources of these forecast misses are many: large, unexpected changes in energy,\nfood, import or other volatile prices can temporarily disrupt overall inflation measures relative\nto the forecast; the economy can grow faster or slower than we expect; or our assessment of what\nis relatively fast or slow can be off. A good example of an unexpected price change is the\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmodification in wireless service pricing by many U.S. mobile carriers that occurred last spring.\nThis change is one of the factors that lowered the PCE inflation rate relative to the forecast in\nDecember 2016.\nFigure 2 provides some history on SEP8 and private-sector forecast errors, comparing the\nmedian core PCE inflation rate forecast for one-year-ahead to the actual rate, based on both the\nSEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ fourth quarter forecasts for each year.9 While\nthe forecast error (based on the 2016 fourth-quarter forecast for the core inflation rate10 for the\nfourth quarter of 2017) was clearly a miss, it certainly was not outsized relative to other oneyear-ahead forecast errors made over the past 10 years. In addition, forecasters made both\npositive and negative forecast errors during this period, not persistently missing in one direction.\nThis forecast record seems inconsistent with concerns of some observers who argue forecasters\nare missing some fundamental attribute of inflation dynamics.\nFigure 3 provides forecast errors for the unemployment rate forecast, by comparing both\nthe SEP and the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ median unemployment rate forecast for the\nfourth quarter of the next year with the actual rate, for each fourth-quarter forecast. While the\n2016 fourth-quarter forecast error for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 is not\nparticularly large relative to previous years, there do seem to be persistent, consistent forecast\nerrors in the same direction for the unemployment rate, unlike for the inflation rate. That is,\nsince 2010, forecasters have regularly anticipated the unemployment rate would fall less than\nactually occurred.\nFrom a short-run policy perspective, the inflation forecast errors do not seem to be\nparticularly noteworthy, and would not seem to indicate serious forecast biases over the past\ndecade. In contrast, the persistent forecasts that unemployment will not fall as much as has\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\noccurred should provide policymakers pause, since at 4.1 percent the unemployment rate is\nalready well below most estimates of the sustainable long-run unemployment rate. The most\nrecent median estimate for the natural rate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is 4.5\npercent; the corresponding median longer-run unemployment rate estimate from the December\nSEP is 4.6 percent.\n\nModels and the Monetary Policy Framework\nSince January 2012, the FOMC has published a statement of longer-run goals and\nmonetary policy strategy11 that it reaffirms, sometimes with small modifications, at each January\nFOMC meeting. The statement provides the FOMC’s tactical approach for meeting the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate provided by Congress: fostering economic conditions to achieve both\nstable prices and maximum sustainable employment.\nThe statement explicitly defines the inflation goal as being a 2 percent inflation target.12\nThe employment mandate does not have a numerical target because the natural rate of\nunemployment is primarily determined by non-monetary factors, must be inferred from other\neconomic data, and has moved significantly over time.13 The statement also clarifies that when\nthere are misses in both elements of the dual mandate, the Committee should follow a balanced\napproach, by which we mean that we will give equal policy attention to deviations of\nemployment from an estimate of full employment, and to deviations of inflation from its 2\npercent target.\nAt the time of adoption of the statement on longer-run goals, the 2 percent inflation target\nwas quite similar to the target set by most other central banks in developed economies.14 Many\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nacademic studies advocated for a 2 percent inflation target as being consistent with price\nstability, although many of them were conducted prior to the Great Recession. Most of this\nresearch that attempted to determine how large a policy buffer would be sufficient – and thus\nhow high a target inflation rate would be best – generally estimated that interest rates were\nunlikely to reach the effective lower bound, but if they did, the expected duration at near-zero\ninterest rates would be measured in quarters, not years.\nUnfortunately, the economic history of the past 10 years has shown that many developed\ncountries in the wake of the Great Recession and financial crisis were forced to hold interest\nrates near zero for many years, much longer than the earlier model estimates suggested.15 Such\nlow interest rate environments make it difficult to conduct counter-cyclical monetary policy, and\ncan potentially undermine financial stability, as households and firms “reach for yield” in the\nface of low interest rates, almost always taking on additional risk as a consequence.\nIt is not surprising, in my view, that many estimates assumed that a period of prolonged\nlow interest rates was unlikely. In an economy with rapid increases in productivity and an\nexpanding labor force, periods of prolonged low interest rates are likely to be avoided in most\nrecessions. However, the size of the negative shock from the Great Recession, along with\nfundamental changes in the economy,16 have made it much more likely that future recessions\ncould also result in prolonged low interest rates and a need to conduct monetary policy with\nnontraditional methods, such as asset purchases on central banks’ balance sheets – rather than\njust through movement of short-term interest rates.\nFigure 4 shows FOMC participants’ assessments of the longer-run rate that the federal\nfunds rate will settle to when the Fed has achieved both elements of the dual mandate.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRecognizing the effects of slower productivity growth and labor force growth on this so-called\n“neutral” rate of interest, SEP submissions have gradually lowered this measure since 2012.\nIn early 2012, both the median forecast and the central tendency of FOMC participants\nwas that the federal funds target rate in the longer-run would be at least 4 percent. As of\nDecember 2017, both the median forecast and most of the central tendency expect that the\nfederal funds target rate will be below 3 percent.17 Since most recessions involve lowering the\nfederal funds target rate by more than 300 basis points, this makes it seem quite likely that a low\ninterest rate environment will become a more common occurrence.\nFigure 5 illustrates one possible reason for the decline in the expectations of the longerrun or neutral federal funds rate. Productivity growth is much lower now than it has been for\nmuch of the previous 50 years. This lower productivity growth, as long as it persists, implies\nthat real interest rates are likely to be lower on average.\nFigure 6 provides another reason to expect lower real interest rates, which is the\nreduction in the growth in the civilian labor force. With slower population growth, fewer\nimmigrants, and an aging population, the growth in the labor force is expected to be much lower\nfor quite some time than it has been in previous decades. Again, this implies lower real interest\nrates.\nOne way to avoid periods of prolonged low interest rates would be to alter the inflation\ntarget in response to changes in our estimates of real interest rates – estimates that have been\nchanging of late. This would make inflation, like the natural unemployment rate, a target that\ncould vary over time. If, for example, the monetary policy framework set an inflation range of,\nsay 1.5 to 3.0 percent, the FOMC could vary its medium-term inflation target to be high, low, or\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nin the middle of the range depending on economic factors that the Committee could determine at\nthe beginning of each year. For example, in the current environment, with low population\ngrowth and low productivity growth, policy could move even more gradually to remove\naccommodation, and allow inflation to be somewhat higher in its range. Should the labor force\nor productivity grow more quickly, the Committee could seek to gradually reduce the inflation\ntarget within its range.\nUsing an inflation range would trade off the costs of more effective policy responses to\nrecessions (and the potential financial stability risk that may attend prolonged low interest rate\nperiods), with the costs of having somewhat less certainty about what the inflation rate would be\nin the long run. But as long as the inflation rate were in a relatively narrow band, such as 1.5 to\n3.0 percent, the range would not be a dramatic change from actual experience and would\ntherefore be less likely to impact inflation expectations. If changes in productivity and labor\nforce growth occurred very infrequently, the inflation target would be stable – but at a level more\nconsistent with avoiding prolonged low interest rates.\n\nConcluding Observations\nRecent forecast errors of inflation and unemployment have not been particularly large,\nand do not pose much challenge to continuing on the current path of gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate. Perhaps the bigger risk for short-run policy is the fact that the unemployment\nrate continues to fall further below sustainable levels, and will likely continue to do so going\nforward, risking the sustainability of the recovery.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nA more significant longer-run matter, from my perspective, is the opportunity for the\nFederal Reserve’s current monetary policy framework to adapt to the recent experience with\nprolonged low real interest rates. If the U.S. economy is to avoid a scenario in which the\neffective lower bound is reached and the central bank must use its balance sheet for asset\npurchases rather than move short-term interest rates for counter-cyclical monetary policy, then\npolicymakers should consider alternative monetary policy frameworks that would make such\noutcomes less likely.\nAn inflation range with an adjustable medium-run inflation goal is one way to address\nsuch concerns, but there are a variety of alternative frameworks also worth considering.18 In my\nview, we are approaching a time when a comprehensive reconsideration of the monetary policy\nframework is likely warranted, given the experience of the past 10 years. Any change we make\nshould be designed to provide policymakers with the flexibility to set monetary policy\nappropriately as key features of the economy change, as they have repeatedly over U.S.\neconomic history.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nSee https://www.interdependence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HeldringObituary.pdfhttps://www.interdependence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Heldring-Obituary.pdf.\n2\n\nFor additional discussion, see Jan. 8, 2018 remarks at the Brookings Institution by Eric S. Rosengren, Reviewing\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2018/reviewing-monetarypolicy-frameworks.aspx\n3\n\nOn average, overall or nominal interest rates equal the prevailing real rate of interest plus the average inflation rate\n– which should be near our inflation goal – we can move the overall average level of nominal rates one-for-one by\nchanging our inflation goal.\n\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n4\n\nWhen the real interest rate is low.\n\nFor more discussion behind the Fed’s current monetary policy framework and alternative monetary policy\nframeworks see, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/01/04/the-hutchins-center-explains-the-frameworkfor-monetary-policy/.\n5\n\n6\n\nAdditional dimensions of such a framework would be how symmetric the range would be: Is flexibility to be used\nonly when real rates are low, requiring a higher inflation goal? Or would we expect to adjust the medium-term\ninflation goal down when real rates are unusually high? And what status does the center of the range hold? Do we\nintend for inflation to average somewhere near the center of the range over a longer span of time?, Do we always\nplan for inflation to return to the center of the range at some horizon?\n7\n\nIn addition, FOMC participants would no doubt consider adjusting our medium-term inflation goal up or down\nonly when we (and others) had estimated that a persistent change in real rate determinants had occurred and was\nlikely to continue. Such an assessment is of course difficult and entails uncertainty\n8\n\nPrior to the June 2015 medians, SEP medians are only available with a five-year lag. Proxies for the medians for\nthe December 2013 and 2014 one-year-ahead forecasts for the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2015, for core PCE\ninflation and the unemployment rate used in the forecast error calculations for Figures 2 and 3 are calculated from\nthe distribution of FOMC participants’ projections reported in ranges of tenths in the FOMC meeting minutes.\n9\n\nOf course, the actual values are revised over time. We have used the most up-to-date figures in the calculations.\n\n10\n\nWhile total PCE is the target for this exercise, we used core PCE to avoid outsized errors that would be related to\nthe often volatile food and energy prices.\n11\n\nIn order to provide more clarity about how the Federal Reserve implemented the dual mandate, the FOMC issued\nthe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is important for clarifying to the public\nwhat monetary policy is about, and also for providing FOMC members with a common framework when conducting\npolicy. FOMC members will have different opinions about economic conditions and where the economy is headed.\nStill, according to the strategy document, the way these differences are translated into different policy\nrecommendations should be consistent across FOMC members, in that members agree to share the same inflation\ngoal and assign the same penalty to deviations of inflation and unemployment from their longer-run values. The\nstatement became effective Jan. 24, 2012, and was subsequently amended, effective Jan.31, 2017. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy-fomc.htm.\n12\n\nThis is measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n\n13\n\nFor example, the natural rate has varied as the demographic composition of the labor market has changed.\n\n14\n\nTwo percent was seen as a practical compromise between some academic work that suggested that zero (or even\nnegative) inflation was optimal, and work on the other hand that saw value both in “greasing the wheels” of wage\nsetting given reluctance of workers to take nominal wage cuts, and in providing the policy buffer that I have just\ndiscussed that comes with a positive inflation rate.\n15\n\nOnce the central bank gets stuck at near-zero rates, additional counter-cyclical monetary policy can only be\nprovided through alternative monetary policy measures such as quantitative easing, which aims to directly influence\nlonger-term interest rates and other asset prices.\n16\n\nFor example, declining productivity growth and slowing labor force growth.\n\n17\n\nAs of December 2017, the SEP median longer-run federal funds rate was 2.75 percent and the central tendency\nwas 2.75 to 3.00 percent. Looking at the individual observations from the SEP “dot plot” shows that the majority of\nthe central tendency expects a rate of 2.75 percent.\n\n13\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, and 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time on Friday, January 12, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n18\n\nSome have suggested simply raising the inflation goal, which would of course provide more of the policy cushion\nI have discussed today. Others have proposed using price-level targeting or some variant of it, which is a way of\npromising future inflation when the economy is weak, thus (in theory) adding stimulus by lowering real interest\nrates. This policy also has the advantage of making the price level – the cost of living – more predictable. And some\nhave suggested following a nominal GDP target. The virtue of this framework is that it is flexible with respect to the\nmix of overall nominal growth that comes from real growth versus inflation. When real growth is slow, inflation is\nallowed to rise higher, similar to the flexible target range approach I have outlined.\n\n14\n\n\f",

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSpringfield Regional Chamber Outlook 2018\nSpringfield, Massachusetts\nMarch 9, 2018\n\nIt is great to be back in Springfield, one of the winners of the Boston Fed’s Working\nCities Challenge 1 competition. Springfield’s winning proposal focuses on providing better\nworkforce development opportunities for lower-income individuals to obtain meaningful\nemployment. Achieving the goals that Springfield has set for itself is, of course, much easier in a\nrobust economy, and the economic outlook I will share today is consistent with an economy that\nwill require even more workers in the labor force.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nOver the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen and is now below even the lowest\nestimates made by Federal Reserve policymakers (FOMC participants) for the level that is likely\nto be sustainable in the longer run. As labor markets have tightened, we have seen a gradual\nincrease in wages and salaries. While inflation 2 is still a bit below the FOMC’s target, most\nforecasters expect inflation to rise to, or near, the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2018.\nDespite this good news, the stock and bond markets have become much more volatile in\nrecent weeks. This likely reflects, in part, the realization that financial markets need to factor in\nthe risk that wages and prices could grow too quickly, if there were too much fiscal and\nmonetary stimulus – particularly with the economy currently at or beyond full employment and\ninflation approaching the Fed’s goal. I view the underlying insight as a healthy realization by\nmarket participants that the risks are two-sided: Unsustainably strong growth that leads to\nexcessive inflation or financial imbalances is now as much a risk as growth that falls short. And\nthere is a realization that monetary policymakers need to be vigilant in calibrating the level of\naccommodation, if continued sustainable growth is to be achieved.\nTo be more specific, as inflation approaches the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and\nunemployment remains below what we see as a sustainable rate, it is appropriate for the Fed to\ncontinue to remove monetary accommodation by gradually raising interest rates. At the\nDecember FOMC meeting, the median of Fed policymakers’ estimates of “appropriate monetary\npolicy” called for 75 basis points of additional rate increases over the course of 2018. My own\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nview, at that time, was actually that somewhat further removal of accommodation might well be\nneeded in 2018. That assessment remained dependent on the tenor of incoming data, of course.\nAnd since the December FOMC meeting, we have all observed a mix of news: fiscal\nspending, a large tax cut, and continued strengthening of economies around the world provide\nsupport to U.S. growth. But, on average, household and business spending data have come in a\nbit weaker than expected, leading many to revise down their forecasts for the current quarter.\nEven so, most forecasters currently expect growth this year to exceed its sustainable pace, which\nimplies further tightening of labor markets and more wage and price pressures over time. Thus,\non balance, developments since December generally reinforce my view of the need for somewhat\nmore removal of accommodation than was reflected in the December median Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP). Of course, following through on this expectation is conditional on\nthe economy unfolding about as expected, and that unexpected events such as a trade war or a\nsubstantial change in the geopolitical situation do not surprise on the downside.\n\nRecent Developments in the Economic Outlook\nImprovements in the economy over the past year have, in large part, been driven by\nstrong consumer spending. This is not unusual for the U.S. economy, of course, since consumer\nspending accounts for roughly two-thirds of real GDP. As Figure 1 highlights, consumption\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was quite strong, at 3.8 percent.\nHowever, as the figure also shows, forecasts for the first quarter of 2018 are for much\nslower consumption growth. This forecast, from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, preceded\nthe relatively weak retail sales reported for January. If retail sales continue to disappoint,\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconsumption for the first quarter of this year may well be below that projected by forecasters in\nearly February.\nWhat is the likelihood that we will continue to get weak readings on consumer spending?\nThat is difficult to say, but my view is that the data we have seen so far most likely reflect a\ntemporary pause in this quarter, following unexpectedly strong growth in the fourth quarter of\n2017 – and as a consequence, we will probably continue to see solid consumption growth over\nthe balance of this year.\nMy optimism in this regard is driven by the relatively strong fundamentals that support\nconsumption growth. Figure 2 shows that household wealth has been rising, and is well above\nthe level from the beginning of 2016. This gain reflects continued increases in housing wealth\ndue to rising house prices in many areas of the country, as well as steady gains in the stock\nmarket. While there have been some sizable stock market declines in recent days, Figure 3\nshows that current stock prices remain at roughly the levels they achieved in December 2017.\nOutside of stock market levels, there has been a notable increase in volatility. One\nmeasure of stock volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index\n(VIX), had been unusually low in 2017. This very low market volatility can lead investors to\ntake on more risk, and in a period of still relatively low interest rates, to “reach for yield” – that\nis, buy riskier assets than one would otherwise, in order to achieve a desired profit or savings\ngoal. Clearly, as can be seen in Figure 4, stock market volatility has increased significantly in\nrecent weeks. From a financial stability standpoint, I view the increased volatility as an\nimportant reminder to market participants that stock prices can be quite sensitive to economic\ndata. 3\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nFigure 5 illustrates that despite an increase in market volatility, consumers’ confidence in\nthe strength of the economy remains high, well above index levels for 2017. While there has\nbeen some weakness in the higher-frequency consumer data, I view high consumer confidence as\nconsistent with the fundamental underpinnings of consumer spending that I discussed a moment\nago, and suggestive that what we are seeing now will turn out to be a pause by consumers after a\nvery strong fourth quarter.\nFigure 6 shows that the Blue Chip forecasters seem to share my optimism. For much of\n2017, the forecasters had expected U.S. real GDP for 2018 to result in growth of 2.4 percent.\nHowever, with the significant reduction in taxes and the increases in government spending, as\nwell as the continued improvement in the national economies of trading partners, the consensus\nforecast now anticipates real GDP growth to be 2.8 percent for the year. Such a rapid increase is\nlikely to be primarily driven by the fiscal stimulus. It remains to be seen, however, what signal\nBlue Chip forecasters may take from the more recently released weaker consumption data.\n\nOutlook for Inflation\nSome observers of Federal Reserve policy have been concerned about the low inflation\nreadings for much of 2017. I have viewed those soft data as likely to be transitory, reflecting\nsharp temporary changes in relative prices – such as modifications in wireless service pricing by\nU.S. mobile carriers last spring. Recent data have given me more confidence in that assessment.\nFigure 7 shows the Blue Chip consensus forecast for inflation as measured by the\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) for 2018. The Blue Chip survey focuses on the CPI, which tends to\nrun approximately 20 to 30 basis points higher than the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nindex, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. The figure shows that in the first\nquarter of 2017, forecasters expected that 2018 CPI would be running at 2.3 percent, consistent\nwith the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target using the PCE measure of inflation. However, in the\nspring of 2017, with some large relative price changes, forecasters began to lower their\nexpectations for 2018 inflation – reaching estimates as low as 1.9 percent by late summer. More\nrecently, their forecasts for 2018 CPI inflation are back where they were in early 2017.\nFigure 8 illustrates how the data have changed more recently, by averaging the PCE\ninflation data over one year, over six months, and over three months. The year-over-year change\nin the PCE index remains somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, as some of the\nsoft data from last spring have lowered this 12-month change. However, more recent readings\nthat exclude those spring observations (that is, the six month data and the three month changes)\nshow a rate of inflation above our 2 percent target.\nOne final factor that may have temporarily elevated the index is oil prices. Figure 9\nprovides a similar chart for the inflation measure that excludes the volatile food and energy\nprices, the so-called core PCE inflation rate. More recent readings for core inflation suggest that\nwe have been right at our 2 percent target for the past three and six months.\n\nLabor Market Developments\nAnother factor that gives me some confidence that the Fed will continue to hit the\ninflation target is the strength of the labor market. Figure 10 shows that the number of\nindividuals filing initial claims for unemployment insurance is at low levels not seen since the\nlate 1960s and early 1970s, when the labor force was considerably smaller than it is today. This\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlikely reflects a number of positive factors, including: strong demand for workers that derives\nfrom a strong pace of sales for goods and services; employers’ reluctance to lose employees,\ngiven the difficulty they would face in hiring replacement workers; and the fact that potential\nemployees who lose or switch jobs are able to find new employment without suffering a spell of\nunemployment.\nAnother way to assess labor market tightness is to look at labor flows – in other words,\nhow workers move between being employed, unemployed (not working, but looking for work),\nand out of the labor force (neither employed, nor looking for work). 4 Figure 11 shows the flow\nfrom being employed to unemployed. Official data for gross worker flows begin in the early\n1990s, and consistent with the data on initial claims, the employment-to-unemployment flow is\nnear a recent low.\nFigure 12 shows the flow from being out of the labor force to being unemployed. This is\nnear the early 2001 series low, reflecting that when workers decide to enter or reenter the\nworkforce, they find employment opportunities quickly.\nFigure 13 shows the flow from being out of the workforce into employment. This series\nis at a recent high, reflecting that in a tight labor market more potential workers are being drawn\ninto the workforce. While this is a particularly good sign for hard-to-employ workers, it also\nhighlights a potential future problem: the supply of workers outside of the labor force and willing\nto reenter the labor market will become a constraint over time. 5\nAs we experience the welcome development of more workers entering employment from\noutside of the workforce, there will be an increasing need for training and other aspects of\n\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nworkforce development. As I mentioned at the outset of the talk, that is one of the areas that the\nSpringfield team has chosen to focus on for their Working Cities Challenge initiative. 6\nOf course, with labor markets tight, some employers will attempt to attract new\nemployees by offering higher wages and benefits, raising the average compensation paid to many\nemployees over time. Figure 14 shows the employment cost index measure of wages and\nsalaries for private industry workers, excluding incentive-paid occupations. This wage measure,\nalong with a number of others, has been gradually trending upward over the past several years.\nAs the labor market continues to tighten – which would be consistent with the 2.8 percent Blue\nChip forecast for 2018 real GDP growth – one would expect to see continued upward pressure on\nwages and salaries.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would say that the economic data have been quite good,\nmonetary policy remains accommodative, and fiscal policy has just become quite a bit more\nstimulative. While a tight labor market provides definite advantages – such as employment\nopportunities for workers who have struggled to find a job – nonetheless, providing too much\nstimulus from either monetary or fiscal policy at this stage of the economic cycle could threaten\nto create a so-called “boom and bust” economy, which policymakers certainly want to avoid.\nTo keep the economy on a sustainable path, I expect that it will be appropriate to remove\nmonetary policy accommodation at a regular but gradual pace – and perhaps a bit faster than the\nthree, one-quarter point increases envisioned for this year in the assessment of appropriate policy\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:40 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 9, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nfrom the December 2017 FOMC meeting. This expectation assumes, of course, the data continue\nto come in more-or-less consistent with my outlook.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nThe Working Cities Challenge is an initiative of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, designed to lead smaller\ncities through a rigorous process that builds cross-sector collaboration to solve issues impacting the lives of these\ncities’ lower-income residents. Grounded in Boston Fed research, the Challenge encourages leaders from the public,\nprivate, and nonprofit sectors to advance proposals that tackle complex challenges facing smaller post-industrial\ncities and achieve large scale impact across communities. Included in the initiative is a grant competition designed\nto accelerate promising work already underway. For more information, see:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities.\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve measures inflation by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, or PCE.\n3\n\nIn some ways, increased volatility may help to enhance financial stability if it moves market participants to more\nappropriately assess the risks in their investments.\n4\n\nThe stock of unemployed workers, as well as the net job creation in any month, are the net result of a huge number\nof such flows among employment, unemployment, and those not in the labor force.\n\n5\n\nBecause many of those not in the labor force are pursuing education, retired, disabled, or attending to family care,\nthere is a limit to the number of workers not currently in the labor force who can plausibly meet the demand for new\nworkers. At some point, the available supply of workers will become a constraint on our ability to grow, although I\ndo not believe that we are there just yet.\n\n6\n\nFor more information on the Springfield Working Cities Challenge effort, see:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round2/cities/springfield.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nTenth Conference of the International Research Forum on\nMonetary Policy\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nGood evening. I would like to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak\nat this, the tenth conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy. I would\nlike to commend all of today’s presenters for their research contributions, and I am looking\nforward to Saturday’s sessions.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI particularly appreciate the chance to focus today on monetary policy and financial\nstability. Much of my own research has focused on the ways that problems in the financial\nsystem can ripple through to the real economy. Certainly the last financial crisis – and the\nensuing Great Recession and very slow recovery – underlined the role that financial instability\ncan play in disrupting the economy and in slowing its recovery. These episodes also helped\npolicymakers sharpen their thinking about the need for policy tools that can be deployed to\nattempt to prevent financial instability, as well as minimize the effects of instability when it does\nemerge.\nFinancial stability policy is generally associated with regulatory and supervisory\nmeasures, so the exercise of financial stability policy is often seen as being independent from the\nstance of monetary and fiscal policy. However, I am going to suggest that policymakers should\nview financial stability tools more holistically. Indeed, I would like to suggest that the ability to\nappropriately set financial stability tools is integrally related to the ability to fully utilize fiscal,\nmonetary, and financial stability policy tools to respond to a large adverse financial shock.\nFigure 1 provides a chart that shows how often from 1987 to 2008 the FOMC\nparticipants used words associated with financial stability concerns. The analysis of FOMC\nmeeting transcripts is taken from a paper I wrote with Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\neconomists Geoff Tootell and Joe Peek.1 While there are mentions of financial instability terms\nduring the times when markets are doing unusually well, the largest spikes in the series are\nassociated with the occurrences of adverse financial shocks – particularly when they are\naccompanied by an economic downturn.\nTools intended to enhance the resilience of the financial system, such as increased capital\nand liquidity requirements, are important – and in my view, should be emphasized more\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nthroughout an economic cycle. But the analysis we did suggests that the focus on financial\nstability concerns is most intense when the adverse consequences are apparent.\nCrisis prevention is an important matter for further discussion, and one on which I\nbelieve we have made progress through implementing key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act – but prevention is not really the focus of my remarks this\nevening. Tonight, I would like to focus on the tools that are available to policymakers once a\nsignificant adverse financial shock occurs (that is, crisis response).\nIf an adverse financial shock occurs, fiscal, monetary, and financial tools can all play a\nrole in offsetting the economic fallout that often results – even though maintaining financial\nstability is not the primary goal of monetary or fiscal policy. But if monetary and fiscal policy\nhave limited capacity to respond to such shocks – because public debt is already high, or because\ninterest rates are already low, for example – then this should figure into policymakers’ thinking\nabout how and when to use financial stability tools.\nTo be a bit more specific, I have in mind using a broad set of tools to respond to any large\nadverse financial shock that could have a broad impact on the economy. On the fiscal side,\nwhich of course the Fed does not control, that would likely include cutting taxes and increasing\ngovernment spending. Monetary policy tools would include conventional tactics (reducing\ninterest rates) and less conventional ones (like expanding the central bank’s balance sheet\nthrough asset purchases). Finally, I would note how important it is that financial stability tools\nprovide sufficient buffers.\nThe use of financial stability tools is generally seen as being conditioned on and\ncalibrated to the severity of likely economic stresses – but I would argue that it is also critically\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nimportant to take into account the extent to which monetary and fiscal policy are equipped to\nrespond to an adverse financial shock, so that policymakers can best coordinate the response to a\ncrisis across all available tools. Much of what I have in mind has to do with assessing each\npolicy tool’s capacity to respond.\nFor example, suppose that a country’s government-debt-to-GDP ratio is high, limiting the\nability or willingness to use fiscal tools to offset financial and other shocks. If that country has\nalso not developed sufficient financial stability response tools, then most of the countercyclical\npolicy response will likely fall to monetary policy. Alternatively, if the government-debt-toGDP ratio is extremely high and interest rates are already at or near the effective lower bound,\nand the country is unable or unwilling to use less-conventional monetary tools like quantitative\neasing, then financial stability tools are likely to be more important. In sum, it is important to\nconsider whether there is sufficient capacity in the toolkit for policymakers to adequately (let\nalone optimally) respond to severe financial shocks.\nTurning to current conditions in the United States, our economy is now experiencing a\nvery low unemployment rate – in fact, a rate below the level many would associate with full\nemployment. In part due to relatively tight labor markets, we are beginning to see modest\nincreases in wage and price inflation, and a more rapid increase in asset prices. Most economists\nexpect continued solid growth and strong labor markets, so this may be the time to focus on\nwhether we have adequate buffers among the available policy tools – to be prepared, should\nanything disrupt the recent trajectory.\nUnfortunately, I would argue that rather than building sufficient capacity for possible\ndownturns – which, by the way, I am not expecting or predicting – the U.S. has actually seen a\nreduction in the capacity of these so-called “buffers” across the policy tools. If fiscal and\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmonetary policy tools are likely to be limited in the event of a large adverse shock, I would\nsuggest that policymakers need to think about and act on creating greater capacity and flexibility\nwithin the tools currently available – including those most directly related to financial stability.\n\nMonetary Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nFigure 2 shows the federal funds rate, covering the same period – 1987 to 2008 – as the\nearlier chart depicting mentions of financial instability terms by FOMC participants, and\nindicating the same episodes of financial disruption.2 One can see that when a significant\nfinancial stability shock occurs, the Fed usually lowers the funds rate out of concern that the\nshock might precipitate slow growth or a recession. During the 2008 financial crisis, the federal\nfunds rate was reduced to zero and the central bank’s balance sheet was expanded. In prior\nepisodes, the funds rate was high enough that the Fed had plenty of room to reduce it – that is,\nplenty of cushion. When the monetary policy cushion is substantial, the need for very large\nfiscal or financial stability buffers may be correspondingly reduced.\nSimple math suggests that the ability of conventional monetary policy to respond to a\ncrisis is currently somewhat constrained, given low prevailing rates. Figure 3 shows FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts of the federal funds rate likely to prevail in the longer run from the\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP). As real interest rates have been depressed by slow\nproductivity and by demographic changes, FOMC participants’ estimates of the federal funds\nrate in the longer run have declined; the median is currently 2.9 percent.\nSuch a low “neutral” or long-run federal funds rate suggests a monetary policy cushion\n(again, the leeway to lower the funds rate) that is small by historical standards. As is shown in\nFigure 4, in most recessions the Fed lowers the nominal federal funds rate by much more than 3\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npercentage points. So in an economy like ours with low equilibrium interest rates, there is a\nstrong likelihood that in a hypothetical future recession, policymakers will run out of room to\nlower the federal funds rate, and we will hit the effective lower bound.\nWhile my own view is that unconventional policy can be a very important tool to provide\nstimulus once the effective lower bound is reached, it is fair to acknowledge that policymakers\nknow far less about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy than they do about\nconventional, short-term interest rate policy. Perhaps even more constraining is the political\nunpopularity in many countries of central bank balance sheet actions. All this means that such\npolicies could be avoided by policymakers, or even constrained by lawmakers, in the future.3\nAs I suggested earlier, if the monetary policy cushion available to offset financial shocks\nis smaller, policymakers should consider how the full array of policy tools might be used to\naddress such shocks. Sticking with monetary policy for a moment, one approach could be to\nchange the monetary policy operating procedures to make it less likely that the effective lower\nbound is hit in the future, perhaps by using an inflation range with an adjustable inflation target,\nas I have discussed in a recent talk.4 If this monetary policy approach is not feasible,\npolicymakers may wish to consider whether Countercyclical Capital Buffers should be increased,\nor other financial stability tools employed, to provide greater buffers to adverse shocks.\n\nFiscal Policy Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nFigure 5 shows the U.S. federal government surplus or deficit, measured as a percentage\nof GDP. Fiscal policy has tended not to respond to financial stability shocks unless they are\naccompanied by a recession. Fiscal policy responses include “automatic stabilizers,” such as\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nunemployment benefits, which rise automatically as newly-unemployed workers file for benefits\nduring significant economic downturns. While fiscal policy tools normally are not deployed for\nfinancial stability shocks, we can surmise that, were an accompanying recession to be large\nenough, a possible inability or unwillingness of fiscal policymakers to offset financial stability\nshocks with expansionary policy could exacerbate the problem.\nFurthermore, we should recognize that fiscal limitations can impact the choices that\npolicymakers have to utilize potential financial stability tools. In response to the financial crisis,\nthe U.S. was much more willing than Europe or Japan to provide direct capital infusions into the\nfinancial system, which arguably limited the severity of credit crunches and promoted a quicker\nrecovery in the financial sector in the U.S., relative to Europe.\nThere was sufficient fiscal capacity during the financial crisis to expand the deficit and\nengage in fiscal actions that promoted a faster recovery, but naturally such actions require a\nfiscal buffer that makes it possible to finance the effort. Figure 6 shows the general government\ngross debt as a percentage of GDP for the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S. fiscal\nresponse to the financial crisis placed the government-debt-to-GDP ratio much closer to that of\nEuropean countries. What’s more, the Congressional Budget Office’s current projections, done\nbefore the recent tax changes and increases in the federal budget, indicate that were a financial\ncrisis to occur in the near-term, the U.S. would potentially have less fiscal capacity to respond as\naggressively as it did during the last financial crisis.\nThe U.S. fiscal situation is noteworthy because of the experience of some European\ncountries during the last recession. In particular, those European countries with severe banking\nproblems were mostly southern European countries, and they experienced serious fiscal\nproblems in addition to serious banking problems. Those countries in Europe with less severe\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nbanking problems but substantial fiscal capacity did not want to use their fiscal capacity to\nresolve banking problems in other European countries. As a result, the banking problems could\nnot be easily resolved with capital infusions from governments, resulting in banking problems\ndragging out and many European banks tightening credit availability in the middle of an\neconomic downturn, in order to improve their capital-to-assets ratios. Thus the fiscal capacity\nproblems caused difficulties in resolving financial stability problems, making both worse.\nIn sum, running large fiscal deficits can potentially have ramifications for the ability to\nrespond to possible future financial stability shocks. If fiscal policy responses to financial\nstability crises are likely to be more constrained in the presence of larger government-debt-toGDP ratios, it seems prudent to consider bolstering the tools available to monetary policy and\nfinancial stability policy.\n\nFinancial Stability Response to Large Adverse Financial Shocks\nIn many countries, a variety of financial stability tools are available,5 but this is not the\ncase in the United States. The two primary financial stability tools available to the Federal\nReserve to respond to financial shocks are, first, altering the scenarios used in the bank stress\ntests that are applied to the largest banks, and second, the setting of the Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer.\nThe stress test is primarily a microprudential tool, designed to ensure sufficient capital for\nbanks in the event of a large financial shock, and is dependent on the risk characteristics of the\nindividual institution.6 By “stressing” particular assets, the test alters the cost of capital for that\nasset class, with the overall impact on any financial institution depending on its exposure to the\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nasset class and its sensitivity to changes in cost of capital. Thus, the stress test does not alter the\namount of post-stress capital relative to the bank’s reported capital for all firms in the same way.\nFirms’ post-stress capital may decrease (or increase) relative to reported capital by varying\nmagnitudes, depending on the mix of assets and hence the mix of risks.\nThe Countercyclical Capital Buffer, on the other hand, is intended to be a\nmacroprudential tool. The buffer increases capital for all financial firms it applies to during\nperiods of financial excess, but is intended to release capital during stressful periods.7 Because it\nis not related to particular stress scenarios, it does not alter the cost of capital for specific assets\nand does not impact institutions differentially depending on exposure to specific assets.8\nMoreover, it is intended to be lowered during stressful times in order to release capital for\nstronger banks, so that binding capital constraints are not addressed by reducing credit\navailability to firms and households.\nFigure 7 provides the peak unemployment rate included in the severely adverse scenario\nsince the stress tests began in the U.S. in 2009, the current level of the unemployment rate at the\ntime of the development of each scenario, and the difference between the two. The stress test\nhas quite high unemployment rates in its scenarios, even during periods when the actual\nunemployment rate is already high. As the actual unemployment rate has fallen, the change from\nthe current rate to the scenario peak has increased. As a result, the stress test as currently utilized\nmay not effectively release capital in a crisis. It is certainly possible that the stress tests could\nencourage banks to reduce credit availability to shrink assets to satisfy binding capital\nconstraints. As always, we have to examine the possibility of unintended consequences and\nassess whether it may work at cross purposes to other tools designed to speed the recovery from\na negative financial shock. While this reflects its focus on ensuring the solvency of individual\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ninstitutions relative to particular stress scenarios, it highlights why other tools may be better\ndesigned to release capital to avoid reductions in credit availability.\nIn contrast, a financial stability tool that is designed to be countercyclical is the aptly\nnamed Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Once an adverse financial stability shock occurs, the\nbuffer would be reduced, releasing bank capital so the institution does not need to shrink its\nlending – and thus reduce credit availability to firms and consumers – by shrinking assets to\nsatisfy a binding capital constraint.\nOf course, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer has to be raised in times of financial excess\nif it is to build capital that can be used when adverse shocks do occur. Figure 8 shows that many\ncountries have indeed raised their Countercyclical Capital Buffer. In the U.S., the\nCountercyclical Capital Buffer remains at zero.9\nEven if one were to ignore the opportunity to strengthen financial stability tools, in my\nview an argument can be made for increasing the Countercyclical Capital Buffer. Figure 9\nshows that commercial real estate valuations are quite stretched, as indicated by capitalization\nrates reaching series lows, particularly for apartment buildings (recall that the “cap” rate is the\nratio of net operating income to the price paid for the property at the time of a transaction – a\nshorthand for the income yield that the property is expected to provide). While low cap rates are\nto be expected in a low-interest rate environment, Figure 10 shows that the ratio has been\nimportantly driven by price increases, particularly for apartment buildings.\nTurning to equities, Figure 11 shows that by historical standards current S&P 500\ncomposite price-to-earnings ratios are at the high end of what we have observed since 1968.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nThis is even clearer if we use the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio shown in\nFigure 12.\nWith asset valuations high, a non-zero Countercyclical Capital Buffer can in my view be\njustified. However, the case is even stronger in the U.S. if one considers that should a shock\noccur, monetary policy and fiscal policy may not be expected to respond as forcefully as they did\n– appropriately so, I would add – in the last financial crisis and its aftermath.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, I would argue that now is the time to assess and strengthen\nthe various policy tools available to respond to adverse financial shocks – and yet, the tools have\nactually been diminishing. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy buffer has essentially been\ndepleted as the nominal equilibrium interest rate in the United States has fallen. This makes it\nmore likely that the effective lower bound will be hit in the U.S. if we experience an adverse\nfinancial stability shock (or any other adverse shock) at some point in the future. Since monetary\npolicy can do little to prevent the demographic or productivity changes that lead to lower\nprevailing rates, I believe that policymakers should consider adjusting the monetary policy\nframework, to address the possibility that the capacity of conventional policy tools may be too\nquickly depleted.10\nFiscal policy buffers are being bolstered in some European countries as their economies\nimprove. However, we must acknowledge that the same cannot be said for the United States.\nThe government-debt-to-GDP ratio is high by historical standards in many countries, but we see\nthat it is rising in the U.S. My view is that U.S. fiscal policy we have seen since the crisis\n12\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 7:00 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday, March 23, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nemerged in 2008 will simply give future policymakers less flexibility to respond to a\nhypothetical large financial stability shock with fiscal policy tools.\nSome countries have been using macroprudential tools to increase their policy buffers.\nWhile capital ratios in the U.S. are much improved, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which\nwas designed to be released in response to a large adverse financial shock, is currently set at\nzero.\nMany countries are not well equipped to address an adverse financial stability shock. In\nthe United States, one can see that monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential buffers are modest, and\nin many cases are being drawn down further. In my view, now should be the time that\npolicymakers carefully consider this state of affairs, and assess which tools could provide more\npotent buffers to draw upon should a large adverse financial shock occur. While that is, again,\nnot my expectation or prediction, my view is that it is an opportune time to prepare for such a\npossibility.\nThank you.\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell.

Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n“The U.S. Economy: An Optimistic Outlook,\nBut With Some Important Risks”\nEric S. Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce\nEconomic Outlook Breakfast 2018\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 13, 2018\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be back with the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce\n\nto share my economic outlook.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note as I always do that the views I express are my\nown, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee).\nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the monthly employment report.\nWhile only 103,000 new jobs were created in March, the first quarter as a whole held quite\nstrong job growth. Over the first three months of 2018, the U.S. economy added an average of\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n202,000 jobs per month – which, over the longer run, is roughly twice as many as would be\nrequired to keep the unemployment rate stable at current levels of employment, given the growth\nin the labor force.\nThis strong first-quarter job growth occurred even though the labor market is already\ntight, as indicated by an unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, a rate that most economists consider\nto be below the sustainable rate of unemployment. Consistent with tight labor markets, wages\nhave been rising, albeit gradually – average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the past year,\nabout three-quarters of a percentage point faster growth than in 2013 and 2014.\nThe tight national labor market is also reflected in New England. When I talk to\nemployers around the Federal Reserve’s First District, which includes the six New England\nstates, I increasingly hear of the difficulty in attracting employees – and more and more business\nleaders mention the additional tactics their organizations must use to attract the talent necessary\nto move their businesses forward.\nThe relative strength of the first-quarter employment growth is consistent with the strong\neconomic forecast provided by monetary policymakers after the Federal Reserve’s FOMC\nmeeting in March. The median forecast of Fed policymakers was for the economy to grow\nsomewhat faster in 2018 than earlier in the recovery – specifically, 2.7 percent in 2018 (versus\n2.2 percent on average since the recovery began in the second quarter of 2009).1\nWith this growth projected to be fairly strong, the unemployment rate is expected to fall\nbelow 4 percent, with inflation rising close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target by the end\nof 2018. These forecasts, it should be noted, also incorporate the assumption of two additional\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n25-basis-point rate increases in the short-term interest rate during the balance of 2018, beyond\nthe one that occurred at the FOMC’s March meeting.\nMy own views are that labor markets may tighten more than the median SEP forecast\nsuggests, and that inflation is likely to increase a bit more than the current median forecast by\nFOMC participants. Therefore, I expect somewhat more tightening may end up being needed\nthan is currently reflected in the projected median for the federal funds rate.\nOf course, I am talking here about forecasts, not outcomes. Economic forecasts often\nprove imperfect, with actual results varying from the forecast in part because economists need to\nmake assumptions about variables that are quite hard to predict. Simply put, many important\neconomic decisions are not straightforward. For example, what will happen with tariffs around\nthe world over the course of this year? Will the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) significantly alter its production of oil? And how will foreign economies’\nmonetary policy change? Many of these questions require the forecasting of political outcomes\nrather than underlying economic relationships – and this is not an area of comparative advantage\nfor economists.\nGiven this reality, I will spend more time this morning discussing the risks around\nforecasts than I will the forecasts themselves. In particular, I will highlight two important risks\nto the economy in the short run (trade and overheating) and two potential risks in the long run\n(reduced capacity of both fiscal and monetary policy to act against downturns).\nLet me be clear that I am identifying risks, not making a prediction that they will happen.\nI think it is important to identify risks worth thinking about and watching for, and underline why\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npolicymakers need to continuously monitor incoming economic data and make adjustments\nshould the data come in other than expected.\n\nExploring the Forecasts from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nFigure 1 provides the actual inflation rate for the core personal consumption\nexpenditures or PCE (the solid line), and the median PCE inflation forecast from FOMC\nparticipants at the March meeting (the dashed line). As is clear from the chart, we have been\nundershooting the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. This undershooting has been\nlargely due to the decline in the relative price of imports from 2014 to 2016, and the decline in\ntelecommunications prices in early 2017. But that shortfall is forecasted to end soon – and it is\nnotable that Committee members expect an overshoot of the Fed’s inflation target in the medium\nterm.\nFigure 2 shows that the unemployment rate has been declining relatively quickly since\nthe first quarter of 2015, and that Committee members expect the path to level off in the medium\nterm at well below 4 percent. Notably, the median expectation for the longer-run rate of\nunemployment – usually taken to be policymakers’ estimate of the sustainable rate – is 4.5\npercent in the March SEP (the horizontal line). Clearly, policymakers expect very tight labor\nmarkets in the short and medium term relative to what we expect to prevail in the longer term.\nFigure 3 shows the actual path of the federal funds rate from the first quarter of 2015 to\nthe first quarter of 2018, and the median of SEP projections of the federal funds rate’s path\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2020. The median forecast is for three 25-basis-point increases in\n2018 (including the increase which followed the March FOMC meeting) and another three in\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\n2019. So again, it is worth noting that the gradual rise of inflation toward – and then above – its\ntarget, and the projection for a falling unemployment rate that dips well below its estimated longrun sustainable level, occur despite the gradual tightening of monetary policy assumed in FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts. Importantly, some of the underlying economic strength in these forecasts\ncomes from the projected effects of substantial fiscal stimulus, generated both by tax cuts and by\nthe higher government spending incorporated in the recent federal budget.\nIn summary, the Committee’s median outlook is fairly optimistic. My own forecast calls\nfor an even more pronounced decline in the unemployment rate, given my expectation that\ncyclical strength in labor force participation will provide only a partial offset to solid gains in\npayrolls. Despite this positive outlook, I think it is important to consider the risks around this\nforecast. So now I will touch on what I see as some short-run risks, and then some longer-run\nrisks.\n\nShort-run Risks\nThe first risk I want to discuss today is one that has been on the front pages of\nnewspapers and has also been reflected in the increased volatility of financial markets recently:\nthe outlook for international trade. Figure 4 shows exports of goods and services relative to\nGDP from the first quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017. While the United States\nis less dependent on exports for growth than are many of our major trading partners, exports are\nstill a relatively large component of total goods and services produced in the U.S. economy. At\nroughly 12 percent of total goods and services, exports play a much smaller role in the overall\neconomy than consumption, which is roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. But exports play\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\na larger role than, for example, housing, which accounts for roughly 4 percent of the overall\neconomy. Of course, here I am taking a macroeconomic view of the economy; I recognize that\nsome industries and firms will feel more acutely any changes in the export and trade\nenvironment.\nSome context is important. It would take a significantly broader set of trade actions than\nthose reported to date to materially reduce the roughly $2.4 trillion in annual U.S. exports. Still,\nspillover effects are possible, beyond just the industries where exports could be affected by\npossible trade barriers. There could also be indirect economic effects from trade disputes with\nimportant, but difficult to measure, impacts. For example, concerns about possible supply\ndisruptions might cause firms to source supplies from other countries – and the new capacity in\nthese other countries could potentially mean less U.S. investment and employment.\nA second possible impact is on prices. As Figure 5 shows, prices of imported goods\ngrew at a slower pace than overall inflation, thus holding down overall inflation over the last\nseveral years. Indeed, imported goods prices fell until about the beginning of 2017, in part\nbecause of a strong dollar, although that trend appears to be changing more recently. Of course\nthe imposition of tariffs also pushes up prices that consumers pay for goods impacted by the\ntariff. In addition, actions to avoid possible tariffs can cause precautionary stockpiling, which\ncan disrupt the flow of orders and cause production bottlenecks. Concerns about these possible\ndisruptions likely explain some of the heightened volatility in stock prices of late.\nBeyond trade issues, there is a second short-run risk to the outlook, and it moves in the\nopposite direction. While I expect the unemployment rate to drop to 3.7 percent by the end of\nthis year, it is possible that unemployment will fall even more rapidly in the short-term. An\nundesirable “boom-bust” scenario may become more likely if unemployment moves far below\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwhere we expect labor markets to settle in the long-run. Figure 6 shows the difference between\nthe actual unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of the\nnatural rate of unemployment from 1970 to the first quarter of 2018, with recessions shaded.\nToday, unemployment is already below the CBO estimate of the natural rate. As the graph\nshows, periods in which unemployment dipped significantly and persistently below the estimated\nnatural rate historically have tended to generate conditions that resulted in a recession.\nWhile labor markets provide important indicators of potential unsustainability, it is\nimportant to be alert to financial stability issues as well. As Figure 7 shows, the spreads between\ncorporate bonds and 10-Year U.S. Treasuries have fallen to relatively low levels, and several\nacademic studies have highlighted that the investor confidence that generates low credit spreads\noften precedes subsequent economic reversals.2\nLet me reiterate that I am not forecasting significant trade disruptions or substantial\nboom-bust problems. But the risk that they could develop means we must be very carefully\nmonitoring incoming data to see if they indicate an increased probability that these risk scenarios\ncould occur.\n\nLong-run Risks\nThere are also longer-run risks that should be considered at this juncture in the economy.\nWith monetary policy still relatively accommodative, and fiscal policy quite accommodative, it\nseems unlikely that the economy would perform poorly in the near term. However, it is\nimportant to consider whether some of that accommodation may potentially generate risks that\nplay out over the longer term.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nOne of the risks is illustrated by the CBO projection of public debt levels that was\nrecently released. Gross federal debt as a percentage of GDP, shown in Figure 8, has been rising\nover the past decade. The dotted line shows the current projection through 2028. This debt-toGDP ratio will rise to levels not seen since just after World War II. My concern is this: by using\nup so much fiscal capacity now – by which I mean the ability to lower tax rates or boost federal\nspending to offset economic weakness – the country risks not having sufficient fiscal capacity in\nthe future when it might be needed. And this lack of fiscal capacity would be particularly\ntroubling if monetary policy could not aggressively offset adverse shocks.3\nFigure 9 shows that there is also some reason to be concerned about how aggressively\nmonetary policy can respond to a large adverse shock. At the onset of most previous economic\nrecessions, short-term interest rates were quite high. This provided plenty of room to reduce\ninterest rates as the economy went into recession. The one time that short-term interest rates\nreached zero in recent history was in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Once the FOMC cut\nthe short-term policy rate to its effective lower bound, reaching the limit of stimulus from that\ntool, the Federal Reserve employed its balance sheet to purchase longer-term assets, thus\nlowering longer-term interest rates and providing further monetary accommodation and stimulus.\nThese actions, which I fully supported, were nonetheless politically controversial and the subject\nof some debate among economists.4\nSo how much room do we expect to have to lower interest rates in response to future\nrecessions? The Federal Reserve’s SEP includes a forecast of where short-term interest rates\nwill settle in the long run. The most recent median forecast for the longer-run federal funds rate\nis 2.9 percent, which is quite low by historical standards. The underlying reason for this is that\nmost Committee members expect real interest rates to be quite low, due to a demographically\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\ndriven slowing in labor force growth coupled with slow growth in productivity. Combined with\na 2 percent inflation goal, this implies low long-run, short-term policy rates, implying that on\naverage we could lower rates by less than 3 percentage points in response to a recession. Since\nin many recessions we lower rates by as much as 5 percentage points, it is quite likely that\ninterest rates would reach zero again in a downturn.\nCertainly expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and perhaps using other lessconventional monetary policy interventions, can help support the economy, should it be needed.5\nHowever, several questions and concerns exist. How effective will these unconventional tools\nbe in offsetting adverse shocks? Is there significant opposition among the public and Congress\nto the Fed using nontraditional tools? How limited will fiscal policy be in buffering an adverse\nshock or downturn? These questions, while a bit sobering, highlight the need to increase the\npotential of policy buffers to respond to possible future problems.\n\nConcluding Observations\nThe outlook for the economy projected by participants in the March FOMC meeting is\nquite positive. My own forecast is somewhat stronger in terms of unemployment rates and\ninflation outcomes than the SEP forecast, which is why I am in favor of somewhat more\ntightening than the median FOMC member. However, a forecast of the most likely outcome is\nnot a promise, and there are important potential risks to that forecast. Disruptive international\ntrade actions or increasing the risk of a boom-bust economy by overextending could, in my view,\nprove problematic for the economy. And the status of fiscal and monetary “buffers” call into\nquestion their ability to work against a shock or downturn.\n\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:10 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nI am hopeful that the risks I have discussed can be avoided. Assuming these near term\nrisks are avoided, my own forecast is somewhat stronger than the SEP forecast. Of course, I\nwould support a somewhat faster increase in the federal funds rates if that stronger growth does\nindeed occur.\nIn sum, the economic outlook is good, but we must all be attuned to what could go wrong\nin the short term and in the long term, and what that implies for appropriate monetary policy.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nMeasured as the percent change in real GDP from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nSee for example, López-Salido, David, Jeremy C.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFourth Annual O. John Olcay Lecture on\nEthics and Economics at the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 27, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. I want to thank the Peterson Institute for International Economics for\ninviting me to join you today. I am truly honored to be asked to give a talk in memory of John\nOlcay, whom I met through his connection to Harvard University professor Benjamin Friedman.\nI would see John on his periodic trips to Boston; our first meeting occurred in 2007, just as\nfinancial markets were starting to show stress. John and I shared rising concerns during this\nperiod and, unfortunately, through what turned into the global financial crisis and “Great\nRecession.”\nIn those days, John was troubled by the condition of financial markets, and also had a\ndeep concern about the human implications of serious economic downturns – a topic I am going\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nto focus on today. Before I do, however, let me note that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nGiven the matters with which John was concerned, it is very fitting that this lecture series\nis focused on “Ethics and Economics.” I should note that many academic disciplines incorporate\nethics into required coursework (take medicine, philosophy, or psychology, for example), but I\nwould argue that ethics is not an especially prevalent part of the curriculum of economics. In\nmost courses, core economic concepts tend to overwhelm the syllabus and displace the study of\nethical issues. If there is any discussion of ethics in profit- or utility-maximizing frameworks,\nmy sense is that it might take place in the last week of an introductory economics class. Given\nthis underweighting in the profession, I think it is wonderful that the Peterson Institute hosts this\nseries dedicated to ethics and economics.\nToday, my remarks will focus on some of the ways in which the impact of negative\noutcomes in the economy are distributed – disproportionately, I’ll argue. These distributional\neffects have ethical dimensions that should motivate economic policymakers to do more to\nreduce the negative outcomes.\nGiven the Fed’s dual mandate – stable prices and maximum sustainable employment – it\nmakes sense for us to look at inflation and unemployment as we begin today. First, inflation:\nFigure 1 shows that there has been quite a change in the pattern of inflation over the past 50\nyears, as measured by the change in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex. In the United States, as in many advanced economies, the cyclical inflation pattern has\nbeen significantly muted. This moderation beginning around 1980 reflects, by the way, the\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nimportant role that independent central banks could and did play in dampening the inflation\ncycles seen in the past.\nHowever, Figure 2 shows that the economic cycle, as measured by the unemployment\nrate, has not been muted and has not steadily moderated like inflation.\nTo preview my main points, in my view the costs of high unemployment are\ndisproportionately borne by those who can least afford them, and a variety of actions could be\ntaken by policymakers to make periods of high unemployment less likely. This brings us to the\nethical dimension of economics. This is not just about thoughts or feelings – I want to talk today\nabout manifesting those ethical decisions in very tangible policymaking. While there are many\nexamples of policies that could mitigate periods of high unemployment, today I will address\nthree specific realms of policy – state and local government spending; bank regulatory policy;\nand finally, monetary policy.\nFirst, however, I will touch on the impact of high unemployment and its distribution\nacross several dimensions of the population.\n\nThe Distributional Impact of Periods of High Unemployment\nThe United States has spent the past nine years recovering from a severe recession. Some\npopulations in particular suffered disproportionately, and despite the recovery, historic gaps\npersist.\nFigure 3 provides the unemployment rate by racial and ethnic background from 1972 to\n2018. The overall U.S unemployment rate hit 10 percent in the most recent recession – the\n\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nsecond such time since 1972 in which the overall unemployment rate reached 10 percent.1\nHowever, it is striking that in every recession over this period, Black or African-American\nunemployment rates have exceeded 10 percent. Moreover, in the 1982 recession the Black or\nAfrican-American unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent; and in the most recent recession, the\nBlack or African-American unemployment rate exceeded 15 percent. Similarly, Hispanic\nunemployment during recessions is much more elevated than that of the overall population,\nalthough not as elevated as for Black or African-Americans.\nEconomic recessions also disproportionately impact unemployment for those with less\neducation, as shown in Figure 4. The figure shows the unemployment rate by educational\nattainment (ranging from less than a high school diploma, to a bachelor’s degree or higher) from\n1992 to 2018.2 While the unemployment rate for those with a college education reached 5\npercent during the most recent recession, the rate exceeded 15 percent for those without a high\nschool education.\nFurthermore, while unemployment significantly impacts individuals, it also affects\nfamilies. As Figure 5 shows, the share of U.S. children under age 18 who are below the poverty\nline increased significantly in the two recessions where the unemployment rate exceeded 10\npercent – with more than 20 percent of children below the poverty level during the Great\nRecession. Another sobering observation I take from this chart is that the child poverty rate in\nthe U.S. has dropped to 15 percent only once in the past nearly 60 years – hovering just above or\njust below 15 percent from 1969 to 1973.\nIn sum, the sad reality is that unemployment disproportionately affects minorities, the\nless educated, and children whose families are experiencing unemployment. The costs to both\nthe entire economy and to parts of our population are significant. In my view, if policies could\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nmitigate the severity of economic slowdowns, some of those costs could be avoided – and taking\nactions now, when the economy is strong, could be particularly important to lessening the\nseverity of a hypothetical future downturn and its impact on individuals.\n\nState and Local Government Spending\nFiscal policy is certainly not in the Fed’s portfolio of mandated responsibilities, but it has\na major impact on the economy so we must take it into account.3 Drawing on the historical\nrecord, I want to suggest some opportunities for fiscal policy to address the issues I have just\nhighlighted. In my view, state and local government financing should be designed to buffer the\neconomy during recessions, or at a minimum should not reduce the stimulative effects of\nspending when the economy is most troubled.\nHowever, Figure 6 shows that since 1960, state and local government spending tends to\ndecline when the unemployment rate is high, and increase when the unemployment rate is low.\nThis pattern likely arises from the fall in state and local tax revenues during economic\ndownturns, coupled with a desire to spend within one’s means – after all, most state and local\ngovernments face balanced budget requirements. But it tends to aggravate economic downturns\nor add additional fuel to an already humming economy (scenarios that would be characterized as\n“procyclical” in the parlance of economists). And for context, state and local government\nspending is significant in the overall economy, accounting for 11 percent of U.S. GDP, compared\nto 4 percent for residential investment (which also tends to fall in economic downturns) and 7\npercent for federal government spending.\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs I have just suggested, state and local governments likely reduce spending in\nrecessions for good reasons. I would suggest, however, that a number of steps can be taken by\nofficials that would lessen the problematic impact.\nFirst, the cyclicality of revenue sources for state and local governments can be lessened –\nin other words, revenue streams might be redesigned to move less cyclically if other competing\ngoals allow.4 For example, states that are highly dependent on capital gains taxes are much more\nlikely to experience funding shortfalls during economic downturns, so if possible, reducing this\ndependence could help.5\nSecond, steps can be taken so that the fiscal health of a state does not drive substantial\ncuts during downturns. A number of large states (such as Illinois or New Jersey) have seen\ndeterioration in their financial conditions over the past several years, as represented by declines\nin their credit ratings (Figure 7). This is, in part, the result of chronic underfunding of pension\nliabilities in some states. Ideally, a time like now – when the national economy is growing and\nemployment is robust – would be an opportunity, it seems to me, to prepare for the next\ndownturn. This would perhaps include shoring up state finances, reducing unfunded pension\nliabilities, and significantly increasing “rainy day” funds.6 I am not suggesting it would be easy,\neven in these economic times. But progress could be made. A similar argument could be made\nfor the federal government, given how beneficial it would be to have the capacity to be more\nfiscally expansive in a future recession.7\nIn sum, my view is that in the long run, states should consider how to balance the various\ncompeting goals of their fiscal approach – for example the goal of having stable revenue streams\nand of achieving progressivity. But to return to my main point, state and local governments\n\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nshould reassess their revenue structure and fiscal approach with an eye on cyclical downturns\nand the potential to lessen their impact on people, through policy.\n\nBank Regulation\nWhile it may seem somewhat counterintuitive, banking regulation can also amplify the\nbusiness cycle, and policymakers can look for ways to lessen these effects. For example,\nlenders’ losses on loans tend to increase significantly during economic downturns, reflecting\nrising unemployment and the difficulty that many households and firms have in meeting debt\nobligations during hard economic times. Figure 8 shows that nonperforming loans at U.S. banks\ntend to rise during periods of high unemployment and fall during periods of low unemployment.8\nCertain aspects of bank regulation can actually exacerbate the consequences of this trend.\nFor example, capital regulations set a threshold on how low a bank’s capital – that is, its total\nassets (e.g. loans) less its total liabilities (e.g. deposits) – can fall. While this is well-intended –\nand designed to ensure that banks can meet all their obligations – certain aspects of capital\nregulations can actually cause banks to act in a manner that essentially extends their problems to\ntheir customers in a downturn.\nWhen their capital-to-assets ratio gets too low, banks can choose to either raise their\ncapital level, or shrink assets, to restore the ratio. Raising additional capital is especially costly\nduring economic downturns, and is generally opposed by existing shareholders who do not want\ntheir ownership stake diluted.\nAs a consequence, banks most often raise the capital-to-assets ratio by shrinking assets –\nand of course, loans are key assets for banks. Thus raising the capital-to-assets ratio can mean\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nless lending at just the time the economy may need stimulus. And banks may try to reduce\ndownturn-related losses by raising interest rates or tightening lending standards – both of which\ncan hurt otherwise credit-worthy borrowers.\nIn light of all this, I would suggest that – just as state and local governments need to\nshore up their finances and build their rainy day funds during a boom – it is incumbent on a bank\nto raise more capital during good economic times so that it can deplete that fund during a\nrecession, rather than shrink loans when the economy most needs them. An important regulatory\ntool that can be used to ensure that a bank builds up this so-called rainy day fund during good\ntimes is known as the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).9\nFigure 9 shows two different ways to implement capital regulations – one using a static\ncapital requirement and one using a variable capital requirement. We see a hypothetical scenario\nin which an economic downturn leads to a loss of 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) on\ncapital. On the left, this causes the bank to fall below its capital requirement, given that the bank\nwas holding 200 basis points of excess capital. As just described, banks often react by shrinking\ntheir assets to try to satisfy their capital requirement, reducing lending when borrowers most\nneed it.\nOn the right side of Figure 9, we see an alternate scenario in which the bank has\naccumulated a CCyB of 250 basis points during the good economic times that precede the\ndownturn, as required by regulation upon the activation of the CCyB. If the CCyB is deactivated\nwhen the economic downturn occurs and losses are realized, the bank has an additional capital\nbuffer of 450 basis points. As a result of the bank’s losses stemming from the economic\ndownturn, the buffer is consumed and reduced to zero. But the 300 basis point loss does not\npush the capital ratio below what is required, and thus the incentive to reduce lending is lessened.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWhile this type of CCyB is currently being used in many European countries and in Hong\nKong, the CCyB in the United States remains at zero.10 Given the overall health of the economy\nand the relatively rich asset valuations now prevailing, it is my view that this would be the ideal\ntime to build up capital buffers in the U.S. Doing so could help address the incentive that banks\nwill have to pull back on lending to shrink assets in a future economic downturn.11\n\nMonetary Policy\nMonetary policy is primarily conducted by moving short-term interest rates. During\ngood times, the interest rate is set to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and\nat the inflation target, which is 2 percent in the United States. However, when a recession occurs\nand the unemployment rate rises, policymakers push down interest rates. This has the effect of\nlowering payments for households and firms that are borrowing, and ideally mitigates the\nseverity of the economic cycle. As Figure 10 illustrates, since the Volcker disinflation episode\nin the late 1970s and early 1980s, the short-term federal funds rate has been lowered\nsignificantly, particularly during periods of very high unemployment rates.\nHowever, in the last economic cycle the inflation rate was relatively modest, and real\ninterest rates were low because of slow growth in population and productivity, so the federal\nfunds rate began the downturn at an already relatively low level. This meant that when the\nrecession hit, as the funds rate was reduced in response, it fairly quickly hit zero. Because shortterm interest rates started off low, the extent to which they could be reduced to offset high\nunemployment rates was limited.\n\n9\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nAs Figure 11 shows, estimates of the equilibrium interest rate12 have been declining.\nAccording to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), currently Fed policymakers\nanticipate that the median federal funds interest rate in the long run is expected to be only 2.9\npercent in nominal terms. Subtracting the Fed’s 2 percent inflation goals, this implies a long-run\nreal interest rate of just 0.9 percent.\nWhile the central bank has other tools to offset economic downturns, such as expanding\nits balance sheet to lower long-term interest rates, many economists view short-term interest\nrates as a more effective (and certainly a better-tested and understood) countercyclical tool. The\nFederal Reserve can do little to change the equilibrium real interest rate in the long run, since it\nis determined more by factors such as productivity and demographics. So it is appropriate to\nconsider other ways to avoid hitting zero with short-term interest rates. One possibility is to\nconsider more flexibility with the inflation target, perhaps focusing more on an inflation range\nthan a specific number.13 One might allow the inflation target to rise within the range during\nperiods of low real rates, thus providing more room for the funds rate to fall during an economic\ndownturn.\nSuch a change in the monetary policy framework is something that should be considered,\nalong with a careful assessment of the potential costs and benefits. However, if the monetary\npolicy framework is not changed, policymakers should look at other policy tools that can more\neffectively reduce the severity of recessions.\nCurrent policy also has a role in preparing for, or postponing, the next recession. As\nFigure 12 shows, over the time period since 1960, whenever the economy significantly exceeded\nfull employment, a recession ensued. The one counter-example is the 1960s, when fiscal policy\nwas quite expansionary because of the deficit-financed Vietnam War, even though the economy\n10\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nwas already running strong with the unemployment rate below the level associated with full\nemployment. However, that period was also characterized by rising inflation, which triggered\nsignificant problems in the following decade related to elevated inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nWhether imbalances appear as higher wages and prices, or higher asset prices, correcting\nimbalances in the economy (for example, if unemployment falls below a sustainable rate)\nwithout a recession is a challenge for central banks to accomplish. As a result, I think the policy\npath that will increase the probability of a longer recession-free period is the path where the\neconomy does not run above capacity and thus, fall far below the sustainable unemployment rate.\nI put these notions forward as policymakers continue to seek ways to lessen the severity and\nimpact – particularly the disparate impact – of cyclical economic downturns.\n\nConcluding Observations\nIn summary and conclusion, while ethics is not generally a central focus of the discipline\nof economics, my view is that the costs of economic downturns – and the uneven distribution of\ntheir impact – are, in fact, ethical issues. I suspect our friend John Olcay would concur. Both in\nthe spirit of ethics and to sharpen policy effectiveness, I believe a more active discussion should\nbe occurring among fiscal, supervisory, and monetary policymakers. All of them, as I have\nsuggested today, could continue and perhaps expand their efforts to make cyclical downturns –\nand resulting periods of high unemployment – less severe.\nThank you.\n\n11\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:30 P.M.

Rosengren: “Monetary, Fiscal, and Financial Stability Policy\nTools: Are We Equipped for the Next Recession?” delivered on March 23, 2018, in Washington D.C.\n3\n\n4\n\nTax policies have multiple, often competing goals and therefore policymakers face tradeoffs. One important goal is\nto reduce income inequality. While income taxes (especially capital gains taxes) are very cyclical, they are often\nmore progressive (i.e., tax as a share of income is higher for higher-income households) than sales taxes and other\ntax vehicles.\n5\n\nCapital gains taxes are a large revenue source for many states. Cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes will\nautomatically require a very large increase in sales taxes and other taxes and fees if we talk about a revenue-neutral\nscenario.\n6\n\nLinking cyclical revenue sources (such as capital gains taxes) to rainy day funds could be a good compromise\namong maintaining high revenue-raising capacity, improving progressivity, and reducing cyclicality. In my view,\nthe macroeconomic effects have probably been underweighted. For additional discussion on the needed size of state\nrainy day funds, see 2014 Working Paper by Boston Fed Senior Economist Bo Zhao: “Saving for a Rainy Day:\nEstimating the Appropriate Size of U.S. State Budget Stabilization Funds.”\n7\n\nIt is worth noting that despite long-run fiscal challenges, lack of support during serious recessions extends the\nrecession, and thus extends the period of lost tax revenue, and exacerbates underlying woes in the state. In my view,\na short-term investment in a modest increase in indebtedness may pay back over time.\n8\n\nFurthermore, the combination of nonperforming loans and lower interest rates during recessions have the effect of\nadding pressure to banks’ earnings.\n9\n\nFor more info on the CCyB, see: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160908b.htm.\nIn addition to the CCyB, other bank regulatory tools include the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) and the Dodd-Frank Stress Tests (DFAST). There are countercyclical elements to the stress tests. More\nstressful scenarios in good times require banks to build more capital. For more on CCAR and DFAST see\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.\nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell noted in his recent press conference on June 13, 2018, “…the\ncountercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when\nfinancial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.” I am suggesting a slightly different application\nmight also be appropriate.

Rosengren\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\n60th Annual Meeting\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be speaking with you today at the 60th annual meeting\nof the National Association for Business Economics. Let me also welcome you to our wonderful\ncity of Boston.\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me note that the views I express are my own, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nLast week the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, a move consistent\nwith the very strong economic performance seen over the last two quarters. With this latest\nmonetary policy action, the federal funds rate has now been increased three times this year – and\n\n1\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nat 2 to 2-1/4 percent, it is now above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2 percent for the\nfirst time since the financial crisis and Great Recession.\nToday, U.S. monetary conditions remain mildly accommodative, with short-term market\nrates barely higher than the inflation rate (thus barely positive in real terms). And given tax cuts\nand spending realities, fiscal policy remains quite accommodative.\nGiven the accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policy, it is not surprising that\nmost private forecasters, as well as most members of the FOMC, expect the economy to grow\nstrongly for the second half of this year. Many economists expect real growth for the second half\nof this year to be approximately 3 percent. That is strong enough to further tighten labor markets\nand further push down the unemployment rate, currently at 3.9 percent. Consistent with this\nexpectation, the Blue Chip forecasters anticipate the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent by\nthe end of next year.\nThis strong U.S. economic growth is occurring despite some clear risks to the global\neconomy, which I’ll touch on today. The announcement of increased tariffs by both the U.S. and\nChina last Monday heightened concerns that trade disruptions could become a significant\nheadwind over time. In addition, several emerging market economies are now more stressed –\nparticularly those such as Turkey, whose corporations’ U.S. dollar-denominated debts have\nbecome costlier as their currency has depreciated against the dollar. And while Europe has\nshown some signs of improving, there is still the possibility of more significant disruptions\nemerging from a potentially disruptive Brexit, or from the exposure of many European banks to\nsome of the troubled emerging market economies.\n\n2\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nHow should U.S. monetary policymakers respond to these conditions – a strong U.S.\neconomy, but clear signs of rising risks emanating from other economies? I am carefully\nwatching factors that could pose risks to the continued U.S. economic expansion. But my own\nassessment is that the most likely outcome will be a U.S. labor market that continues to tighten\nand the likely buildup of economic imbalances, including, but not limited to, inflationary\npressures.\nWhile inflation remains well contained to date, pushing the economy too hard risks\ninflationary concerns or financial-stability risks. Either of these outcomes might necessitate a\nmore forceful monetary policy response. While a more forceful policy might be appropriate\nunder such conditions, it is not a risk-free strategy and could put at risk the continued expansion.\nThe history of rapid rate increases in the U.S. suggests that such a risk is real, and as a result my\npreference for a strategy that allows a continued, but gradual, pace of monetary tightening.\nAssuming the potential global risks I mentioned do not materialize and disrupt strong\nU.S. GDP growth, I believe that continuing to raise short-term rates gradually, until monetary\npolicy becomes mildly restrictive, is likely to be appropriate and beneficial over the long term.\n\nLabor Markets\nConditions in labor markets are, of course, foundational to my analysis. In every\ndiscussion I have with businesspeople in New England, a theme that continually comes up is the\ntightness of the labor market. Turning to the data, Figure 1 shows that the number of initial\nclaims for unemployment insurance is now near a series low and much lower than it has been\nduring all but one of the previous recoveries since 1967. It is not surprising that firms are not\n3\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nlaying people off, because the economy continues to be quite strong, but another factor is the\ndifficulty finding someone to replace a worker who is laid off or leaves. So layoffs may remain\nuncommon even if firms experience some slowdown in their business.\nFigure 2 shows the so-called “quits rate,” the number of people who voluntarily leave\ntheir job as a share of total employment, since 2003. Keep in mind that if you quit your job, you\ndo not qualify for unemployment insurance. So, essentially, the quits rate provides an indication\nof workers’ confidence in their ability to find a new job.\nFigure 3 shows the job openings rate – which is the number of job openings at the end of\nthe month, relative to total employment plus job openings, monthly since 2003. The job\nopenings rate is now significantly higher than at the peak before the crisis and recession. This\nmeasure of firms’ demand for labor is at its highest level since the series was first reported in late\n2000.\nFigure 4 shows the unemployment rate, which has fallen to 3.9 percent. The Blue Chip\nconsensus forecast expects it to fall to 3.5 percent by the end of next year. Such an outcome\nwould be well below most estimates of the natural, or long-run, rate of unemployment. At\npresent, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that no FOMC\nparticipant estimates the long-run unemployment rate to be lower than 4 percent. The median\nlonger-run unemployment rate projected by FOMC participants is 4.5 percent. I would suggest\nthat a forecast where the unemployment rate falls well below its estimated long-run sustainable\nlevel for a significant period of time is a sign of macroeconomic imbalance, which poses a risk of\nrising inflation or increasing financial stability concerns – or both.\n\n4\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nWages and Prices\nTurning to wages and prices, Figure 5 provides the average hourly earnings of\nproduction and nonsupervisory private-industry employees from January 2003 to August 2018.\nOver the past five years, earnings have gradually risen, and are currently roughly consistent with\nthe sum of 2 percent inflation, plus the somewhat subdued productivity gains of roughly 1\npercent.\nInterestingly, if you examine service-providing industries and goods-producing\nindustries, you see that earnings in both have been increasing. The service-providing industries’\nearnings closely match those of the total, while goods-producing industries (which include those\nthat are more export-intensive and thus more likely to be directly impacted by tariffs) have seen\nearnings increase more quickly of late – although I should note that the volatility of these\nearnings is always higher than that of services. Should the upward trend in wages continue, one\nwould expect firms to either shrink their profit margins or begin to pass on some of the costs as\nprice increases.\nFigure 6 shows total and core PCE measures of inflation. The inflation measures have\nfluctuated recently around the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target, although there is a\nmodest upward trend over the past three years. Private forecasters in the Survey of Professional\nForecasters now expect PCE inflation to be just above 2 percent both this year and next.\nConsistent with my earlier comments on tight labor markets, I personally believe there are some\nupside risks to this outlook.\nFigure 7 shows PCE inflation separately for goods and services from 2003 through the\nsecond quarter of 2018. While services PCE inflation has been a bit above 2 percent over the\n\n5\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\npast two years, the more volatile goods PCE inflation has, for the most part, been below 2\npercent – although it has been rising recently.\nAs we study price movements, we need to consider trade and tariffs. Tariffs may be\npassed through, at least in part, to prices in goods-producing industries over time. But tariffs\nmay also be used as “cover” for passing through the rising cost of labor 1 as labor markets tighten\nfurther. Indeed, many of our business contacts in New England have highlighted that they now\nreceive little resistance to passing on price increases. These anecdotes may reflect an unintended\nconsequence of the tariffs: suppliers may now feel they have more pricing flexibility, posing an\nupside risk to measured inflation.\n\nReal GDP Growth\nFigure 8 shows the pattern of real GDP growth. At 4.2 percent growth, the second\nquarter of 2018 was quite strong. However, some of this growth likely reflects shifts in the\ntiming of spending in expectation of the imposition of tariffs on some goods. For example,\nsoybean shipments increased in the second quarter, apparently to beat the imposition of tariffs;\nshipments are likely to fall now that the tariffs are in place.\nOver the second half of this year, private forecasters are expecting that real GDP growth\nwill average around 3 percent, with growth next year ranging from 2 to 2.5 percent. Since that\nexceeds what economists call the economy’s potential rate of growth (somewhat below 2\npercent), I would expect to see further declines in the unemployment rate over this horizon.\nFigure 9 provides the pattern of consumption. While consumption growth slowed\nunexpectedly in the first quarter, it rebounded in the second quarter. Most forecasters expect\n6\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nconsumer spending to be a key driver of the economy, reflecting high consumer confidence,\nrising stock and housing prices, and continued growth in personal income.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and foreign growth, the trajectory for exports of\ngoods and services remains uncertain. Exports represent a sizable share of GDP, as shown in\nFigure 10. If retaliatory tariffs roughly match the tariffs imposed by the United States, the result\ncould be a roughly equal reduction in exports and imports, leaving the trade deficit\napproximately the same.\nHowever, tariffs increase the uncertainty around the path of net exports. Trade\ndisruptions could cause countries to source their purchases from new countries, for instance – but\nin many cases this is not a change that could happen easily or quickly. Moreover, uncertainty\nabout how long the tariffs might be in place makes the decision about whether to relocate\nproduction or to find new supply sources or markets even more difficult.\nOver the past 20 years, supply chains have become increasingly interconnected across\nmany countries for any one good. As suggested above, the threat of tariffs may disrupt the\nglobal supply chains, causing firms to source from more costly (without tariffs) – but potentially\nmore dependable – suppliers. These complex supply adjustments are likely to play out over an\nextended period. This implies a modest upward bias to the inflation forecast over the next\nseveral years. In an environment of strong growth and tight labor markets, these staggered onetime price changes run a greater risk of becoming more solidly incorporated into inflation\nexpectations.\nAn added concern for exporters is the higher value of the dollar, which makes it more\ndifficult for our goods and services to remain competitive, as shown in Figure 11.\n\n7\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nRisks\nThere are certainly significant risks to the forecast. I will mention three here. First, the\nstrength of the U.S. dollar has generated complications for some emerging market economies.\nFigure 12 shows the significant currency devaluations for two emerging economies, Argentina\nand Turkey. Businesses in these countries that have borrowed in dollars will of course find it\nmore difficult to pay their debts as the value of their own currency falls relative to the dollar.\nA second challenge for emerging markets is the increase in oil prices. Many of the\nemerging economies are importers of oil that is priced in dollars (Figure 13), so rising oil prices\nonly complicate matters, as both higher dollar prices and a rising value of the dollar act as a tax\non these countries’ incomes. To the extent that emerging market growth is slowed by rising oil\nprices, this in turn will pose a challenge to U.S. growth.\nThere have also been increased concerns over a potential slowdown in China. Perhaps\nreflecting such unease, Chinese stock prices have declined recently (Figure 14). As a highly\nleveraged economy faced with significant tariffs, the risk of a more significant slowdown in the\nworld’s second largest economy should be considered.\n\nConcluding Observations\nI will conclude with a few final observations on policy. Figure 15 shows the median\npath of interest rate projections through 2021from the SEP. The median forecast in the SEP has\nthe federal funds rate rising to 3.4 percent. The median estimate for longer-run or equilibrium\ninterest rates in the SEP is 3 percent, so this implies interest rates gradually rising to become\nmildly restrictive.\n8\n\n\fEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:55 P.M. Eastern Time on Monday, October 1, 2018 OR UPON DELIVERY\n\nMy own view is generally consistent with the SEP forecasts. I believe that Federal\nReserve policymakers will likely need to move interest rates gradually from a mildly\naccommodative stance to a mildly restrictive stance in order to best fulfil our mandate – stable\nprices and maximum sustainable growth.\nWhile this amounts to one person’s forecast, it is important to note that it is fully\nconsistent with a forecast of GDP growth above potential that leads to further tightening of labor\nmarkets, and inflation mildly overshooting the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Of course, if\nsome of the risks that I have highlighted today become more germane to the outlook, a different\npolicy path would be warranted.\nThank you.\n\n1\n\nAdjusted for productivity.\n\n9\n\n\f",
