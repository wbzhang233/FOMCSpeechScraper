        "content": "Last Updated: 02�14�24\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee provided an update of his views on the U�S� economy and monetary policy\nFebruary 14, 2024, during a moderated Q&A hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City as part of the\nC� Peter McColough Series on International Economics� Below are planned talking points Goolsbee prepared for the event\nand shared with reporters in advance�\nThe views expressed are his own and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee�\nNearly every serious reduction in very high in�ation until now has come with a deep recession, in the United States and\nelsewhere� Yet in 2023, in�ation according to the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures �PCE� was down about 3\npercentage points from a year earlier—one of the biggest drops in 50 years—with GDP growth remaining strong and the\nunemployment rate holding steady at well below 4 percent�\nAs we enter 2024, a number of considerations are in�uencing my thinking about the economy and monetary policy:\n1� Over the past seven months core PCE in�ation �which strips out volatile food and energy prices� has been running at\nthe Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target or even below� Rate cuts should be tied to con�dence in being on a path toward\nthe target� I don’t support waiting until in�ation on a 12-month basis has already achieved 2 percent to begin to cut\nrates�\n• More data like we have seen in the past six months would indicate that path, but that’s probably too stringent� Even if\nin�ation comes in a bit higher for a few months �as many forecasts suggest�, it would still be consistent with our path back to\ntarget�\n• Over the past six months the news on goods prices has been especially favorable and even in�ation in PCE services not\nincluding housing has made good progress� But over the past few months the deceleration in housing services in�ation has not\n\nPrivacy - Terms\n\n\fbeen as fast as expected� That is at odds with market data on rents for new leases, so I expect improvements to resume� Still,\nthat puzzle got bigger with the Consumer Price Index �CPI� data yesterday, and it is something I am watching�\n• Given how variable monthly in�ation is, it’s always important not to judge a trend from one month’s number� Progress is best\nmeasured in three-, six-, and 12-month increments� Remember, also, that the Fed’s 2 percent target is for PCE in�ation, not CPI\nin�ation� They can di�er somewhat signi�cantly in some important aspects, especially in regard to some of the components that\nhave behaved strangely as of late, like housing and other services� So, we will need to see what those PCE data show�\n2� Our current policy stance is quite restrictive�\n• The nominal federal funds rate is in the 5-1�4 to 5-1�2 percent range� Adjusting for market pricing for in�ation over the next\nyear, that translates into a real federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 3 percent� This is as high as it has been in decades and\nwell above the long-run real rate of 0�5 percent laid out in the median Summary of Economic Projections �SEP�� I think it’s\nworth acknowledging that if we stay this restrictive for too long, we will start having to worry about the employment side of the\nFed’s mandate�\n3� Supply developments have been important for both in�ation and output�\n• Last year we experienced favorable supply developments after several years of negative supply shocks �mostly due to\ndisruptions from Covid�� Supply chain bottlenecks were largely resolved, and the labor supply was quite strong� These were\npositives for both growth and in�ation in 2023�\n• Even after the underlying adjustments are done, it can take some time for their e�ects to work their way through the\neconomy� So supply may continue to help us in 2024�\n• Productivity growth has rebounded in the past year at a rate much higher than we expected� If this continues, it would have\nprofound implications for our policymaking, similar to the experience during the late 1990s when persistently strong\nproductivity gains allowed for a period of faster growth and higher wages without generating higher in�ation�\n• It’s important to remember that in the presence of favorable supply movements and stronger productivity growth, strong\noutput or employment growth numbers are not reliable indicators of an overheating economy�\n4� In�ation expectations have remained in check—evidence of the Fed’s credibility�\n• Even when the rate of in�ation hit 7 percent in 2022, long-run in�ation expectations did not rise by much�\n• The Federal Reserve promised to get in�ation back down to target, and it backed up its words by increasing the federal funds\nrate over 500 basis points� And the markets believed the Fed� Economic research since the 1970s has shown how important\ncentral bank credibility is for �ghting in�ation�\n• In�ation expectations are the natural place for in�ation to settle out after supply adjustments have run their course rather\nthan something higher� That’s part of why I have not agreed with the view that the last mile will be the hardest in the �ght to\nget in�ation back to target�\n\nQuick Links\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAustan Goolsbee's Biography\nThe Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate\nUpcoming Events\nPress Kit\nNewsroom\n\nContact Us\nYour Email Address\nComments\n\nSubmit\n\n\f"
