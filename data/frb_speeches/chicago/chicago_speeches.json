            "content": "Last Updated: 02�14�24\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee provided an update of his views on the U�S� economy and monetary policy\nFebruary 14, 2024, during a moderated Q&A hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City as part of the\nC� Peter McColough Series on International Economics� Below are planned talking points Goolsbee prepared for the event\nand shared with reporters in advance�\nThe views expressed are his own and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee�\nNearly every serious reduction in very high in�ation until now has come with a deep recession, in the United States and\nelsewhere� Yet in 2023, in�ation according to the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures �PCE� was down about 3\npercentage points from a year earlier—one of the biggest drops in 50 years—with GDP growth remaining strong and the\nunemployment rate holding steady at well below 4 percent�\nAs we enter 2024, a number of considerations are in�uencing my thinking about the economy and monetary policy:\n1� Over the past seven months core PCE in�ation �which strips out volatile food and energy prices� has been running at\nthe Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target or even below� Rate cuts should be tied to con�dence in being on a path toward\nthe target� I don’t support waiting until in�ation on a 12-month basis has already achieved 2 percent to begin to cut\nrates�\n• More data like we have seen in the past six months would indicate that path, but that’s probably too stringent� Even if\nin�ation comes in a bit higher for a few months �as many forecasts suggest�, it would still be consistent with our path back to\ntarget�\n• Over the past six months the news on goods prices has been especially favorable and even in�ation in PCE services not\nincluding housing has made good progress� But over the past few months the deceleration in housing services in�ation has not\n\nPrivacy - Terms\n\n\fbeen as fast as expected� That is at odds with market data on rents for new leases, so I expect improvements to resume� Still,\nthat puzzle got bigger with the Consumer Price Index �CPI� data yesterday, and it is something I am watching�\n• Given how variable monthly in�ation is, it’s always important not to judge a trend from one month’s number� Progress is best\nmeasured in three-, six-, and 12-month increments� Remember, also, that the Fed’s 2 percent target is for PCE in�ation, not CPI\nin�ation� They can di�er somewhat signi�cantly in some important aspects, especially in regard to some of the components that\nhave behaved strangely as of late, like housing and other services� So, we will need to see what those PCE data show�\n2� Our current policy stance is quite restrictive�\n• The nominal federal funds rate is in the 5-1�4 to 5-1�2 percent range� Adjusting for market pricing for in�ation over the next\nyear, that translates into a real federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 3 percent� This is as high as it has been in decades and\nwell above the long-run real rate of 0�5 percent laid out in the median Summary of Economic Projections �SEP�� I think it’s\nworth acknowledging that if we stay this restrictive for too long, we will start having to worry about the employment side of the\nFed’s mandate�\n3� Supply developments have been important for both in�ation and output�\n• Last year we experienced favorable supply developments after several years of negative supply shocks �mostly due to\ndisruptions from Covid�� Supply chain bottlenecks were largely resolved, and the labor supply was quite strong� These were\npositives for both growth and in�ation in 2023�\n• Even after the underlying adjustments are done, it can take some time for their e�ects to work their way through the\neconomy� So supply may continue to help us in 2024�\n• Productivity growth has rebounded in the past year at a rate much higher than we expected� If this continues, it would have\nprofound implications for our policymaking, similar to the experience during the late 1990s when persistently strong\nproductivity gains allowed for a period of faster growth and higher wages without generating higher in�ation�\n• It’s important to remember that in the presence of favorable supply movements and stronger productivity growth, strong\noutput or employment growth numbers are not reliable indicators of an overheating economy�\n4� In�ation expectations have remained in check—evidence of the Fed’s credibility�\n• Even when the rate of in�ation hit 7 percent in 2022, long-run in�ation expectations did not rise by much�\n• The Federal Reserve promised to get in�ation back down to target, and it backed up its words by increasing the federal funds\nrate over 500 basis points� And the markets believed the Fed� Economic research since the 1970s has shown how important\ncentral bank credibility is for �ghting in�ation�\n• In�ation expectations are the natural place for in�ation to settle out after supply adjustments have run their course rather\nthan something higher� That’s part of why I have not agreed with the view that the last mile will be the hardest in the �ght to\nget in�ation back to target�\n\nQuick Links\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAustan Goolsbee's Biography\nThe Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate\nUpcoming Events\nPress Kit\nNewsroom\n\nContact Us\nYour Email Address\nComments\n\nSubmit\n\n\f"

Goolsbee\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fSpeech by President Austan Goolsbee\nat the Chicago Payments Symposium\nAustan D. Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nWelcome. I‘m Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,\n\nand it’s my privilege to kick off the Chicago Payments Symposium. Now in its 23rd\n\nyear, the Symposium is a testament to the Chicago Fed’s long-standing commitment to\n\ncollaboration with the industry on payments. It’s great to see all of you here in Chicago\nand online.\n\nBefore I start, I would like to personally thank Ellen Bromagen for her leadership both\n\nhere at the Chicago Fed and in payments across the Federal Reserve System and for her\nwork with Shonda Clay in putting this conference together. I would also like to thank\n\ncolleagues from across the Fed System here with us today: Loretta Mester, Mark Gould,\nKathy Paese, and Ken Montgomery. Thank you for your leadership and partnership.\n\nI want to also acknowledge the many leaders from the payments industry who are here\ntoday. We are grateful for your collective work managing the payments system and for\n\nyour longstanding collaboration with the Fed. Some of you have traveled a long way, and\nwe appreciate you making the effort to be here.\n\nIt’s my first time so let me give a brief line about why I am here. I am an economist. In\n\nthe Great Financial Crisis, I was the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and\nchief economist for the Economic Recovery Advisory Board and its head Paul Volcker. I\nhave said ever since that everyone that lived through that time has a lifetime interest in\nthe plumbing behind the financial system.\n\n2\n\n\fBut before the financial crisis and then after—for 28 years—I was a professor at the\n\nUniversity of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where one of my main areas of research\nwas the economics of innovation and of the Internet. For many years I taught the class on\nplatform strategy.\n\nSo combining a love of payments with an interest in networks and platforms brought me\nright here: to the Payments Symposium. And looking through the themes of this year’s\n\nspeakers, I’m struck by how several of the key themes facing payments today overlap with\nthings from platform economics, whether online business in the twenty-first century,\ntelecom in the twentieth, or even railroads in the nineteenth.\n\nThe starting point for platform business is that the size of the network has value to\n\neveryone because people connect to each other. The value of the network rises for each\n\nparticipant the more people add to it. And it makes it extra important that people work\ntogether to unlock the potential of the network as a whole.\n\nYou can probably already see where I’m going here with payments. But let me make two\nand a half points in the spirit of what-to-expect-when-platform-economics-meets-thepayments-symposium that come from the need for us to work together.\n\nI. Ubiquity is critical to unlock the full value of an instant payments network but\nis mostly impossible without strong coordination and will involve tradeoffs.\nBigger networks are useful. But building a big network is expensive. Users have\n\nconnection costs and network infrastructure is generally a huge investment. Because\n\nuncoordinated investment is risky in this way, it’s usually easier to build smaller networks\nthat are faster and cheaper and reach fewer participants.\n\n3\n\n\fBut fragmented investments where different users end up with different standards can\nprevent the system from ever reaching its full potential value.\n\nWide accessibility of payments networks is one of the Fed’s explicit policy goals, as\n\nrecognized by the Monetary Control Act, which requires that the Fed take into account\nthe provision of an adequate level of service nationwide. The propensity for individual\n\nactors to start with the highest margin, lowest cost, easiest-to-service customers makes it\n\nespecially important for there to be a broader push for ubiquity. The Fed has often played\na key role as a force for expansion while collaborating with the financial and technology\nprivate sectors to make something ubiquitous and better than it would be segmented.\n\nFor example, some of you may remember working together 20 years ago to implement\nwidespread use of check imaging technology after the passage of the Check 21 Act. Or\nthe efforts for ACH payments to take off in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nOr even farther back, the introduction of magnetic ink technology for checks.\nIn the 1950s, the Fed and the banking industry considered other options to automate\ncheck processing, like bar codes or punch cards, but magnetic ink had some clear\n\nadvantages. It was still readable by the human eye and also still readable by a machine,\n\neven if someone wrote over it or spilled a cup of coffee on it. To make it work, everyone\nhad to agree on a standard way to place magnetic characters on checks for machines to\nread. The Fed and the American Bankers Association jointly campaigned for adopting\nthe technology, emphasizing the benefits for the banking system as a whole, and the\n\nresponsibilities of individual banks over and above their own cost-benefit calculations.1\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, 1960, “Electronic check handling,” Economic Policy Review, Vol. 42, No. 8,\npp. 7–10, available online, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/economic-policy-review-federal-reserve-bank-new-york-1170/\naugust-1960-2530/electronic-check-handling-259448.\n\n1\n\n4\n\n\fBottom line, without extensive cooperation and collaboration, this history might have\n\nunfolded very differently. Our predecessors knew that building out a large network was\nkey. They couldn’t just rely on individual companies to do it themselves.\n\nBut history also shows us that it’s hard work getting a network all the way to ubiquity,\n\neven with a lot of collaboration. The rollout of ACH in the 1970s took a lot of time. We\nhad to overcome inertia but also improve technology. ACH initially relied primarily on\nmagnetic tapes. Each tape could hold information equivalent to 1.5 million checks, but\n\nthey still needed to be physically couriered to and from banks. Even as some banks moved\nto electronic communication of ACH payments, others continued to rely on tapes or the\n\nnext new thing, floppy disks. Because ACH processing schedules needed to accommodate\nthe slowest endpoints, even small numbers of nonelectronic users slowed the network.\n\nACH operators began to mandate all-electronic communications in the late 1980s and\n\nearly 1990s and worked together with financial institutions extensively to get them ready.\nIf there had not been cooperation, many of these now ubiquitous systems would probably\nnever have caught on. Or, at the least, would not have reached the levels of convenience\nand quality that they enjoy today.\n\nDeveloping a vibrant instant payments regime in the U.S. will require heavy investments\nin the ubiquity of the network done by all of us working together.\n\nII. The international payments system is a fragmented network all its own\nWe would be remiss at an international symposium like this not to highlight the similar\nset of challenges and opportunities facing the international payments system.\n\nThe global payments sector is also highly fragmented and with multiple overlapping\n\nlayers, including links between correspondent banks; messaging systems such as Swift;\n\nmoney transfer businesses and credit card networks; as well as foreign exchange markets,\n\n5\n\n\fand arrangements between central banks.2 Each of these entities answers to its own\n\nauthority, and the reputations and security practices of network participants vary widely.\n\nThere is also the well-established challenge of aligning the standards of various sovereign\npayments systems—a task made all the harder if conflicts like the one in Ukraine lead to\nwhat the IMF has called “economic blocs” that restrict cross-border flows.\n\nAnd the global payments system is expensive. According to the World Bank, the average\ncross-border payment carries a 6.3% fee. We know that smaller volume senders tend to\npay higher fees—which means the 6.3% data point probably understates the actual fees\npaid by many households and small businesses when they send money across borders.\nThe same idea of how expanding the network will raise the value of the system for\n\neveryone suggests there is an important role for collaboration across countries, too. It will\nbe more challenging in many of the participating countries because there is no mandating\nauthority. The lessons we are learning about encouraging voluntary adoption in the\nUnited States may be helpful in the global context, too.\n\nIII. Security in instant payments will be crucial for adoption but will also be a\nchallenge because of the fragmented environment\n\nOne of the biggest potential barriers to the ubiquitous adoption of any network is\n\nsecurity. For instant payments, it is absolutely critical for all of us—the Fed, industry,\neveryone with a seat at the table—to get security right from the start or lapses will\n\notherwise undermine the network’s growth and reach. That’s the thing about network\nexternality businesses—getting users begets more users, but losing users snowballs on\nitself, too. Early negative experiences can set back adoption for a long time.\n\nKristalina Georgieva, 2022, Confronting Fragmentation: How to Modernize the International Payment System,\nconcluding remarks at the IMF-Swiss National Bank High-Level Conference, Zurich, May 10, available online, https://\nwww.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/05/10/sp051022-md-concluding-remarks-at-the-snb-high-level-conference.\n\n2\n\n6\n\n\fA key lesson from network economics is the ever-present conflict of incentives between\nan individual participant—who is understandably focused on their own wellbeing, and\n\nin fact isn’t powerful enough to protect the network on their own—and the needs of the\n\nbroader group, which inherently relies on collective action to solve for security. In effect,\nnetworks must always be considering the same two questions:\n•\n\nAre current incentives going to get us the systemwide developments that we need and\n\n•\n\nOr, is everybody going to have an incentive just to look at their own business and\n\nthat everybody can benefit from?\n\nwell-being, which leads to haphazard evolution, as well as innovations that cause\nrather than solve problems?\n\nA timely example that illustrates this issue is fraud, a hot topic across the entire payments\necosystem, not just instant payments. Like with ubiquity, the best answers we have to\nfraud come from cross-industry collaboration. The trick is aligning incentives so that\nparticipants can work together as network participants, even as they compete against\n\none another in the economy every day. For the wellbeing of the network, both of these\npostures—collaborator and competitor—can and must exist simultaneously.\n\nIn the case of fraud, some of these learnings are baked into the design of FedNow.\n\nFor example, network participants—banks, credit unions, and payments companies—\n\nare obligated through network rules to report fraud that takes place on FedNow. The\nmandatory reporting not only helps remove stigma associated with self-reporting\nproblems, but also helps the Fed and the industry better monitor and address\nwarning signs.\n\nWe also know that some of the most valuable collective work is collegial and cultural,\nsuch as work groups of network participants that share candid information and fraud\nmitigation strategies.\n\n7\n\n\fIn a sense, fraud and security are always individual events, because they have specific\nvictims and costs. But the broader reality is that fraud—just like any other network\n\nsecurity risk—is a collective issue that relies on collective efforts and collaboration to\nmaintain safety and security.\n\nI know collaboration has been a key theme of this conference for more than two decades,\nand will no doubt be a key ingredient of this gathering for years to come.\n\nIt is an exciting moment in the history of the financial system, and we don’t know how\nthings will end up.\n\nIt feels like the long history of other platforms in the economy has taught us that\n\nbalancing cooperation and innovation to help the entire system achieve its full potential\nwill remain front and center, and I can’t wait to see what you all come up with.\nThanks for being here. Now let’s get to work.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Goolsbee\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, DC\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fThe 2023 Economy: Not Your\nGrandpa’s Monetary Policy Moment\nAustan D. Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nIntroduction\nWhen I finished school many years ago, I headed to Chicago. My grandfather called me\nwith advice. Grandpa Jack lived on a ranch outside Abilene, Texas, had served in World\nWar II, and was one of those Greatest Generation wise men. He told me, “This is your\nfirst job, and you’ll need to save money. So let me tell you something very important:\nNever. Buy. Stocks.”\n\nI paused, was Grandpa Jack an efficient markets guy? I asked, “No individual stocks?”\n“No,” he said, “don’t buy any stocks. Your grandmother and I had friends who bought\nstocks. They lost everything when the market crashed.”\n\nHe was talking about the Great Depression. This one historical event scarred his\n\nthinking for 65-plus years and, evidently, led him to miss out on a few thousand percent\ncumulative return.\n\nGrandpa Jack’s life experience made him a font of wisdom about many things—and\n\nhis background in meteorology during World War II meant he could give a stunningly\n\naccurate forecast just by looking at the clouds—but, clearly, in personal finance not every\n\nhistorical lesson is helpful for every moment. Today, I will argue the same may be true for\nmonetary policy.\n\n2\n\n\fHistory has taught us that bringing down high inflation without causing a major\n\nrecession is an extraordinarily rare and difficult task. Indeed, there is what I will call a\n\n“traditionalist view” that says the substantial resource slack generated by a deep recession\nis necessary to reduce strong inflationary pressures—and that delaying taking this bitter\n\nmedicine risks unhinging inflation expectations, making the job even more difficult. The\n\nU.S. inflation experience in the 1970s and ’80s is the one most etched in our minds, but\nother economies around the world have similar stories to tell.\n\nThis traditionalist view tempts us into looking at current growth and labor market\n\nconditions as the primary predictors of whether inflation is returning to target. This\nmorning I will argue that this view misses key features of our recent inflationary\n\nexperience and that, in today’s environment, believing too strongly in the inevitability of\na large trade-off between inflation and unemployment comes with the serious risk of a\nnear-term policy error.\n\nBefore continuing, let me bring some relief to my colleagues by giving the usual\n\ndisclaimer: The views I am expressing are my own and not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe traditionalist view\nAs I noted, bringing inflation down several percentage points in a reasonable period of\n\ntime without suffering a severe recession and painfully high unemployment is historically\nquite rare. Many commentators have that historical perspective in mind when arguing\nthat returning U.S. inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target will be painful.\n\nThis perspective is also a statistical feature of many econometric models in the longestablished literature identifying the effects of monetary policy shocks. Their results\n\n3\n\n\fgenerally are consistent with a flat Phillips curve, so that a steep decline in activity is\n\nnecessary to bring inflation down a lot. The research staff at the Chicago Fed recently\n\nupdated a version of this analysis based on the work of Romer and Romer (2004) and\nusing data going back to the 1960s.1\n\nThe chart shows the changes in the log levels of gross domestic product (GDP) and\n\nemployment and the core PCE inflation rate2 that we would expect to see based on estimated\n\nhistorical relationships and Fed policy moves to date. Recall that when the Fed first increased\nrates in March of last year, core PCE inflation was nearly 5-1/2 percent. The historically\n\nFor additional information on the Chicago Fed research staff’s recent update of this analysis, please contact Mark Peters at\nMark.Peters@chi.frb.org.\n2\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Core\ninflation strips out the volatile food and energy sectors and is a better indicator of underlying inflation trends than is\ntotal inflation.\n1\n\n4\n\n\fbased dynamics show inflation would not be expected to start moving down until\n\nsometime next year and it would come with a large recession and the recession would\nhave already started prior to inflation moderating.\n\nThe red lines here show our actual experience so far. Notice how the real data have not\n\nfollowed the historical patterns at all. There are three points I want to make. First, GDP\n\nfell more quickly than the typical policy tightening effect. While the level at this moment\nis close to its average response, the typical pattern has further steep declines coming.\n\nSecond, employment has been much stronger than expected, so it would need to weaken a\nlot to follow the typical relationship. Third, inflation fell much sooner than the historical\n\n5\n\n\faverage. And if past correlations were to hold, most of the reduction in inflation from\nmonetary policy actions to date is still to come, and it would be large.\n\nThis traditional approach leaves us with a puzzle. Core inflation began moving down in\n\n2023—not mid-2024. And it did so while the job market was still strong—not after it had\nalready weakened substantially. For the traditionalist, the answer is that it must be noise:\nJust wait; the real economy will get much worse.\n\nIt’s possible. But another answer is that something very different is going on: Either\n\nnonmonetary shocks are heavily influencing the economy or the nature of the monetary\npolicy environment we are working in today is different. I believe both of these factors\n\nare at play. If so, we need to be extra careful about indexing policy to this traditional view\nof what the incoming data on output and the labor market mean for the inflation outlook.\nSources of inflation\nLet’s start with the sources of inflation. Recall that inflation began to soar in 2021 even as\nthe unemployment rate exceeded 6 percent and GDP was well below previous estimates\n\nof potential output. Such elevated slack should have lowered inflation, not raised it. Also,\n\ninflation surged all over the world, including in places with different fiscal responses, also\nsuggesting something else was at work.3\n\nIn my view, the most important factors were Covid-related. There were well documented\n\nnegative supply chain shocks and unusual shifts in the composition of demand. Adding to\n\nsupply side difficulties, Covid reduced labor supply as labor force participation—especially\nfor women and those nearing retirement—dropped and immigration collapsed.\n\n3\n\nHobijn et al. (2023).\n\n6\n\n\fThere are analysts who don’t agree with the predominantly-supply-shocks view of\ninflation. They observe that supply chain disruptions and severe labor dislocations\n\ntypically impact isolated sectors and, therefore, show up as a few relative price changes\nrather than a widespread increase in prices across the board.\n\nIt’s worth reexamining the evidence on our actual experience, though. I think a lot of the\nevidence points to the supply disruption channel. Chad Syverson’s (2023) contribution\nto this year’s Jackson Hole conference showed substantial differences in inflation across\na wide range of industries, with the biggest price increases associated with the smallest\nincreases in quantity, fully consistent with the role of supply shocks as an important\ndriver of overall inflation.\n\nResearch with a more macroeconomic focus also finds a large role for supply shocks,\n\nsuch as recent papers by Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) and Liu and Nguyen (2023).\n\nOur Chicago Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model ascribes a large\nportion of the run-up in inflation to supply shocks as well.4\n\nFortunately, the negative supply shocks and demand distortions have been unwinding\nsteadily, which have been important factors in bringing inflation down over the past\n\nyear or so. Most metrics indicate that supply chains have improved considerably—also\ncorroborated by our business contacts—and that improvement is likely to continue\nworking its way through the economy.\n\nWe have also seen increases in labor supply. The prime-age labor force participation\n\nrate is at its highest level since 2001. Perhaps because of more flexible post-Covid work\narrangements, the female labor force participation rate is hitting record highs, as is the\nparticipation rate for those with disabilities. Immigration has recovered as well.\n\n4\n\nCampbell et al. (2023).\n\n7\n\n\fHolding to the simple historical correlations of what growth and labor market\n\nconditions mean for inflation in the face of positive supply developments is a recipe for\n\novershooting and causing an unnecessary downturn. Tying monetary policy too closely to\ncontemporary output and labor market readings today risks giving a decidedly\nwrong answer.\n\nAnchored inflation expectations\nThe second reason I think the traditionalist perspective on the current underlying\n\neconomic environment may miss the mark is the role of central bank credibility in\n\nkeeping inflation expectations anchored now versus in past periods of high inflation.\nRegardless of what causes inflation, if high inflation rates get rolled into expectations\nof future inflation, it makes the job of reducing inflation that much harder. This is\n\nwhat happened in the 1970s: As inflationary psychology took hold, breaking it became\n\nextremely costly. It took much more aggressive tightening because inflation expectations\nhad ratcheted up over time.\n\n8\n\n\fIf economic agents make wage and price setting decisions that are consistent with their\nexpectations, then inflation expectations become a strong attractor for actual inflation\n\nitself. Long-run inflation expectations that are anchored at our inflation target become an\nimportant force returning inflation to target with less economic pain than was needed in\nthe past.\n\n9\n\n\fAnd as can be seen by these graphs, today long-run inflation expectations indeed appear\n\nto be well anchored. There are different ways to measure inflation expectations. The top\npanel shows a survey-based measure, and the bottom panel is a market-based measure.\n\nBoth tell a similar story: Longer-run inflation expectations, shown in red, have not moved\nmuch during this entire inflationary episode.\n\nThe idea that anchored inflation expectations can pull down inflation without as much\n\neconomic damage as has happened in the past (when expectations lost their anchor) is\nanother important reason to downweight the traditionalist view right now. Of course,\n\nthis anchoring didn’t come out of thin air; it hinges on a belief in the inflation-fighting\n\n10\n\n\fcredibility of the Fed. In turn, appropriate monetary policy actions and communications\naimed at hitting our inflation target reinforce credibility, anchor inflation expectations,\nand support the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThere is a lot of research studying this channel. One example is a model developed by\n\ntwo Chicago Fed economists, Stefania D’Amico and Tom King.5 Standard models—such as\n\nvector autoregressions (VARs) that capture the traditionalist view I talked about earlier—\ngenerally have no independent role for forward-looking behavior. They only pick up\nwhatever is captured by the average dynamics estimated in the model.\n\nStefania and Tom’s model explicitly accounts for measures of private sector expectations\nof activity, inflation, and interest rates, allowing them to identify shocks to both the\ncurrent policy rate and the expected path going forward. The model estimates that\n\nthroughout this tightening cycle the public has formed expectations for tighter policy well\nin advance of actual changes in the policy rate.\n\n5\n\nD’Amico and King (2023).\n\n11\n\n\fThis results in more front-loaded effects on output and inflation than traditional analyses\n\nshow, and although the confidence intervals are large, the forecasts from the model shown\nhere have inflation reaching target soon, with only a modest slowing in GDP growth—\nwhat I have called the “golden path.” And these outcomes are achieved without further\npolicy tightening.\n\nNow, some people don’t like the specific assumptions of any particular model. So fine.\n\nForget the models. If you think expectations matter, just go look at them. Today, market\n\nparticipants largely expect the Fed to raise rates only a bit more and then hold them there\nfor a while. And their economic forecasts generally see inflation getting down to target\n\n12\n\n\fwithout a major recession, pretty much in line with the “golden path.” And as long as they\nexpect that, it makes the outcome easier to achieve.\n\nOn a side note, the importance of inflation expectations and Fed credibility is why I think\nrecent proposals to change the inflation target to something higher are quite risky. To do\nso now would undermine the power of expectations to bring actual inflation down. No\nmatter what level the target, no matter what measure of inflation, the whole benefit of\n\nannouncing a target comes from people expecting that you will do what it takes to achieve\nit. Raising the target when inflation is above the target would undermine the credibility of\n\nthe Fed’s commitment to any inflation target and impairs the very mechanism of how it is\nsupposed to help. It’s a recipe for ratcheting up inflation expectations just like we saw in\nthe old days.\nRisks\nThe unwinding of supply shocks, the composition of demand returning to more stable\npatterns, and Fed credibility are central to why I think it might be possible today to\n\nreduce inflation while avoiding a deep recession. These factors also argue against putting\ntoo much weight on the idea that strong labor market and growth conditions will\n\nnecessarily stall out the disinflationary process. Doing so risks policy overshooting and\nunnecessarily derailing the expansion.\n\nOf course, the golden path is not guaranteed. External shocks pose risks to the outlook.\nEarlier, less challenging soft landings such as in 1990 and 2001 were derailed by such\n\nshocks. Today we are faced with oil price hikes, the slowdown in China, the possibility\n\nof an expanded and prolonged auto strike, and the potential for a disruptive government\nshutdown. Each of these shocks could have important effects on the economy—either\n\n13\n\n\fdirectly or indirectly through consumer and business confidence or through\nfinancial markets.\n\nWhat to pay attention to?\nSo, if I am arguing that at this moment real-side economic conditions are not the primary\nthing telling us how soon we will get to target inflation, what should an empirically\n\nminded data dog pay closest attention to over the next few quarters? I will give you my\nbig four.\n\nOne, watch the composition of price dynamics. I and others have remarked on this\n\nbefore, so let me be brief. Core inflation getting back to 2 percent must come from a\ncombination of falling inflation for goods, housing,6 and nonhousing services. Before\n\nCovid, core inflation was actually running steadily somewhat below 2 percent. Over that\ntime goods prices were falling about 1 percent, housing prices were rising about\n\n3 percent, and inflation for services excluding housing was close to 2.5 percent. So, scale\nthose up a few tenths and you have an idea of where we need to be heading.\n\nLooking at recent three-month annualized changes, we already got core Consumer Price\nIndex (CPI) inflation down to 2.4 percent; we’ll update that for core PCE tomorrow,\n\nbut we have made excellent progress and wouldn’t be far from target if we can sustain it.\nMuch of that improvement came from goods inflation getting back down to about\n\n–1 percent as before Covid. Housing inflation has fallen noticeably in recent months, and\n\nmore is expected given the leading data on new-tenant market rents. Nonhousing services\ninflation is still near 4 percent, and given the persistence of inflation here, only small\n\nand gradual improvements can be expected for this piece. All this means that over the\n\nnext few quarters the key to further progress will be what happens to housing inflation.\n\n6\n\nHousing includes tenants’ and owners’ equivalent rent.\n\n14\n\n\fContinued progress would bode well, but there is a risk that recent increases in home\n\nprices could spill over to market rents and stall the improvement here. So, this is a critical\nrisk to monitor.\n\nTwo, watch productivity growth. Here there has been a little good news that affects\n\nthe prospects for both growth and real wages. Productivity data are notoriously noisy,\n\nbut it appears as if we could be settling in at a trend rate not far from what it was prepandemic, instead of the lower rate we were running in 2022 and early ’23. If so, the\n\npace of long-run nominal output or wage growth consistent with our 2 percent inflation\ntarget would not be as low as some have feared.\n\nThree, don’t obsess over the near-term path for real wages. Many have expressed concern\n\nthat a tight labor market with wages rising faster than prices would result in a wage–price\nspiral. Some have gone further and implicitly argued that the Fed’s stopping rule should\nbe tied to getting wage growth down to a level consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nWe need to be especially careful about that type of argument. Over long periods of\n\ntime, wages (adjusted for productivity) and prices grow in tandem. In the shorter term,\nhowever, wages generally are stickier than prices. This tends to make unit labor costs a\n\nlagging indicator of inflation.7 This doesn’t mean that wages are unimportant. They are\n\na major input cost to most industries. But it does mean we shouldn’t be using short-\n\nterm wage growth to predict inflation; indexing our monetary policy decisions to it at a\nmoment of transition like this would almost certainly mean overshooting.\n\nAnd four, keep your eye on inflation expectations. As I noted earlier, their role is central\nto our effort. Expectations currently show a benign view of the economy and the road\nback to stable target inflation. The fact that they do makes the job that much more\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to labor productivity.\nIncreases in compensation that are accompanied by rising productivity do not necessarily add to production costs. See\nBarlevy and Hu (2023).\n\n7\n\n15\n\n\fachievable. But if the influence of improved supply conditions wanes too quickly or other\nfactors impinge on the disinflationary process, rising inflationary expectations could be\none of the early signals that policy needs to adjust.\nConclusion\nAt the end of the day, we will get inflation back to our target, whatever that takes.\n\nInflation still needs to come down. But we also can’t lose sight of the fact that the Fed\n\nhas the chance to achieve something quite rare in the history of central banks—to defeat\n\ninflation without tanking the economy. If we succeed, the golden path will be studied for\nyears. If we fail, it will also be studied for years. But let’s aim to succeed.\n\nAnd like with my grandpa’s investment tips, let’s be prepared to recognize when historical\n\nlessons might not work that well for today’s environment. No, at this moment, it feels like\nthe Fed might do better following Grandpa Jack’s West Texas ranch advice instead: “Work\n’til it’s dark and pray for rain.”\nThank you.\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\nBarley, Gadi, and Luojia Hu, 2023, “Unit labor costs and inflation in the non-housing service\nsector,” Chicago Fed Letter, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, March, No. 477.

Goolsbee\n\nFourth Annual Exploring\nCareer Pathways in Economics\nand Related Fields Conference\nChicago, IL\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fOpenining Remarks\nAustan D. Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nGood morning. I’m Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the fourth annual Exploring Career Pathways\nconference.\n\nLet me start by extending my deep thanks to our friends and colleagues at the Sadie\n\nCollective for pioneering this event and partnering with us to create a fantastic program.\nWe are very excited that for the first time since we launched our partnership with the\nSadie Collective, this event is fully in-person. We hope that being together like this\n\nwill allow you to meet new people and draw fresh inspiration as you contemplate your\n\nfutures. And if you were at the networking breakfast this morning, you may have already\nstarted making connections.\n\nThe Chicago Fed is proud to cosponsor today’s event. It represents a truly collaborative\n\neffort intended to provide opportunities to—as the conference title says—explore career\npathways in economics and related professions. We support diversity in economics and\nwant to see you thrive in these important fields.\n\nThis conference has quickly become the cornerstone of the Chicago Fed–Sadie Collective\n\npartnership. The Chicago Fed has also recruited Sadie Collective Fellows into our summer\ninternship program for the past three years, and we plan to continue this practice. So, if\nyou’re a college junior, please consider applying soon to join us next summer.\n\n2\n\n\fIf you are interested in the internship process, I recommend that you connect with Dawn\nCox or Thomas Klier from our team. And not incidentally, I want to thank Dawn and\nThomas for doing such a good job coordinating our internship and research assistant\nprograms and helping to manage the Sadie Collective partnership.\n\nThe Chicago Fed is dedicated to this work because diversity, equity, and inclusion is\n\nvital not just for our Bank, but also for the broader field of economics. For too long,\n\nmany extremely talented women, people of color, and first-generation students have been\ndiscouraged from choosing the field.\n\nBy committing to the recruitment, mentoring, and development of future economists\n\nfrom diverse backgrounds, we can create a better community within the Federal Reserve,\ncontribute to the economics profession overall, and also raise our level of excellence.\n\nOur longstanding emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion ensures that these principles\nare embedded throughout our organization. We recognized early on that we do a better\n\njob of delivering on all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission when our work reflects a\ndiversity of backgrounds and experiences and when we reflect the District we represent.\nWe also work with 16 external partners and community groups, including the Sadie\n\nCollective, that support our efforts to broaden our talent pipelines. These partners help us\nbuild and sustain an equitable, inclusive workplace.\n\nThat brings me back to today’s conference program.

Goolsbee\n\nFed Listens: Joining the Labor\nForce After Covid – A Discussion\non Youth Employment\nChicago, IL\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fOpening Remarks\nAustan D. Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nGood afternoon. I am Austan Goolsbee, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago. It is my pleasure to welcome those of you in the room and those of you at-\n\ntending virtually to this Fed Listens event: Joining the Labor Force After Covid—A Discussion\non Youth Employment.\n\nI am excited to have Governor Michelle Bowman and our fine panelists joining me here\n\ntoday. Since Fed Listens launched in 2019, the Governor has been a passionate leader of\n\nthe program, contributing to sessions like this one across the nation. I have been looking\nforward to the opportunity to welcome Governor Bowman, our panel, and our audience\nto this important conversation.\n\nThe Fed Listens series is a critical opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional\nBanks and the Board of Governors in Washington, to hear directly from the people we\nserve.\n\nMany of you know that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of price stability and\n\nmaximum employment. Our main tool to fulfill that mandate is adjusting interest rates to\nspeed up or slow down the economy. In making such decisions, we examine a wide variety of data. However, data alone do not paint a full picture of our economy.\n\n2\n\n\fSince becoming Chicago Fed president in January, I have traveled to the different states in\nthe Bank’s District to listen, learn, and build a better understanding of the region’s economic successes—and challenges. One of my first trips came in February 2023, when I\nvisited Ivy Tech Community College in northern Indiana.\n\nThe message I delivered that day—one that remains a constant for me—is the importance\nof listening to what we call the “real economy,” that is, talking to people across our Dis-\n\ntrict from all walks of life about how they are experiencing the economy.1 I could not do\n\nmy job without this essential—and unfiltered—real-time, real-life data.\n\nWe are doing that here today through Fed Listens: seeking to hear how monetary policy\naffects people’s daily lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe last time we gathered in person at the Chicago Fed for a Fed Listens event was in\nOctober of 2019.2\n\nIn October 2019, like today, many indicators for the economy as a whole were relatively\n\nhealthy. Notably, the unemployment rate is nearly the same: This past July the reading was\n3.5%, while in October 2019, it was 3.6%. However, in October 2019, we worried that\ninflation was too low! And, of course, we knew nothing of pandemics.\n\nStill, even in a strong labor market overall, many challenges remain. Our conversation\n\nback in 2019 focused on disadvantaged workers’ experiences in the labor market and the\ndifficulties in building wealth in communities where most people have low and moderate\nincomes. These are still relevant topics today.\n\n1\n\nGoolsbee (2023).\n\nDetails for this event are available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/events/2019/fed-listens-monetary-policy-impact-on-workers-and-communities.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\fIn March 2022, we gathered for another Fed Listens session—this time virtually—to talk\nabout a topic similar to today’s: the impact of the pandemic on our young people as they\nexperienced a challenging, frequently disrupted education.3\n\nToday’s conversation sharpens the focus on that critical group of 16- to 24-year-olds.\nThis is the age when so many of our young people are leaving school and home—or\n\nthinking about leaving school and home—and beginning their lives as independent, working adults.\n\nHowever, as we who are parents know, the pandemic changed those plans for many, and\nwe are still assessing its impact and figuring out what to do about it. Our experts here\n\ntoday will provide insight into where we stand currently and shed light on the pathways\nforward.\n\nI thank you for your time and attention.\nAnd now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who, as I mentioned, is a driving force behind Fed Listens. Governor Michelle Bowman has served as a member of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board\n\nin Washington, she served as the state bank commissioner of Kansas—and prior to that as\n\nvice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. Since joining the Fed, I have learned\na great deal from Governor Bowman and am grateful for her deep commitment to Fed\nListens. I am so pleased to welcome her again to Chicago, and I invite her to say a few\nwords before the conversation starts. Governor Bowman.\n\n3\n\nDetails for this event are available online, https://www.chicagofed.org/events/2022/fedlistens.\n\n4\n\n\fReferences\nGoolsbee, Austan D., 2023, “The need for a ground-level view of the economy?,” speech, Ivy Tech\nCommunity College, Elkhart County Campus, Goshen, IN, February 28, available online, https://\nwww.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2023/february-28-ivy-tech-community-college.\n\n5\n\n\f"

How much does the job market have\nto slow to bring in�ation under control? Or does it have to slow?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: You saw at the same time some prominent folks started saying, look\nthe Beveridge curve has shifted out, and we're going to have to have a dramatic increase in\nthe unemployment rate to see any progress basically within weeks� We've had job openings\ncoming down in a straight line and kind of in that space getting back on the curve� So that's\nthat part's, at least encouraging� I think, and the Atlanta Fed's Chicago Fed has done some\nresearch�\nAtlanta Fed independently did some research� And they both tapped into an older literature\nthat it's worth remembering historically, prices are more �exible, and wages stickier than\nprices are� So that means when a shock hits, prices move �rst, and then wages move� And\nthat means that the observed in this observation of the world that wages are not a leading\nindicator for price in�ation, that prices move �rst�\nIt puts the puzzle to the overheated labor market worldview is why did the real wage go\ndown? There's never been a time in US history when the unemployment rate was 4% or less,\nand real wages weren't booming� And so the fact that real wages were going down is at least\na bit of a weird puzzle to just characterizing it as an overheated labor market as the center of\nwhat's happening� And I think of this dynamics point as being you had a shock hit�\nAnd not unlike lightning and thunder, it's the same event� It's just when you detect it is\ndi�erent from when you see the lightning and when you hear the thunder� Prices went up,\nwages did not� That's the real wage going down� Business margin increased� And now, the\nexpectation would be the wages will catch back up� And the business margin would kind of\nshrink�\nSo I think whether you take vacancies to unemployment rates ratios coming down still high,\nbut clearly going the right direction, I think there is at least the chance that you can try to\nget rid of in�ation without creating a recession� And that's the lodestar, whatever you want\nto think of it�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So I'll say it a di�erent way, but I come to much the same conclusion�\nWhen we talk to businesses, we ask a lot of questions, but two questions we ask� One is are\nyou looking to lay anybody o�? And by and large, throughout the entire pandemic, nobody's\nbeen looking to do that� The demand has been so robust that the business leaders have seen\nopportunities to meet that demand by increasing their capacity, and workers want to do that,\na way to do that�\nAnd then the second is, what are you going to do with your wages? Compared to how much\nyou increase wages last year, what are you going to do this year? And one of the things that\nwe hear, actually almost universally is that last year was a catch year� In�ation popped up\nvery fast� It rose quickly� Their employees knew it, they saw it� They felt they're falling\nbehind�\nAnd if there was going to be discontent that could possibly occur because they weren't being\nresponsive to a reality that was going to be hard for them to retain so that everybody wanted\nto catch up get there, make sure that their employees are feeling whole� Now, they didn't\n\n\ffully catch up in 2022� So this year, they, also, and I should say in the catch up, the catch up\nhappened incrementally so they did a raise early in the year�\nMost of the businesses we talked to did a second raise at some point through the year\nbecause they were just really kind of calibrating discovering how much in�ation was going\nup� This year, they're doing another raise that higher than the historical but less than what\nthey did last year because they feel like that catch up is starting to happen� And over the\ncourse of this year, because in�ation is falling, a lot of those wage increases will wind up\nbeing higher than the rate of in�ation�\nAnd so you'll start to see that catch up happen and play out in a pretty signi�cant way� All\nthe business leaders we talked to also say we're on the pathway back to our usual wage\nincrements, that there's con�dence that our policies are going to work� And they understand\nthat it's going to take some time, and they're good with that� I actually think, you mentioned\nthe waggle and all that kind of stu�� I think that we should just all remember that in many\nways, this is still a pandemic economy�\nAnd the things that we're dealing with are a byproduct of policy decisions, of business\ndecisions, of the experiences we had through the pandemic where a lot of people were home\nworking but still getting paid� And the dynamic that we have today is really idiosyncratic�\nAnd it means that we have strength in parts of the economy that you don't usually have\nwhen we're at this part of a policy cycle�\nAnd that that's for me, one of the reasons why I have some con�dence that the immaculate\nreception, if you will, actually take place and that we can see in�ation get back to our target\nwithout having sort of the typically large level of disruption and pain�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Jenna's is from Pittsburgh� So they had at immaculate for their\nimmaculate reception�\n�LAUGHTER�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Now, I'm going to ruin my reputation by following up on that\npessimistically and asking what if what if you're wrong? What if we don't get this immaculate\ndisin�ation? And we do see a situation where we get to the end of the year, and in�ation is\nstill a little sticky, and unemployment's rising pretty sharply� What do you do from a policy\nstandpoint?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I mean, what you do� If they come in at the beginning of this year,\nwe had a couple of months in the fall of last year, things seem to be on a path that it was\nthere was cooling, prices are coming down� And then we had a period where the jobs\nnumbers were surprisingly big, and the growth numbers looked bigger than what we\nanticipated, and prices started to come back up� And we meet every six weeks�\nAnd if the data come in, and over the course of this year, it's clear that the job is not done,\nthen it feels like the policy response is obvious� And likewise, if there's some overshooting,\nand we start going into recession, or there is �nancial crisis, there are known playbooks as\nwell� So I don't think it's the Fed's ability to operate and adjust according to the data is far\nmore nimble than is �scal policy than our almost anybody else's actions� So that part doesn't\nmake me as nervous as though�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So I'm a little more nervous than you are, not because I think your\nanswer is wrong, but the time when that question is called is going to be an uncomfortable\none�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Oh sure�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: And there's going to be tension and pressure and stress from coming\nfrom a lot of di�erent circles� And we are collectively going to have to remember your\nanswer and be willing to be resolute and just hold the course, trust in our strategy and not\nlose sight of what our priorities are� And the world moves in funny ways, and they try to pull\nyou places�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: This has been like my I don't what movie, but it was rough� We were\nfriends before� And so he's been my oracle� What am I? Am I allowed to say can I say that if\nhe likes you, you don't want to say that what�\n\n\f�LAUGHTER�\nJENNA SMIALEK: What don't you want to say?\n�LAUGHTER�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I think that's true� But I said before, and I believe it� And with\nno o�ense to the US Senate, I think now this, the FOMC is the world's greatest deliberative\nbody� It is not to say something went wrong for the Senate, but I kind of think the Senate's\ntime is that has passed� People take very seriously at the FOMC, it's a committee� There are a\nlot of di�erent views� And I think that maybe I'm naive� I've only been to three of them�\nBut I think we can do that� I think there will be disagreements, but�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: We can do it� But the pressure will be enormous�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: And I think that I've tried to tell folks in my building, we haven't gotten\nto the hard part yet�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I see�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: There are going to be these days and these months where you're going\nto see headlines on The New York Times and The Washington Post� You're going to hear\npeople on Bloomberg and CNBC saying what is the Fed doing there? The world is ending�\nAnd we're going to have to be super strong and detached and not get caught up in the\nemotion� I think it's going to be hard� So I remember when I started in this job, and I used to\nbe �ying places on Delta� And they all have the TV that you have� And I started putting on\nCNBC for my �ights� And I'd have to stop�\nBecause they're like the Fed is a bunch of idiots� They what they're doing� And I'm on the\nplane, and I want to start yelling like what's wrong with you? I was like, I better turn this o�\nright now� And it will be worse than that when we get to that potential turning point, people\nare going to want this just to be over� And we have to be sure that when we get to that point,\nthat in�ation is really down, and there's not a question in that anymore�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: My great mentor and dear friend was Paul Volcker� And I worked\nwith him through the �nancial crisis� And I would ask him a lot about the Volcker era� And\nafter he passed away, his widow gave me the original two by four that he kept, and it's\nwritten on that, too� I have it in my o�ce at the Fed� It says please lower these outrageous\ninterest rates� And they would send him keys from cars and say you you've ruined the\neconomy�\nSo the pressure will be high� It's also worth remembering even in that episode, core in�ation\nI think, was over 4% when they stopped� So it wasn't-- they got on a trajectory, but you don't\nland the plane nose down� When you come in for the landing, you've got to soften the blow a\nlittle�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Yeah, that actually raises an interesting point, which is you said that\nthere's an established playbook for how you do this stu� but� I think that one thing I've never\nreally understood about the playbook is in an instance like this where you have high\nin�ation, is high in�ation the sort of be all end all thing you have to focus on? If\nunemployment is shooting up, is there some amount of trying to balance that against the\nhigh in�ation? Or is in�ation really the goal until in�ation is coming down?\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So let's be clear� We have a dual mandate�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: That was like two� I was going to say we have two things�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: No one should misunderstand that� But when I started in this job, if\npeople asked sort of what would be your success in the two parts of the mandate, it was 2%\nin�ation� And then for unemployment, it was 4�4%� That was what people thought the\nnatural rate was four or �ve years ago� We're at 3�4%� So no matter where you think it is, by\nmost objective measures, we are going so far beyond success in terms of the maximum\nemployment mandate that pulling o� of that will probably, can make an argument that brings\nus closer to what most people think are actual target should be�\n\n\fSo a little bit of pulling back in terms of unemployment in the purpose or to the purpose of\ngetting in�ation back to the target, I think is totally justi�able and an appropriate thing to\ndo�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: And the only thought and not to be Darth Vader to Obi Wan Kenobi\nor something, but the only thing that I will add to that is the �ne tuning is not always easy\non the labor market side, of course, that when historically when the unemployment rate goes\nup it doesn't go up a little bit� Ah, let's get from 3�4 to 4�2� The fear would be recession,\nthings spiral, and the unemployment rate goes way up�\nYou said, the balance, and I think it's that� It's try to get the balance� And as President Bostic\nhas emphasized, we're doing very well on the job market side, and we're making progress on\nthe in�ation side� But it's still well above where we want to be� So everything has moved\nthe-- emphasized that side of the mandate� And 500 basis points in one year is a great deal�\nAnd you've seen that through the other panels� That plays its way out in a lot of parts�\nAnd I still think maybe the majority of the tightening impact of what the Fed already did is\nstill to come� And then you add the main stresses on top of it� And that's kind of like �scal\n�nancial condition tightening that we got to take into account�\nJENNA SMIALEK: How are you thinking about the bank stresses as you set policy?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I think of it, there's two ways� One view is I call �nancial dominance,\nwhich says if there's a chance of a �nancial crisis, you should kind of subordinate the\nmonetary policy goals� I'm not a fan of that� And I and I fear that it's drifts a little closer to\nthe Fed should only do whatever the �nancial markets expect or want them to do� And I'm\nnot a fan of that as the Fed strategy�\nBut I think if you look at past credit stresses, they reduce GDP in a pretty signi�cant way�\nAnd if something's going to land on GDP, we should take that into account when we're doing\nthe monetary policy� So in a way, it's doing some of the work of monetary policy for us� And\nunlike other conditions of �nancial stress, this one's happening where the �nancial stability\ngoals and the monetary policy goals are not �ghting each other�\nWe're trying to cool o� the prices� And if banks raise their lending standards and conserve\ncapital, and that slows the overheating in some sectors in a way that helps us�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Yeah, I talk about this a little di�erently in the sense that I don't that we\nhave a crisis right now in �nancial markets� We have a small number of institutions that had\nrisk management strategies that work less well than you would like� And the markets have\nmade a judgment� And what has happened, though, is that that judgment hasn't led to a\nsimilar judgment for a large number of other institutions�\nAnd so we've not seen this contagion take place� And what we've seen instead is every leader\nof a bank has basically said, OK, there is this potential liquidity risk problem� So let me\nconserve a little of my capital and not lend as much� That is the realization or the revelation\nof credit tightening� That's what monetary policy tightening is supposed to generate� And so\nthe question that we all need to ask, and there's a lot of conversation on this is has the\ntightening been outsized relative to what we would have expected for the amount of\ntightening that policy happened?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yes�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: And I don't the answer to that question� And I think what we're going\nto �nd out over the next several months is how much further the tightening goes, and how\nmuch does that tightening then bind economic activity, which will then �ow through to the\nin�ation performance over the next several months? I've been honestly, I expected that the\nturbulence from Silicon Valley Bank and Signature and First Republic was going to cause a\nlot more panic by bankers as well as depositors�\nAnd in the sixth district, that just hasn't happened� It's been quite remarkable how people\nhave just taken it on board and said, OK, that's one case� I don't think that's my case� So I'm\njust going to keep doing what I do� And so we're getting sort of a more orderly tightening of\n�nancial conditions than I might have expected, given how this all started�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I agree with that� Seventh district, you saw the same thing� And going\ninto the last FOMC meeting, I expected to see more of them� And I talked to people that\n\n\fthey would be like, oh, we're pulling all our money out of regional banks, or we're doing\nwhatever� And the thing that we heard over and over was basically the interest rate is way up\nyou� And there is a tightening that comes from the interest rate� But we have yet to really see\nthat shoe drop, I think�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Speaking of shoes dropping, � I wonder what you each expect to be the\nsort of economic fallout if we don't come to some sort of debt limit agreement�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Oh my God�\nJENNA SMIALEK: It seems like�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Oh, God�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Yeah so�\nJENNA SMIALEK: An operative big, big news story today�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Yeah, on a very basic level, it is I can't believe we're actually having to\nhave this conversation� Because the consequences are just substantial� When I think about the\nUnited States' position in the world as a �nancial leader, part of it is about con�dence, and\nthe notion that when we commit to do something, we actually do it� And if you start to\nundermine that, then you stop getting the bene�t of the doubt� And then you wind up having\nto pay more to do pretty much anything you want to do�\nAnd that winds up being a tax on everybody� And everything that we're trying to do, and I\nthink it also has the potential to threaten our position with the �at currency� We have our\ncurrency be the currency of the world� If the US has gotten crazy, then maybe we need to\ndiversify strategies in ways that could also hurt us� I'd rather just not have any of these ideas\neven be contemplated by the business sector� And so I'm hopeful that this gets handled pretty\nquickly�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I mean, it couldn't come at a worse time in the sense that we already\nhave this �nancial stresses and the arguments about what securities they have and the\ncollateral� And treasuries is the safest thing there is� And now, we're going to go blow that\nup� That would just be a mess� At the end of the day, I kind of still can't believe that, or we're\nnot going to pay the military, or they're not going to pay Social Security, or� It just doesn't\nmake sense to me�\nAnd I'm hoping that this is more like when you watch the NBA, there are people who don't\nlike to watch the NBA� Because they're like, oh, what's the point of watching the �rst three\nquarters of the game� It's all going to come down to the last three minutes, and then they're\ngoing to start fouling and shoot free throws� So I'm just not going to pay attention until the\nlast second� And you kind of get a sense that it's like that� But it would be very problematic�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Have we started shooting free throws yet?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: �LAUGH� Let's hope, let's take some free throws� You what I mean?\nThis one, they can sort it out� As I say, let's do the mature thing and just have a �ght over\nshutting down the government in a way� That's the mature, let's not threaten default�\nJENNA SMIALEK: In the event that we do threaten default, that we don't take the Medicare\n�ght that you're suggesting, does the Fed have e�ective tools to mitigate the fallout?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Compared to what? I mean, that's always the question� This is not a,\nthe reserve banks would not be sorting that out� That's, Washington would have to decide\nwhat those tools are�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Yeah, I don't I don't think it's obvious what we would do� I think we\nwould wind up being in a reactive mode� It would e�ectively cause us to have to adjust what\nour outlook would be for the foreseeable future� Because all relationships would change�\nFinancial markets functioning would change� It would just be totally di�erent and much\nmore di�cult� And maybe embedded in your question is, do we think the Fed is going to be\na white knight to come in and save the day?\nI don't think so� But I haven't been in those conversations� So maybe there is some switch\nyou can �ip, but�\n\n\fAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I'm the new guy� I don't� I have no idea�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Nobody's pointed you towards the switch�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: My thing was I was there in the administration the last time we got\ninto this �ght about the debt ceiling� And we got downgraded, but that was actually two\nhours after I left the government� That was the day I left� So we can't tell� Either it was the\ndebt ceiling �ght, or it was me leaving the government� But what would the rating agencies\nreaction be? I would fear besides the �rst order craziness, there's second order craziness, too�\nIf you get two of the three major rating agencies downgrade something then there a bunch\nof �nancial institutions that can't hold those securities, so then it's like what would that be\nTreasury? Everyone would be forced, and would the rating agencies peg other ratings to\nthose ratings? I don't know� I think that we're going to sort it out� However they negotiate,\nor whatever they do, as Chair Powell said, there really isn't any alternative� They're going to\nhave to raise the debt ceiling�\nThe only question is, how much pain are we going to have before that happens?\nJENNA SMIALEK: I like that you just set up if you resign, we should all watch it as a\nbearish�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: If I resign? Oh geez,\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: You're not going anywhere� You are going nowhere�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Switching to audience questions, our most upvoted question is markets\nare pricing nearly a 75 basis point reversal in rates� There's a disconnect between Fed\nrhetoric and markets� How do you reconcile this?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I'd just give you one caution� Go read the Bar report on Silicon\nValley Bank, and you will see that there was a moment where Silicon Valley Bank had\ninterest rate hedges in place� And they removed the interest rate hedges, and just took naked\nbets� And the reason they did that was they looked, and they said but the Fed said it's going\nto keep the rates high� And the market says, no, they won't keep the rates high� And it did\nnot end well for the people that were betting against the Fed� I'll just leave it at that�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: I really I must add on that�\n�LAUGHTER�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: I mean, what-- I am now, of course� Look, I think part of this is a\ndi�erent projection about how fast in�ation can come down� And I just don't think it's going\nto come down that fast� And in order to reduce rates by that much, it'd have to come down a\nlot a lot� I just don't see it� I'd be happy to be wrong on this� Because then it means we're to\nthe other side� But I don't, it's not�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I mean, it kind of feels like there's two components� One could be if\nthe market is more pessimistic about how the economy is going to do, and there have been\npoints like that where if you looked at their implied GDP growth, they were saying it was\ngoing to be a bigger recession than what the SEP thought or what the FOMC participants\nthought� That, I kind of understand how they would have those di�erences�\nAnd then the other component is the, well, they don't think perhaps that the Fed will commit\nto getting rid of in�ation or stick to it� And that's the part� Just go look at the Bar report�\nThat's a dangerous way to bet�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Another easy one, given concern about bank deposits declining and\npressuring bank balance sheets, would it be worth revisiting the pace of balance sheet run o�\ngiven part of the decline in deposits already underway was likely due to the stoma shrinking?\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Go ahead�\nJENNA SMIALEK: �LAUGH�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So I've been kind of surprised and pleasantly so how the reduction of\nthe balance sheet has not led to widespread disruption in �nancial markets and money\nmarkets� And I actually think that what we're seeing in the reverse repo market suggests that\nthere's still a fair amount of excess in the space that should allow us to cancel excess reserves,\n\n\fright, to allow us to continue� The balance sheet is an important, I guess, in the background,\nbut it is a real thing�\nAnd our presence in these markets is real� And until we get to a more rationalized space, I\nthink I'm always going to be wondering, are we creating too large a distortion so that capital\nis not �owing to the places that it should in an appropriate way� I think we always have to be\ntaking that question seriously� And we have to be really committed to returning our presence\nto a small level as it possibly can�\nNow, it will not be what it was before� There are a lot of dynamics in the marketplace that\nsuggests that our balance sheets should be larger, demand for cash is a lot higher� There's a\nlot of other stu�, GDP is larger� The US economy is larger� But it's larger now than it needs\nto be� And the one thing I say a lot is that you do emergency things in emergency times� But\nwhen the emergency is passed, you should stop doing the emergency things�\nAnd so we need to be thinking hard about given where things have evolved sort of what is\nthe non stopping emergency thing look like? What is that threshold level of balance sheet\nthat is the equivalent of that? And we should try to get there as intensively or attentively as\npossible�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: It seems like President Logan at Dallas has done a lot of deep\nthinking about this, has a ton of experience� And I like the thinking of the ONRP as a type of\nreserves, and we've got a lot of reserves� Our view of what the target should be, it does limit,\nnot limit, but it does in�uence our action�\nAnd I guess the only thing I would add to the philosophical spirit that Raphael had there is I\ndo think the bar, we want the bar to be a little high on changing the strategy on QT or QE\nthat we don't want the world to think that every time there is an FOMC meeting, we're\ngoing to go in and decide this plus the Fed funds rate that outlining a strategy in a way it's\nkind of a rule based thing� And if there's a major disruption we could change the speed at\nwhich we're doing that�\nBut barring a major disruption, there's something to be said of everybody understands the\nspeed at which we're going to be doing quantitative tightening� And so it means something if\nwe change that�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: The second thing on this is just like you talking about a �nancial\nweakness working in the same direction, the reduction of the balance sheet is also working\nin the same direction, right? So we don't have policy incongruence� And if it can be in the\nbackground, it's very passive� We're not actually actively trying to manage this I think it\nallows us to have some success without causing people to wonder like you got six di�erent\nmoving parts, how do I add all this up to something to be able to build my own strategy as a\nbusiness�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Interesting� So we've got two more questions that I want to ask, so brief\nanswers�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: I've got to be quick�\nJENNA SMIALEK: I want to make sure we get to-RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Talking so long�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I told you she was giving us the body language� It was like beat, but\nwe weren't accepting it� So now she just told us be shorter, �ne �ne� We can do that�\nJENNA SMIALEK: Mervyn King criticized central bankers for relying on models, which\ncharacterized as saying that in�ation will return to 2% because everyone expects 2% because\ncentral bankers are targeting 2%� How do you think about forecasting in�ation?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: I wasn't there� That was a critique of President Bostic, and-�LAUGHTER�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So I actually think it was a mischaracterization of what we do� � The\nmodel is an approximation of reality but then, you have to let reality inform where you take\nthat approximation� And we do a lot in our bank to get input from real people in real time�\nAnd that allows us to have a narrative that guides where I take the model of prediction and\n\n\fhow I adjust it to get an outlook� So I think pre-Great Financial Crisis, that was a much\nmore legitimate critique�\nBut the Fed missed that one pretty bad� And in our bank and others, we decided we need to\nget a whole new set of places to collect information from� So we have a regional economic\ninformation network� We built up a whole survey shop� We put up a lot of tools on the web\nfor people to see all the di�erent ways you can look at this� And I think it's really helped�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: One of the �rst pieces of advice Raphael gave me was get out and go\ntalk to people� Go in your district� You want to meet the businesses, meet the bankers, get\nhere some things that are not just coming from the Ferbis model� And in a way, if you're too\nbelieving of the model, the Ferbis model is heavily driven by expectations� So if expectations\ndon't move that much, it's going to predict in�ation will come back down quickly�\nIt is poor, and I'll never say the word transitory out loud� But that can give play into that\nproblem�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: I should have had my jar here�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah� �LAUGH� So I think in spirit, the King critique�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: It's time my language�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: 50 Seconds� The King critique, I think he's right� But � I think it was\nunfair to say that we just look at models in that way\nJENNA SMIALEK: OK, �nal question, if you don't raise rates in June, would you\ncharacterize it as a pause or a skip?\n�LAUGHTER�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: Wow�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Is it a pause or a skip? I mean, doesn't it depend on what the data? I\nmean, it totally depends on the data�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So yeah, I'll-JENNA SMIALEK: That's Always the right answer, right?\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: But it's like�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: I'll play the game, though� Yeah,\n�LAUGHTER�\nI'll say pause� But a pause could be a skip�\n�LAUGHTER�\nOr it could be a hold� And so-AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Or it could be a hold�\nRAPHAEL BOSTIC: So to me, I think we don't know� There's a lot of uncertainty in the\nworld� And so we'll just have to see how things play out and get a sense of what's true signal\nversus what's noise� And that's going to be a week to week thing� And so�\nJENNA SMIALEK: So we can look forward to that hopscotch for the next one�\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Scotch�\n�LAUGHTER�\nJENNA SMIALEK: All right, and look at that, 30 seconds to spare� We kept it right on time�\nThank you both so much� It's been a great talk� Thanks to the organizers�\n\n\f"

            "content": "Monetary Policy in\nMoments of Financial\nUncertainty\nAustan D. Goolsbee\n\nEconomic Club of Chicago\nForum Luncheon\nChicago, IL\nApril 11, 2023\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fMonetary Policy in Moments of\nFinancial Uncertainty\nAustan D. Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nIntroduction\nThank you, David, for your kind introduction. I’m happy to be back with you.\nSeems like some things never change. Chicago’s ten days of spring have begun. The\nEconomic Club of Chicago is meeting to discuss the issues of the day. The Cubs and\nSox both had their home openers, and if the playoffs started today, they would both\nalready be eliminated.\nSome things are new, though. I became president of the Chicago Fed in January. It’s\nbeen quite an experience. In this short time on the job, I’ve already voted to increase the\nfederal funds rate two times. My predecessor, Charlie Evans, it took him more than eight\nyears to do that!\nOf course, the environment is much different now than it was back then. That’s why\nthe first thing I’ve been doing as Chicago Fed president is traveling around our District\nto hear directly from people and businesses and community organizations about the\neconomy. Our District covers the heart of the Midwest—all of Iowa and most of Illinois,\nIndiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin1—and I’ve heard from a lot of people in these places.\nTurns out, folks have some pretty strong opinions about the Fed these days.\n\n1\n\nFurther details on the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which is served by the Chicago Fed, are available online,\n\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/region/region.\n\n2\n\n\fSpeaking of opinions, this is the point where I officially need to say that the views I am\nexpressing are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nSummary\nThe law assigns the Fed two monetary policy goals: maximum employment and stable\nprices. When inflation gets too high, as it has been lately, the Fed fights it with the main\ntool it has—cooling the economy through tighter financial conditions. That’s why the Fed\nhas increased the federal funds rate so aggressively—almost 5 full percentage points\nover the past year.\nIt takes time for policy moves to work their way through the economy, and it’s hard to\nknow how long that might take and how much is enough. So that’s why we say that\ncentral banks need to be “data dependent”—to watch how things go and adjust\npolicy accordingly.\nWell, the data in late 2022 and early 2023 were surprisingly strong. Spending held up;\njob growth was remarkable. Inflation did not come down enough. Based on these data\nalone, you would think the Fed would be pushing more aggressive policy moves than\nwe were a few months ago.\nBut if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) made by the Federal\nReserve Governors and Reserve Bank presidents in mid-March,2 the expectations of\nwhere rates are headed for the rest of this year moved only slightly from the previous\nprojections made in December,3 and many private sector estimates have them\ngoing down.\n\n2\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2023). The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections presents FOMC\n\nparticipants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three to four years and for the longer run.\n3\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2022).\n\n3\n\n\fOf course, that’s because these latest projections include an early assessment of the\nnew big hairy elephant in the room—the fact that two significant banks failed in a hightech version of an old-fashioned bank run and triggered broader financial market turmoil.\nTo restore calm, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Treasury, and the Fed\nstepped in to guarantee all deposits at these banks, not just those below the FDIC cap,\nand also created a new lending facility and enhanced the existing discount window—\nall to help prevent further runs on the system.4\nToday, I want to explain why I think that at moments like this, of financial stress, the right\nmonetary approach calls for prudence and patience—for assessing the potential impact\nof financial stress on the real economy.\nI don’t say that because I believe we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation if\nmarkets get upset. That’s a perspective I call “financial dominance”—that financial\nissues should dominate monetary policy concerns. Some people believe that should\ndrive Fed actions. I absolutely do not. Congress gave us a job: maximize employment\nand stabilize prices. They didn’t say to always keep financial markets happy or make\nsure investors don’t lose any money.\nThe reason to include financial conditions in our monetary policy discussion is that\nhistory has taught us that moments of financial stress, even if they don’t escalate into\ncrises, can mean tighter credit conditions. These can have a material impact on the real\neconomy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when\nsetting policy.\n\n4\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023).\n\n4\n\n\fNow, in today’s environment, there is no conflict between our current monetary policy\nand these tighter credit conditions, especially if they are part of strengthening the\nfinancial system; they can work in tandem to help cool inflation. But we also have to\nrecognize that this combination could hit some sectors or regions in a way that looks\ndifferent than if monetary policy was acting on its own.\nPotential credit crunch has real implications\nIf you are old enough to remember 2008—a few of you in this room look like you may\nbe—or if you are a student of financial history, you know that when stress turns into a\nfull-blown financial crisis, the entire economy—workers, businesses, and consumers—\nall suffer immense harm. So, in crises, central bankers and other policymakers act\nquickly to provide substantial support to the economy. Sidenote: Moments of financial\nstress are a particularly bad time to take actions that could ignite a financial crisis on\ntheir own like, say, defaulting on U.S. Treasuries in a fight over the debt limit.\nBut even financial stress that doesn’t spiral into a crisis can still lead to a pullback in\ncredit and have a material impact on the real economy. The research is full of studies\nshowing this across countries and across time. In U.S. history, think of the fallout from\nthe savings and loan restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s. It didn’t spiral into a systemic\ncrisis, but it made the 1990–91 recession worse and significantly slowed gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth in the subsequent recovery.\nNow, these historical episodes may not be perfectly analogous to what’s happening\ntoday. First of all, the banking situation and related market turmoil have quieted over the\npast couple of weeks. Second, our financial system today is less reliant on bank credit\nthan most other countries are or than the U.S. itself was 30 years ago.\n\n5\n\n\fStill, we need to be on watch for the real possibility of tighter credit conditions. Notably,\nbanks could pull back on lending in order to protect their balance sheets. Indeed, the\nFed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey seemed to indicate tightening lending standards\neven before the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures.5\nAccounting for potential headwinds and today’s data dependence\nIf they develop, the Fed would need to account for these potential headwinds when\nsetting monetary policy. In some ways, it’s almost mechanical; we’ve been tightening\nfinancial conditions to bring inflation down, so if the response to recent banking\nproblems leads to financial tightening, monetary policy has to do less.\nIt’s not clear by how much less, but private sector analysts have speculated that it might\namount to raising the funds rate by something in the range of 25 to 75 basis points. We\nneed to get a handle on the size of the financial headwinds, and that’s why we need to\nmonitor a wide variety of financial indicators. This is just today’s funkier version of the\nold “data dependence” moniker.\nOut here in the Reserve Banks, we’ll also talk to a lot of people. Hearing what households,\nbusinesses, and community groups are experiencing can reveal things that haven’t yet\nshown up in the formal data, which get released with some significant lags.\nGiven how uncertainty abounds about where these financial headwinds are going,\nI think we need to be cautious. We should gather further data and be careful about raising\nrates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in\ngetting down inflation.\n\n5\n\nFurther details about the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Banking Lending Practices\n\nare available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm.\n\n6\n\n\fSupervisory tools as the first line of defense\nThere is a branch of the financial dominance school of thought that takes the argument\neven further. They argue that if there’s a chance of significant financial stress, we should\npreemptively cut rates to reduce the odds of it.\nI think we should be careful with that logic, though, given our trouble getting inflation\ndown in recent years—not to mention the dangers of setting a precedent for giving in\nany time the market throws a tantrum. The principal defense for avoiding or mitigating\nfinancial stress should be supervisory and regulatory tools that are aimed at ensuring\nthe safety and soundness of both individual institutions and the financial system more\nbroadly. These tools include capital and liquidity requirements, stress testing, and our\nsupervision process that examines institutions’ portfolios and risk management practices.\nPressing on these dimensions to strengthen the financial system can help it weather\nstress events like these recent bank failures.\nAnd it’s worth noting that our situation today is significantly better because of the reforms\nput in place after the Great Financial Crisis—particularly the higher capital and liquidity\nbuffers required of our largest financial institutions.\nUnusual circumstances\nIt is also worth noting a couple of ways that the impact of credit conditions and monetary\npolicy today may look different from normal.\nFirst, the economy is still coming back from the bizarre Covid times. Initially, people\nspent more time at home, and we saw a huge surge in demand for Pelotons and durable\ngoods and a plunge in demand for services like travel or going to the dentist. More\nrecently, consumption is shifting back toward such services, and that has been reflected\nin the inflation data, with goods inflation coming way down but services inflation—\n\n7\n\n\fespecially for categories where spending is very discretionary like travel, hotels, restaurants, and recreation—proving particularly persistent. With the service sector generally\nbeing less interest rate sensitive, it might take longer to reduce inflation here, though it\nwill moderate as tighter financial conditions take the heat off of the economy in general.\nSecond, today we do not face a common problem found in many earlier times of financial\nstress: Our financial stability goals and our monetary policy goals do not conflict.\nOften, moments of financial stress happen when the macroeconomy is struggling. The\nkinds of actions that financial institutions need to take—or that the Fed or other regulators\nrequire them to take—like tightening lending standards or conserving and raising capital\nmay strengthen the banking sector, but also reduce the availability of credit when the\neconomy cannot afford to get slowed down.\nAt present, we do not face this dilemma. Actions that strengthen the banking sector’s\nfinancial position and reduce the likelihood of additional financial problems currently\nmake the job of monetary policy easier—they tighten credit and help bring inflation down.\nThis brings me to the last point I want to make today. The impact of credit conditions\nand monetary policy now may look a bit different than during historical tightening cycles.\nMuch of the recent financial turmoil has seemed to be concentrated in the regional bank\nsector. If a potential credit crunch were concentrated there, it would mean that sectors\nand areas that are particularly exposed to these institutions would feel the impact of\ntighter conditions more acutely. These institutions are a particularly important source of\ncredit card and midsize business funding, as well as lenders for commercial real estate\nand autos. Different parts of the country are more reliant than others on these regional\nbanks as well.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nAt the end of the day, the best central bankers are data dependent and the Fed’s job is\nto be more paranoid than anyone else. In lucky times we might not need to follow too\nmany data series to decide where inflation, unemployment, and GDP are headed. In\nunluckier, more interesting times like the one we are in right now, with wild shocks\nincluding a pandemic and wars and cryptocurrencies and financial stress, it means\ndigging into loads of new information to glean where the economy is headed in order\nto set appropriate monetary policy.\nThe Fed must use everything in its toolkit to maximize employment and stabilize prices.\nSure, it’s harder in an unpredictable world full of pandemics and digital currencies and\nsocial-media-fueled bank runs. But we will do it. We’re from Chicago. We get the job\ndone no matter what the conditions. There is no bad weather, only bad clothing.\nSo remember: Financial stresses come and go. The Fed’s mandate is forever.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2023, “Federal Reserve Board\nannounces it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions\nto help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors,” press\nrelease, Washington, DC, March 12, available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/\nnewsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2023, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington,\nDC, March 22, available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/\nfomcprojtabl20230322.pdf.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington,\nDC, December 14, available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/\nfiles/fomcprojtabl20221214.pdf\n\n10\n\n\f"

Goolsbee\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you, Dr. Robinson-Cooper, for that introduction. And thank you to the culinary\nstudents for our fabulous meal and to members of the community for turning out.\nThanks also to the students I got to meet with in the respiratory therapy lab and the\ncommunication, entrepreneurship, and business administration programs. What an\nimpressive group!\nAnd let me give a special thanks to Chris Murphy for his help in setting up this visit to\nIvy Tech as well as the tour of the operations at Jayco this morning. Chris is on the\nboard of directors of the Chicago Fed and a mainstay of the community here in\nthe region.\nNow, I know perfectly well that some of you are only here because your instructor told\nyou to come. I used to hate stuff like that when I was a student, so I will try not to\noverstay my welcome. I am going to tell you about who we are and why I came here to\nNortheast Indiana for my very first speech as president of the Chicago Fed.\nLet me get the required part out up front: These are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of others on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal\nReserve System.\nIf you came here wondering about the Fed’s role, you aren’t alone. In recent polling, a\nbig majority of Americans say they have heard of the Fed, but they don’t know what it\n2\n\n\fdoes. 1 But that hasn’t stopped folks from judging how we are doing. A recent Gallup poll\nsays that only 37 percent think the Fed is doing a good job—just 3 points better than\nthe IRS. 2\nSince I’ve become president, lots of folks have told me why: Some people are upset\nabout inflation outstripping their wages, some about all the disruptions caused by the\npandemic and the supply shortages making it harder for businesses to grow, others\nabout the risk of unemployment creeping up and the danger that the economy might be\nheaded for a recession. Even if they don’t know what, exactly, the Fed does, they know\nthat they want it to fix things that feel broken.\nWho we are\nSo, let’s start with what we do. The Chicago Fed serves the Seventh District. It is your\nlocal branch of the Federal Reserve System. Geographically, our District covers the\nheart of the Midwest—all of Iowa and most of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and\nMichigan. 3 Some people in Northeast Indiana don’t appreciate being lumped together\nwith Michigan; imagine how I felt as a Bears fan when they told me the District includes\nthe Green Bay Packers.\nThe Fed regulates banks in the District. And we serve, basically, as the bank for banks.\nWe wire money. We do direct deposits of your paycheck. If one of our banks needs new\nbills to restock their ATMs, they get them from us. Our vault has billions of dollars of\ncash in it. That doesn’t look as cool as you would think, though. I thought it would be\n\nDiamond and Sawyer (2022).\nJones (2022).\n3\nFurther details on the Seventh Federal Reserve District are available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/region/region.\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n\fstacks and stacks of money piled up to the ceiling. Actually, the money is bound in small\nbundles wrapped in plastic baggies and sitting on pushcarts. It almost looks like a high\nschool storage room or something. Still, if you look at a dollar bill in your wallet and it\nhas a letter “G” displayed in the circle, it’s from us—the Seventh District.\nWe also work on community development and ways to foster economic growth that\nbenefit everyone and ensure a safe and inclusive financial system. We are responsible\nfor enforcing consumer protection laws and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to\nmake sure financial institutions work fairly in their communities. 4 In addition, we work\nwith local partners to promote economic growth in low- and\nmoderate-income communities.\nBut the Fed is most well-known for monetary policy—basically for setting some of the\nfundamental interest rates in the economy to meet the specific goals for us that are\nspecified by law. The Federal Reserve Act requires the Fed to use its monetary policy\ntools to promote maximum employment and stable prices. 5 This is called our “dual\nmandate”—to keep both unemployment and inflation low.\nIf the economy overheats, higher rates can cool it off. If we are in a recession, lower\nrates can heat it up. Generally, there isn’t any tension between what we need to do to\nreach our two objectives. However, sometimes they can conflict with each other. Then\nthe job gets a lot tougher, and we have to think about trade-offs.\n\nDetails on the Community Reinvestment Act are available online,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/cra_about.htm.\n5\nCongress amended the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) in 1977 to provide greater clarity about the goals of monetary\npolicy. More details on the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 are available online,\nhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed-reform-act-of-1977.\n4\n\n4\n\n\fWhy I am here\nOf course, it’s always hard to figure out what’s happening in the economy from the\navalanche of data coming in. One of the toughest things about monetary policy is\nfiguring out what to pay attention to. And that is the main reason I am here in\nNortheast Indiana.\nYou see, most of our economic data come out with a delay—the jobs numbers, the\ninflation numbers, gross domestic product (GDP)—they all come out a week, a month, a\nquarter after they happen. Sometimes these data bounce around a lot or give\ncontradictory signals. It can be hard to get a clear picture of what is going on. So, it’s\nimportant to supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the\nreal economy. This is especially true when things are as strange and up in the air as\nthey have been through much of the pandemic times.\nThe temptation can be to look at what’s easy to find and lean more on that—stock\nmarket, bond market, and other financial data that give instant reactions to news about\nthe economy and our policy announcements and tell us which way the markets want the\nFed to move. But it is a danger and a mistake for policymakers to rely too heavily on\nmarket reactions.\nThe thing is, our job is ultimately judged by what happens in the real economy. We need\nto know how things are going in places like here in Elkhart County. We come here to\nfind out the latest information: How is the job market? The unemployment rate around\nhere has literally been as low as 1.4 percent, but how much has it been rising as the\ndemand for RVs post-pandemic has cooled off? Are supply chain pressures easing for\n\n5\n\n\fthe transmissions plants in Kokomo or for the medical device makers in Warsaw? Are\nwages for middle-class workers keeping up with inflation?\nWe need this kind of information about the real economy. It’s why we do a lot of\noutreach. Each month we survey about 120 business and community leaders\nthroughout the District—many from right around here; we host scores of industrial and\ncommunity roundtables and conferences each year.\nThe best central bankers are ones we call “data dependent.” They decide what to do\nbased on the conditions they see in the economy. They don’t start with an ideology.\nThey start from facts. I came here to learn everything I can from you and to hear about\nhow the economy is doing. This is information we need to watch when we make\ndecisions about policy.\nMonetary policy can’t solve every economic problem. But when the Fed does its job\nwell, it provides a stable environment that makes it easier for you to succeed and helps\nmillions of people achieve their goals.\nConclusion\nNo doubt there will be bumps in the road to come. It’s a strange and unprecedented\nmoment coming out of the pandemic. Lots of things in the economy got turned on their\nheads, and we need to figure out where they will land and what that means for the\nfuture. But we will figure it out. Here in the Midwest, we know how to get the job done no\nmatter what the conditions. We know there is no bad weather, only bad clothing.\n\n6\n\n\fSo thank you for everything you do for this region and this nation, and thank you for\nteaching me about what’s going on here in Northeast Indiana.\nDr. Robinson-Cooper, if they sat through that, they really deserve full extra credit.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\nDiamond, James, and Johnny Sawyer, 2022, \"Few Americans understand the Federal\nReserve’s role outside curbing inflation,\" Ipsos, press release, April 30, available online,\nhttps://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/Axios-Federal-Reserve-2022.\nJones, Jeffrey M., 2022, \"Government agency ratings: CIA, FBI up; Federal Reserve\ndown,\" Gallup, October 5, available online,\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/402464/government-agency-ratings-cia-fbi-federal-reservedown.aspx.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nGood afternoon and welcome to the 36th annual Economic Outlook Symposium (EOS).\nThe EOS is currently the Chicago Fed’s longest-running conference series and has\nbeen held every December since 1987. Prior to the pandemic, the EOS was held in\nperson, with many of you being regular attendees. We are very excited to be hosting\nour first hybrid symposium and are happy to welcome attendees on site for the first time\nsince before the pandemic. Based on registrations, this will be our largest EOS\naudience ever. Over time, our audience has expanded significantly. Our original\nconference was by invitation only and hosted 26 local business economists, including\nCarl Tannenbaum, today’s keynote speaker, who tells us that one of the other\nattendees at that first symposium was the chief economist from Sears. Earlier in-person\nmeetings were limited to the seats available in the auditorium, which was always filled to\ncapacity. With our new hybrid format, we are pleased to be able to welcome participants\nfrom across our District. 1 So, whether you are here with us in Chicago or participating\nremotely, we are really excited to have you join us.\nThis conference has always been an opportunity for us to hear from participants and\npresenters on the state of the economy. Thanks to our presenters today for sharing your\nexpertise with us. A special thanks also to those of you in the audience who contribute\n\nThe Seventh Federal Reserve District, which is served by the Chicago Fed, comprises most of Illinois, Indiana,\nMichigan, Wisconsin, and all of Iowa. Further details about the District are available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/region/region.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\fINTERNAL FR/OFFICIAL USE // FRSONLY\n\nto our advisory councils, roundtables, surveys, and contact calls. The information we\ngather from our contacts on the ground has always been valuable and has been even\nmore essential to our understanding of the rapidly changing economic environment over\nthe past couple of years. To illustrate the importance we place on your input, we have\nworked hard to augment our contact base to include organizations serving households\nwith low and moderate incomes. So many thanks to those of you who bring that\nimportant perspective.\nAfter every symposium, we write a summary of the event and post it on our website. 2\nThese summaries provide an archive of the concerns people have for the coming year,\nand a review of them shows some interesting patterns: We have continually been\nconcerned about the health of the Midwest’s manufacturing base, the labor market,\nconsumer attitudes and expectations, and balance sheets. However, some of the\ncommentary changes over time and reflects where we are in the business cycle. I found\na couple of past summaries particularly notable given some similarities and differences\nbetween the concerns expressed then and those expressed about today’s economic\nenvironment. In 1988 growth was quite robust, and the summary of the outlook for 1989\npointed out that participants were, and I quote, “seeking a soft landing.” It concluded\nthat “the relatively favorable 1989 economy portrayed by the median forecast—with real\nGNP growth at a sustainable pace, little further acceleration of prices, and continued\nexpansion of the nation’s productive capacity—could be just such a soft landing.” 3\nThese EOS summaries are available online, https://www.chicagofed.org/events/eos-series.\nCummins and Schnorbus (1989). GNP stands for gross national product, which is the value of all finished goods\nand services produced by the labor and property of a country’s residents, both at home and abroad. More\ncommonly reported than GNP these days is gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all finished goods\nand services produced within a country’s borders. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis began reporting GDP\nrather than GNP as the primary measure of U.S. production beginning in November 1991.\n2\n3\n\n3\n\n\fINTERNAL FR/OFFICIAL USE // FRSONLY\n\nAbout a decade later, the symposium grappled with the question of where had all the\nworkers gone. The summary of the outlook for 1998 noted that employers were\nstruggling to find job applicants. One of the solutions proposed back then was “bringing\nretirees back into the work force.” 4 With the labor force participation for older workers\ncurrently well below its pre-pandemic rate, this solution is being offered again to help\naddress tight labor markets today. Across many years, EOS participants have remarked\non the inflationary environment and, in particular, how energy prices were influencing\noverall inflation. For example, in late 2014, participants were anticipating inflation to\nremain low in the coming year partly because of low oil prices. 5 As our own senior\nbusiness economist Thom Walstrum will share in a moment, this year's participants are\nanticipating inflation to come down substantially, and I suspect that some of this\nreduction reflects the declines in energy prices from this summer’s highs.\nThis year’s conference has a wonderful combination of speakers—some of them are\nfamiliar faces, while others are new additions. You have a great afternoon ahead of you.\nLong-standing EOS participant Carl Tannenbaum, who is the chief economist for\nNorthern Trust, will be giving a keynote outlook for the whole economy. Then we’ve got\ntwo great panels on important topics. In keeping with past years’ formats, the first panel\nis going to cover the outlook for the manufacturing sector, with a focus on autos and\nheavy machinery. We’ll also hear about freight and logistics—which are always crucial\nbut have added relevance today given the supply chain snarls of the past year. The\nsecond panel is focused more on households. It includes experts who will discuss the\n\n4\n5\n\nStrauss and Motycka (1998).\nStrauss and Berman (2015).\n\n4\n\n\fINTERNAL FR/OFFICIAL USE // FRSONLY\n\nconsumer and labor markets. From a new addition to the program, which is part of the\nsecond panel, we will hear valuable perspectives on the challenges job seekers face\nand the difficulties households are encountering—particularly in regard to maintaining\ntheir health and well-being—as they come out of the pandemic.\nI am now going to turn things over to Thom, who will share the results of last year’s\nforecast competition, as well as this year’s forecast. I find it pretty amazing that we have\nbeen doing that for 36 years!\n\n5\n\n\fINTERNAL FR/OFFICIAL USE // FRSONLY\n\nReferences\nCummins, Philip A., and Robert H.

Doug helped the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nachieve its policy goals as well as make it a top research organization. I know he will\nbring the skills he developed at the Chicago Fed to his new job as director of the\nKaufman Center.\nBefore I begin, I should note that the views I share with you today are my own and do\nnot necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me start with a few words about George Kaufman. George spent most of his career\nin Chicago—which began when he joined the Chicago Fed straight out of graduate\nschool in 1959. After about a decade working at the Bank, George spent time on the\nEast and West Coasts before deciding that Chicago is where he belonged: He took a\n\nMark C. Reed is the president of Loyola University Chicago.\nDouglas D. Evanoff is the director of the George G. Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies, Quinlan School of\nBusiness, Loyola University Chicago. More information about the center is available online,\nhttps://www.luc.edu/quinlan/about/leadershipcenterslabs/finpol/.\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\fjob here at Loyola University, where he remained for the rest of his lengthy career. After\nreturning to the area, he quickly reconnected with the Chicago Fed.\nGeorge had a deep and long-lasting connection to the Federal Reserve, which began\nwhen the institution wasn’t yet 50 years old. To give you an idea of that connection,\nwhen the Fed celebrated its centennial in 2013, George was invited to serve on the\nSystem’s centennial committee along with past Federal Reserve Chairs Paul Volker and\nAlan Greenspan, as well as other financial regulatory leaders.\nCreating the Bank Structure and International Banking Conferences\nAmong his many contributions, George played a central role in creating the Bank\nStructure Conference 3 and the International Banking Conference, 4 two long-running\nconference series organized by the Chicago Fed.\nThe inaugural Bank Structure Conference, which many considered the preeminent\nbanking forum, was held in 1963. This conference was held regularly for over\n50 years. George was likely the only person who attended both the first and last\nBank Structure Conferences. 5\nAs an economist, the director of research, and later president of the Chicago Fed, I\nmade it a point to attend these conferences. As some of you no doubt remember, there\nwas a strong group of regular attendees, including George, George Bentson, Ed Kane,\n\nDetails on the Bank Structure Conference series are available online, https://www.chicagofed.org/events/bscseries.\n4\nDetails on the International Banking Conference series are available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/events/international-series.\n5\nThe Bank Structure Conference was created as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court case that required bank\nregulatory agencies find the most effective means of analyzing the antitrust implications of bank mergers. George\nimmediately gathered the most knowledgeable people in the Federal Reserve System to debate the alternatives.\n3\n\n3\n\n\fand a number of younger scholars. The mix produced many interesting discussions that\nhad a lasting impact.\nThe Bank Structure Conference that George was instrumental in founding quickly\nestablished a strong reputation. And as the global financial system became more\ninterconnected, George—along with Curt Hunter, who was my predecessor as research\ndirector at the Bank—saw a need to supplement the generally more U.S.-focused\nconference with one having a more international emphasis. In 1997 they, along with\nDoug Evanoff, organized the Chicago Fed’s first International Banking Conference. This\nconference continued to draw thought leaders from around the world through 2016.\nThese two conferences brought together policymakers, academics, and industry\nrepresentatives to discuss important changes in the banking environment, to debate\nfuture risks, and to anticipate promising opportunities. One of the highlights of the Bank\nStructure Conference was the appearance of the Chair of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System. While Chair, Ben Bernanke spoke at six conferences and\nAlan Greenspan spoke a remarkable 16 times.\nGeorge realized the advantages of bringing together the best research minds to\ndiscuss and debate the issues. Not surprisingly, that is also the goal of this\ncenter—and this conference.\nConference themes\nBoth conferences had a penchant for anticipating challenges. For example, the focus of\nthe 1997 International Banking Conference was how to prevent banking crises. The\nconference was held in June, mere weeks before the Asian financial crisis began. Later,\n\n4\n\n\fin the years before the Great Financial Crisis, the role of large banks in systemic\nfinancial risks was examined again in 2004—when the conference theme was Systemic\nFinancial Crises: Resolving Large Bank Insolvencies—and in 2007—when the theme\nwas Globalization and Systemic Risk.\nSimilarly, presentations at Bank Structure Conferences anticipated regulatory reforms in\nbanking, with most proposed changes discussed at the conferences for many years\nbefore any actions were implemented. 6 The topic of changes in bank capital regulation\ncomes to mind, and I see that it is again on today’s program. Years before imposing a\nformal set of minimum capital requirements in the 1980s, their potential adoption was\nthe focus of the 1975 conference. There is a long list of banking laws, with elements\nvigorously debated at the conferences both before and after their passage—FDICIA,\nRiegle–Neal, Gramm–Leach–Bliley, and FIRREA are among them. 7\nThis is a good time to point out the central role George played in many of these\ndebates. George was a leader in thinking about the importance of bank capital. He\nunderstood that banks had an incentive to take on more risk as they became weaker\nand approached insolvency. He pressed regulators to require banks to hold more\ncapital as they weakened and, additionally, to increase their supervisory oversight.\nThrough George’s efforts, both of these regulatory enhancements were incorporated in\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act.\n\nThis observation is from Evanoff et al. (2008).\nFDICIA stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Riegle–Neal is shorthand\nfor the Riegle–Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Gramm–Leach–Bliley is shorthand for\nthe Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act) of 1999. Finally, FIRREA\nstands for the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.\n\n6\n7\n\n5\n\n\fDiscussion of research presented at the conferences\nThose earlier conferences inspired and produced much cutting-edge research. Doug\nEvanoff, along with several co-authors including Bob DeYoung, who’s in the audience\ntoday, examined over 600 research papers that were presented at the first 40 or so\nBank Structure Conferences. Impressively, over three-quarters of them were later\npublished—many in the top economics and finance journals. 8 One-hundred and two\nwere in what we call A-level journals, such as the Journal of Finance and the American\nEconomic Review, with another 155 accepted by journals most academics would be\nvery happy with. Some of these articles were quite influential in the academic literature\nand in the development of public policy. They spurred vigorous debate and produced\na more nuanced understanding of the financial sector. Let me highlight a few of\nthe contributions.\nGeorge correctly argued that banks with low capital have an incentive to take additional\nrisk. However, there is also a countervailing force that was first pointed out by Michael\nKeeley of the San Francisco Fed in a paper he presented at the Bank Structure\nConference in 1989. 9 Keeley argued that the “charter value” of banks—that is, banks’\nability to earn profits in the future—reduces the incentives for banks to take risk. A bank\nthat has market power—and thus the ability to profit in the future—may refrain from\ngambling even if it currently has low capital. His influential paper gave policymakers and\nacademics a novel way to think about bank competition, which continues to this day.\n\n8\n9\n\nEvanoff et al. (2008).\nThis paper was later published as Keeley (1990).\n\n6\n\n\fAnother important debate aired at the Bank Structure Conferences involved the\nquestion of what activities banks should be permitted to engage in. The banking crisis at\nthe start of the Great Depression prompted Congress to pass the Glass–Steagall Act,\nwhich in part was designed to separate the banking business into two separate\nfunctions: Commercial banks would accept deposits and make loans, while investment\nbanks would bring debt and equity issues to market and trade securities and other\ninstruments. This distinction held for several decades; however, as early as the 1960s,\nboth commercial and investment banks began to encroach on each other’s turf. This\nsparked a debate about whether the Glass–Steagall Act was necessary. Randy\nKroszner and Raghu Rajan, both of the University of Chicago, presented an influential\npiece of research at the Bank Structure Conference in 1992. It was eventually published\nas “Is the Glass–Steagall Act justified? A study of the U.S. experience with universal\nbanking before 1933.” 10 In it, the authors argued persuasively that the fears that banks\nwould have a conflict of interest when bringing to market securities of firms they had lent\nto were not well founded. Their influential paper helped support the repeal of the Glass–\nSteagall Act that happened as a part of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.\nThe Bank Structure Conference was also a forum to present research on whether and\nhow banks are special—a topic that continues to be discussed today. In the early\n1990s, Allen Berger and Greg Udell presented their work on relationship lending and\nthe role of lines of credit in financing small firms. Their notable paper later appeared in\nthe Journal of Business. 11 Allen and Greg, both of whom are here, pointed out one way\n\n10\n11\n\nKroszner and Rajan (1994).\nBerger and Udell (1995).\n\n7\n\n\fthat banks can be considered special: They argued that banks learn about their\ncustomers and develop long-term relationships with borrowers that affect both the\ninterest rates and collateral required on loans. This afternoon Allen will present his latest\nwork with Arnoud Boot of the University of Amsterdam on bank specialness.\nBanks didn’t seem so special—at least in a good way—in the aftermath of the Great\nFinancial Crisis. Both the Bank Structure Conference and the International Banking\nConference had a number of memorable presentations on risks and what to do in\nresponse to the Great Financial Crisis. We heard from Anat Admati of Stanford\nUniversity about her work with colleagues arguing that banks be required to hold more\ncapital to mitigate financial instability risks. This, as you can imagine, wasn’t very\npopular with the bankers in the audience. We also heard from Rob Engle of New York\nUniversity, who with his co-author Christian Brownlees developed a measure of\nsystemic risk. In a notable presentation, recent Nobel Prize winner Douglas Diamond\ndiscussed the consequences of liquidity risk. 12\nThe Bank Structure and International Banking Conferences that George advanced were\nimportant forums for high-quality academic researchers to inform and learn from\npolicymakers and industry professionals. While we’ve made a lot of progress since the\nfirst Bank Structure Conference in 1963, some of the same issues remain—and we\nhave a host of new ones. Later today, you’ll hear about bank capital regulation—a\nperennial issue—as well as bank uniqueness and how bank regulators should think\n\nThe published versions of these papers are Admati et al. (2014), Brownlees and Engle (2017), and Diamond and\nKashyap (2016). Some of Diamond’s earlier work on liquidity—eventually published as Diamond and Rajan\n(2005)—was initially presented by his co-author at one of the conferences.\n\n12\n\n8\n\n\fabout social goals. The sessions on these topics promise to provide insightful and\nstimulating discussions.\nConcluding remarks\nThe Kaufman Center and this conference are meaningful extensions of George’s drive\nto create an ongoing forum for expert discussion. Among other objectives, the center\naims to bring together nationally recognized experts in banking and financial services,\nstudents, the banking community, and the general public to inform policy debates and\nstimulate important research.\nThe center’s focus on topics that George Kaufman was passionate about is a fitting\ntribute to George’s memory and legacy. I anticipate hearing about the Kaufman Center\nand its impact on policy for years to come.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\nAdmati, Anat R., Peter M. DeMarzo, Martin F.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThe last time I spoke at a NABE event was in September 2021. 1 At that time we had\nonly begun to see some broadening of inflation beyond items most directly affected by\npandemic-related relative price swings. Most forecasters, including myself and many of\nyou in this room, thought the momentum wouldn’t be sustained and were forecasting\ninflation to return near the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2022. 2\nWell, the economic landscape certainly looks different now! In the U.S. and elsewhere\naround the world, what began as narrowly concentrated shocks to relative prices has\nspread, turning into broad-based increases in overall inflation to levels far above every\ncentral bank’s target. Accordingly, monetary policymakers now are significantly\ntightening policy in order to bring inflation back in line with their price stability mandates.\nSince March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the\nfederal funds rate—our main policy tool—by 3 percentage points. We also are reducing\nthe size of our balance sheet at a relatively rapid clip.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent average goal. To\ndo so, I expect we will need to raise rates further and then to hold that stance for a\n\nEvans (2021).\nThe median projection in the September 2021 NABE Outlook Survey for core inflation in 2022 as measured by the\nPrice Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) was 2.2 percent (National Association for Business\nEconomics, 2021). Core inflation strips out the volatile food and energy sectors and is a better indicator of\nunderlying inflation trends than is total inflation.\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\fwhile. Of course, the exact path forward for policy will depend on the evolution of the\neconomy and risks to the outlook. My talk today will describe my thinking behind this\npath in more detail, as well as why I think we can bring inflation down relatively quickly\nwhile also avoiding a recession.\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my\nown and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThis audience is certainly familiar with the current situation. So I won’t spend too much\ntime discussing the incoming data—which as you know have been mixed. Household\nand business spending have been moderating. Lower real disposable income and a\npolicy-induced tightening in financial conditions are clearly in play, most notably in the\nvery interest-rate-sensitive housing markets, where mortgage rates have about doubled\nsince the beginning of the year.\nIn contrast, the labor market remains strong, with robust job growth, elevated job\nopenings and quits, and an unemployment rate that is at the very low level we\nexperienced before the Covid crisis. However, over the past few months we’ve heard\nmore reports from our business and community contacts of reduced job turnover and\nthat some are finding it easier to attract qualified workers. These are signs that some of\nthe unusual strength in labor demand may be waning. Increasing pay and more flexible\nwork arrangements may be part of the explanation, as well as the softer growth in\nspending. As of yet, these anecdotal reports haven’t shown through strongly in the\naggregate data, although job growth has moderated some from its extremely rapid pace\n3\n\n\fand last week’s JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report contained a\nnotable drop in vacancies.\nOn the labor supply side, while many workers who left the labor force during the\npandemic have reentered the labor market, many others have not, and today labor force\nparticipation is still well below its pre-pandemic rate. Most of this shortfall is accounted\nfor by older workers, as the pandemic apparently accelerated the retirement decision for\nmany baby boomers who would have eventually exited from the labor force anyway.\nAnother factor weighing on labor supply is the quite low inflow to the U.S. labor force\nfrom immigration.\nA strong labor market may still help draw some of those sitting on the sidelines back\ninto the workforce and alleviate some labor market pressure. When I spoke here last\nyear, I expected the labor supply response to be fairly large, but as time passes, I’ve\nbecome less optimistic that this channel will provide much relief from labor market\npressures. Indeed, the labor force participation rate currently does not appear far from\nits long-term trend. 3\nPolicy adjustments needed to bring inflation into line with goal\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is the principal issue facing the economy in the\nU.S. and elsewhere around the world—inflation. After more than a decade of missing\nour average 2 percent target to the downside, PCE inflation has risen quite quickly—\n\nAfter many years of sustained economic growth leading up to the Covid crisis, labor force participation had been\nhigher than demographic and other trends would have predicted.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\ffrom under 1 percent in mid-2020 to 6.2 percent in the most recent August data. 4\nExcluding food and energy, core PCE prices rose 4.9 percent over the past 12 months.\nReducing inflation to a level consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent objective will require a\nperiod of restrictive financial conditions to restore better balance between supply and\ndemand economy-wide. This will generate below-trend growth and some softening of\nlabor market conditions. But ensuring low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for\nachieving the sustained strong labor market outcomes that bring benefits to everyone in\nour society.\nThese broad contours are demonstrated in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP), which this audience is undoubtedly familiar with. 5 The SEP dot plot\nshows that most FOMC participants are looking at something like another 100 to\n125 basis points of rate increases this calendar year, with the median projection for\nthe federal funds rate then rising a bit further to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.\nThis monetary restraint is clearly showing through in the projection for GDP growth,\nwhich the median participant sees running somewhat below its long-run rate over the\nnext year and a half or so before moving back up to trend later in the projection period.\nThe unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.4 percent by late next year and then\nremain near that level in 2024 and 2025. While this does represent a noticeably\n\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption\nExpenditures.\n5\nFederal Open Market Committee (2022). The quarterly Summary of Economic Projections presents FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three to four years and for the longer run.\n4\n\n5\n\n\fsofter labor market when compared with today’s, these certainly are not\nrecession-like numbers. 6\nAs for inflation, with supply-side improvements, restrictive monetary policy, and belowtrend growth, inflation is expected to moderate significantly. According to the median\nSEP projection, total PCE inflation is expected to fall to 2.8 percent in 2023 and\neventually return to our 2 percent target by the end of 2025. I should note that my\npersonal forecast is broadly in line with the median SEP forecast. This is also true for\nmany outside forecasters as we see in the NABE Outlook Survey that was released this\nmorning, although the NABE survey’s median federal funds rate is somewhat below the\nSEP’s median. 7\nDoes this forecast make sense?\nIn sum, the consensus baseline is projecting a large decline in inflation over the next\nyear and a half, but with only a modest increase in the unemployment rate. A pretty\ngood-looking soft landing. Now, we all recognize the substantial uncertainty surrounding\nthe outlook today. But what about this baseline? What rationale can get us there? I can’t\nspeak for others, but let me walk you through some of my thinking. And remember this\nis a modal forecast, and other, less rosy alternatives have a reasonable likelihood\nof occurring.\nI’ll begin with some familiar observations about the role that relative price adjustments\nand supply chain problems played in the rapid increase in prices. The pandemic\n\nFor comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate has peaked at over 6 percent either during or shortly after every\nrecession since World War II.\n7\nThe NABE Outlook Survey is available online, https://nabe.com/NABE/NABE/Surveys/Surveys.aspx.\n6\n\n6\n\n\finduced a shift in household spending from services, such as travel or dining out,\ntoward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer\nelectronics. Many goods-producing businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong\ndemand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply\nchains. Labor shortages due to a broad-based drop in labor force participation were part\nof the story, too.\nInflation began to pick up in early 2021 as prices rose sharply for goods that were\nespecially sensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just beginning\nto reopen from the pandemic shutdowns. It has taken us time to get there, but today\nthere are a number of signs that supply chain difficulties are improving: Ports are less\ncongested, freight costs are falling, and supplier delivery times are improving. And with\nthe pandemic bounce-back behind us, some heat is coming off items such as airfares\nand hotel prices.\nBut all is not well yet. For example, for quite a while, a shortage of microprocessors held\nback the production of motor vehicles. Well, the chip shortage seems to be largely\nresolved, but shortages of other parts are now reportedly limiting assemblies. The\nproblems at parts suppliers appear related to difficulties they are still having in staffing\nproduction lines. I’m sure we’ve all heard many other anecdotes that highlight this\ninteraction between labor market tightness and supply chain issues. Save this idea—I’ll\ncome back to it in a moment.\nLooking ahead, supply chain repair will continue and consumption patterns will\nnormalize; and we may also see some further recovery in labor force participation,\nthough as I mentioned, I think the prospects for this are limited. Admittedly, these\n7\n\n\fadjustments have taken much longer than I had expected. And disruptions from the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine and unpredictable Covid-related shutdowns, notably in\nChina, haven’t helped. But progress has been made, and more is coming. And the\nreduced price pressures from these supply-side adjustments are an important factor in\nmy forecast for declining inflation.\nHowever, over the past year or so we’ve seen a lot more inflation than can be explained\nby changes in relative prices: We’ve experienced a broad-based increase in inflationary\npressures that monetary policy must address. Without a period of restrictive policy,\ninflation will come down some, but not to anything near our 2 percent objective. The\nrequired monetary response will restrain aggregate demand. An important question then\nis, how much will this restraint weigh on the employment leg of our dual mandate?\nObviously, the pandemic-era shocks have wreaked havoc on the usual relationships\nbetween economic variables and on the models we use to explain them. This has been\nparticularly true in the labor market. Here, though, the unfamiliar patterns point to\nreasons why our inflation forecast may be achieved with only moderate increases\nin unemployment.\nFor example, there is the configuration of the Beveridge curve, where we have seen a\nmarked increase in the vacancy rate observed for any given unemployment rate. 8 It is\npossible that as labor demand subsides, we could see a large decline in vacancies and\nreduced pressure on wages and inflation without a corresponding large increase in the\n\nThe Beveridge curve refers to the inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate.\nA chart plotting the Beveridge Curve from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is available online,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/job-openings-unemployment-beveridge-curve.htm.\n\n8\n\n8\n\n\funemployment rate. Indeed, the drop in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment in the\nAugust JOLTS report is good news for this hypothesis.\nNow, there is a good deal of debate over this topic, and I don’t want to wade into that\nhere. Indeed, I have a confession—I’ve always been more comfortable viewing labor\nmarket dynamics and inflation through the lens of the Phillips curve. 9 Call me a\nhopeless romantic. Anyway, here, too, I see unusual behavior that suggests we can\ndisinflate without a large increase in unemployment if we navigate the path to a\nreasonably restrictive policy setting carefully and judiciously.\nThe rapid increase in inflation we’ve experienced can be explained by a temporary\nsteepening in the Phillips curve. Conceptually, this steeper-than-usual Phillips curve is\ndue to the unusual interactions between labor market tightness and supply chain\nproblems that I noted earlier—namely, the lack of materials and parts arising\nfrom shortages of labor at upstream suppliers. This phenomenon appears to be\nfairly widespread.\nBecause of this additional supply chain channel, at recent unemployment rates, labor\nmarket stress is having a larger effect on inflation than would typically be the case.\nThese extra supply chain interactions were not an issue when the unemployment rate\nwas around the same low level in 2019, and so we saw less of an inflationary impact\nfrom tight labor markets back then. If this steeper-than-usual Phillips curve is generating\nmuch of the higher inflation we are seeing now, then we should also expect this steeper\n\nThe Phillips curve is a statistical relationship that describes a negative correlation between inflation and\nunemployment—that is, lower unemployment is associated with higher price and wage inflation. It is often drawn\nas a negatively sloped curve that has a measure of labor market tightness, such as the unemployment rate, on the\nhorizontal axis and a measure of wage or price inflation on the vertical axis. See Phillips (1958).\n\n9\n\n9\n\n\fcurve to help bring inflation down relatively quickly with only moderate increases in\nunemployment. Steep on the way up is steep on the way down.\nFurthermore, I have in mind a nonaccelerationist Phillips curve, in which inflation\nexpectations are not a mechanical function of recent inflation. Today, longer-term\ninflation expectations are anchored near our target, and so provide an important\ndownward force on actual inflation. So my baseline forecast sees the combination of\nfurther supply-side repair, a steeper Phillips curve, and anchored long-run inflation\nexpectations moving inflation back to target without having to generate an inordinate\namount of slack in the economy.\nThis mechanism does, however, require reducing the heat in labor and product markets\nas well as maintaining a downward pull from inflation expectations. This is where tighter\nmonetary policy comes into play. I see the nominal funds rate rising to a bit above\n4-1/2 percent early next year and then remaining at this level for some time while we\nassess how our policy adjustments are affecting the economy. When you factor in\ninflation expectations and the reductions in our balance sheet, we’ll be at something\nequivalent to nearly a 2 percent real funds rate at this time. This is a fair amount of\nrestriction when compared with the 1/4 to 1/2 percent long-run real neutral federal funds\nrate that is implied in the SEP. But I feel it is needed to facilitate market adjustments by\nbringing aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and to ensure\nthat long-run inflation expectations remain in check.\nOur rapid pace of rate increases has fast-tracked our arrival to such a restrictive\nstance. Front-loading was a good thing, given how far below neutral rates were. But\novershooting is costly, too, and there is great uncertainty about how restrictive policy\n10\n\n\fmust actually become. This puts a premium on the strategy of getting to a place where\npolicy can plan to rest and evaluate data and developments.\nRisks and policy communications\nThere are many risks that could derail this optimistic forecast. And, unfortunately, many\nof those risks appear to be to the downside: Supply-side repair could continue to move\ntoo slowly; events in Ukraine or further Covid-related shutdowns could put additional\npressure on costs; and monetary policy may, on the one hand, not rein inflation in\nenough or, on the other hand, weigh too heavily on employment.\nAnother risk is that inflation expectations could become unanchored. Inflation will be\nmuch more difficult to rein in if households and businesses start thinking outsized\nincreases in wages and prices are the new norm and incorporate those expectations\ninto their decision-making. But the good news is that, in general, measures of longerhorizon inflation expectations have remained within a range that is consistent with our\n2 percent inflation objective. This is true in most surveys or in the compensation for\ninflation that is priced into financial market assets, suggesting households and\nbusinesses see the primary drivers of inflationary pressures as being shorter-lived.\nThese perceptions can change and aren’t something we can take for granted. I believe\nthe Federal Reserve’s strong policy actions and communications have played an\nimportant role in anchoring long-run inflation expectations by demonstrating and\nconveying our commitment to bring inflation back into line with our 2 percent average\nobjective. The public and markets appear to believe we will be successful. But it is up to\nus to follow through and do our job.\n\n11\n\n\fNow policy communications has many aspects to it. I admit we don’t always get it\nperfect—and we certainly hear from you when we don’t! Then again, sometimes we\nreceive criticism about what I see as useful communications. In particular, I know some\nare uncomfortable with the idea that the Fed provides projections for policy rates in the\nSEP, knowing that we will certainly see a different path for rates if economic conditions\nor risks turn out otherwise. Some even say this is a good reason not to provide such\nprojections at all—if you can’t tell me the number for sure, why tell me anything? I\nstrongly disagree with this view. Monetary policy is clearly influencing our projections,\nso what’s the downside of revealing how we view its role in doing so?\nI know we have had elevated financial market volatility at times over this rate cycle.\nThese are uncertain times, and no communications can—or should—reduce underlying\nfundamental economic uncertainty. But think how much additional uncertainty and\ncostly volatility we would have unnecessarily generated over the past year if we had not\naugmented our policy moves with guidance about our plans for the ultimate level for the\nfederal funds rate and its expected influence on economic outcomes.\nIndeed, even though rate hikes didn’t begin until March, the information in the SEPs and\nother Fed communications likely assisted in substantially tightening financial conditions\nby mid-year, and did so without the large dislocations in financial flows that have at\ntimes accompanied past changes in the trajectory of policy. And given how quickly\nfinancial conditions reacted to our policy communications, perhaps we have shortened\none leg of the long and variable lags of the monetary transmission mechanism. This\nseems like a good development.\n\n12\n\n\fConclusion\nI realize I may have come off this morning sounding rather optimistic. I don’t want to\ndiminish the task in front of us or downplay the difficulties some may experience under\nthe less favorable labor market conditions envisioned by my baseline outlook. And there\nis a real risk of seeing heavier costs with a larger-than-expected drop in employment.\nThese are things we must be mindful of.\nNo matter the circumstances, the FOMC will always set policy with the goal of\nprogressing toward both our dual mandate objectives of maximum inclusive\nemployment and price stability as expeditiously as possible. Today, though, inflation is\nour primary concern. Reducing it will likely require a sustained period of restrictive\nmonetary policy, below-trend growth, and some softening of labor market conditions.\nBut this is necessary to restore inflation to our 2 percent target. We hope to achieve this\ngoal as quickly and efficiently as possible, leading to a period of sustained price stability\nand strong labor market outcomes under which all can prosper.\nThank you.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\nEvans, Charles L., 2021, “Going the distance on inflation,” speech at the 63rd National\nAssociation for Business Economics (NABE) Annual Meeting, Arlington, VA,\nSeptember 27, available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2021/september-27-nabe-annualmeeting.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022, Summary of Economic Projections,\nWashington, DC, September 21, available online,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf.\nNational Association for Business Economics, 2021, “NABE panelists temper forecast\nfor GDP growth in 2021; two-thirds expect full job market recovery by late 2022,” NABE\nOutlook Survey summary, Washington, DC, September, available online,\nhttps://www.nabe.com/NABE/NABE/Surveys/Outlook_Surveys/september-2021Outlook-Survey-Summary.aspx.\nPhillips, A.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nGood morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago I would like to\nwelcome you to the third annual Exploring Career Pathways conference. Let me extend\nmy deep thanks to our friends and colleagues at the Sadie Collective for pioneering this\nevent and partnering with us to create a fantastic program. We are very excited that for\nthe first time since we launched our partnership with the Sadie Collective, this event will\nfeature a significant live, in-person component! We hope this will allow all of you to build\neven stronger connections. Speaking of being in person, I wish I could be in Chicago\nwith you today, but my schedule changed at the last minute. Hence, I’m welcoming you\non this recorded video.\nThis Career Pathways conference has quickly become the cornerstone of the Chicago\nFed–Sadie Collective partnership. We look forward to building up our partnership with\nthe Sadie Collective in the years to come through other events, initiatives, and additional\nsupport that the Chicago Fed can provide. Earlier this summer, in conjunction with the\nSadie Collective, we held an event that highlighted the careers of Black women at the\nChicago Fed. Nearly 100 individuals attended!\nAt the Chicago Fed we have a strong diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program to\nensure that DEI is embedded throughout our organization and within each and every\none of our business lines. We do a better job of delivering on all aspects of the Federal\n2\n\n\fReserve’s mission when a diversity of backgrounds and experiences is reflected in our\nwork. So, promoting DEI in our workplace is both the right thing to do and a business\nimperative for us. We include DEI goals in department and individual performance\nplans—with a cross-department DEI committee and our DEI consultants holding us\naccountable. We also work with 16 external partners and community groups, including\nthe Sadie Collective, that support our efforts to diversify our talent pipelines. These\npartners help us to build and sustain a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive\nworkplace where all employees feel valued, respected, and heard.\nWe believe our DEI efforts are important not just for the Chicago Fed, but also for the\nbroader field of economics. It is no secret that economics has a representation\nproblem—with few women, people of color, and first-generation students pursuing\ncourses of study and careers in the field.\nBy fully committing to DEI efforts within the Bank and by emphasizing the recruitment,\nmentoring, and development of future economists from diverse backgrounds, we believe\nwe can not only create a better community within the Federal Reserve, but also\ncontribute positively to the economics discipline overall. Our partnership with the Sadie\nCollective is a crucial component of these efforts.\nWe are proud to cosponsor today’s event. It represents a truly collaborative effort\nintended to provide Black students and early-career talent with opportunities to explore\ncareer pathways in economics and related professions. We want to welcome you into\nthese professions and support you in a variety of ways to help you thrive in these fields.\n\n3\n\n\fAs part of our partnership with the Sadie Collective, the Chicago Fed has recruited Sadie\nCollective Fellows into our summer internship program for the past two years, and we\nplan to continue this practice each summer. So, if you’re a junior, please consider\napplying soon to join us next summer!\nToday’s conference program features panels of economists and research assistants.\nYou’ll be able to learn about the tools of economics research, and you’ll have the\nopportunity to participate in a career fair. We’re especially excited to hear from Helene\nGayle, president of Spelman College. We know Helene well, as she currently serves as\nchair of the Chicago Fed’s board of directors. And we very much appreciate her\nhighlighting this conference with a fireside chat conversation led by Marionette Holmes,\nchair of Spelman’s Economics Department.\nSpeaking of connections between the Chicago Fed and participants on today’s program,\nRyan Perry, Maya Love, and Yetunde Oshagbemi—the three panelists on the research\nassistants panel—have all been Sadie Collective summer interns with our Research\nDepartment! Way to go! Let me now turn things over to Diamondnia Mack,\nmembership growth associate at the Sadie Collective, who will be delivering additional\nwelcome remarks.\n\n4\n\n\f"

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction and disclaimer\nThe last time I spoke to you was in June 2020 for what was only my second of many\nvirtual events to follow. 1 I eventually learned how to look into the camera and how to\nunmute myself. Still, I much prefer to interact directly with people, and it’s great to be\nhere in person with you today. I am especially looking forward to answering your\nquestions and hearing your concerns following my prepared remarks. Thank you in\nadvance for your insights.\nTwo years ago, we were just emerging from the shutdowns, unemployment was quite\nhigh, and vaccines had not yet been developed. The future looked quite uncertain. As\nfor inflation, it was running below 1 percent and we were seeing large price declines for\nsome items most directly affected by social distancing. Well, things sure do look\ndifferent now!\nIn a nutshell, inflation is clearly much too high and monetary policy must be repositioned\nto bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into balance. I support the quick\nremoval of monetary accommodation that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nhas undertaken, increasing the federal funds rate 150 basis points since March and\nbeginning to reduce the size of our balance sheet. And while the exact path forward for\n\n1\n\nEvans (2020).\n\n2\n\n\fpolicy will depend on how the economy evolves, I expect it will be necessary to bring\nrates up a good deal more over the coming months in order to return inflation to the\nCommittee’s 2 percent average inflation target. 2\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my\nown and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThough gross domestic product (GDP) declined a bit in the first quarter of the year,\nunderlying economic momentum continued to be strong. Importantly, growth in\nhousehold consumption and business fixed investment continued at a solid pace last\nquarter. The top-line GDP number instead was held back by large reductions in\nbusiness inventory investment and net exports, which tend to be quite volatile on a\nquarter-by-quarter basis. And when I look at the GDP data in conjunction with other\nindicators of economic activity—notably, the very strong labor market and healthy\nhousehold and business balance sheets—I see the foundation for continued growth in\neconomic activity.\nGiven how bleak the situation appeared in the spring of 2020—when much of the\neconomy had shut down with the onset of the pandemic—our progress these past\ncouple of years has been truly remarkable. How did we get here? Businesses showed\ningenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The health care sector was able to develop\n\nFor price stability, the FOMC seeks inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as measured by the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\fand deploy vaccines extremely rapidly. And fiscal and monetary policymakers provided\ncrucial support through prompt and massive policy actions. By the second quarter of\nlast year, activity in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, and despite periodic\nnew waves of infections, underlying growth has remained quite solid since then.\nIn terms of the labor market, after peaking near 15 percent early in the pandemic, the\nunemployment rate declined quickly and was a very healthy 3.6 percent in May of this\nyear—essentially back to the low level we experienced before the Covid crisis. And by a\nnumber of other measures, such as unfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at\nwhich people quit their jobs for other opportunities, the labor market is downright tight.\nMany of my business and community contacts complain of difficulties in hiring and\nretaining workers, though increasing pay and other adjustments seem to be alleviating\nsome of these issues.\nEven so, the number of people actually employed is still well below pre-pandemic\ntrends, as many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have not\nreentered the labor market. Today, labor force participation continues to be held down\nby factors such as an elevated level of retirements and Covid-related matters, including\nhealth concerns or childcare issues. Furthermore, inflows to the labor force from\nimmigration have been quite low.\nAs the pandemic recedes further, a strong labor market will likely draw many of those\nstill sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce. This should help alleviate some\nlabor market pressures. At the same time, I expect less accommodative monetary policy\nwill dampen very high labor demand.\n\n4\n\n\fInflation dynamics\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is on everyone’s mind—inflation. Our preferred\ninflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption\nExpenditures (PCE). After more than a decade of sub-2 percent inflation, it has risen\nquite quickly from under 1 percent when I spoke to you in 2020 to 6.3 percent in the\nmost recent April data. What is behind this rapid run-up?\nSome of it is directly related to the pandemic. With people forced or choosing to spend\nmore time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or\ndining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or\nconsumer electronics. Many businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong\ndemand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply\nchains. Labor shortages due to the drop in participation were part of the story, too.\nThese factors first showed through to inflation in early 2021, as activity began to\nnormalize. Prices rose sharply for goods that were especially sensitive to supply chain\nproblems and for services that were just beginning to reopen from the pandemic\nshutdowns. But these pandemic-related and other supply-side factors are not the entire\nstory. Notably, beginning last autumn, price pressures began to build more broadly. At\nfirst, price increases for goods spread beyond those items most directly impacted by\npandemic dynamics. Higher inflation then extended to a wide range of services. The\nbroad-based nature of these increases is a sign of widespread, general demand\npressures on the productive capacity of the economy.\n\n5\n\n\fInflation should moderate\nMost forecasters, myself included, predict that inflation will cool down substantially over\nthe next couple of years. Let me explain the reasoning behind my forecast.\nFirst, over time, we will see supply chains repaired, consumption return to more normal\npatterns, and pandemic reopening effects fall behind us. In addition, the further recovery\nin labor force participation I mentioned earlier—some of it due to the strong labor market\nand higher wages we are seeing today—should lead to an easing of labor shortages\nthat would benefit all sectors. As these supply-side improvements occur, price\npressures will diminish.\nAdmittedly, these adjustments are taking much longer than I had earlier expected. And\ndisruptions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and unpredictable Covid-related\nshutdowns abroad are continuing to snarl supply, pushing prices higher for some items\nand adding to the overall uncertainty. But eventually these adjustments will occur: They\nare the hallmark of an economy in which prices provide the signals that guide resources\nto their most productive and profitable uses.\nSecond, tighter monetary policy plays a very important role in my forecast of lower\ninflation. It is needed to pull back on aggregate demand and keep it from pushing too\nhard on today’s still-challenged supply conditions. It is also needed to prevent current\nlarge price increases from becoming embedded in pricing dynamics and longer-run\ninflation expectations. Inflation will be much more difficult to rein in if households and\nbusinesses start thinking current outsized increases in wages and prices are the new\nnorm and incorporate those expectations into their decision-making.\n\n6\n\n\fMeasures of inflation expectations over shorter time horizons picked up a lot early last\nyear and remain quite elevated. This is understandable as people took notice of the\nhigher prices they’ve been encountering. But, in general, longer-horizon measures of\ninflation expectations have remained within a range that is consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation objective. This is true in most surveys or in the compensation for inflation that is\npriced into financial market assets, suggesting households and businesses see the\nprimary drivers of inflationary pressures as being shorter-lived. And I believe the\nFederal Reserve’s policy actions and communications have played an important role in\nanchoring these expectations by demonstrating and conveying our commitment to bring\ninflation back into line with our 2 percent average objective.\nPolicy adjustments\nSo, with this in mind, what comes next for monetary policy? Last week, the FOMC\nvoted to raise the federal funds rate target by 75 basis points to a range of 1-1/2 to\n1-3/4 percent and indicated that more rate hikes will likely be in order. 3 This tightening\ncomes at the same time that we continue to reduce the size of our balance sheet. 4\nHow much more tightening might be necessary? One way to gauge this comes from the\nCommittee’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released last week,\nwhich presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next\nthree years and for the longer run. 5 The median projection for the federal funds rate is\nfor it to be in the range of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent by the end of this year and 3.8 percent\n\nThis was the largest federal funds rate hike in 28 years.\nFederal Open Market Committee (2022b).\n5\nFederal Open Market Committee (2022a).\n3\n4\n\n7\n\n\fby the end of 2023. With projected inflation taken into account, the inflation-adjusted\ninterest rates in this path are modestly above where the FOMC sees the long-run\nneutral rate—in other words, this path should have a modestly restrictive influence on\nthe economy. My own viewpoint is roughly in line with the median assessment.\nOf course, rates are not on a preset course: The FOMC will react to changes in the\neconomic landscape as they occur and will adjust policy accordingly in order to achieve\nour goals of full employment and price stability. This flexible data-driven approach was\non full display at the FOMC meeting we held last week. Until just before the meeting,\nmost or our communications had been telegraphing that a 50 basis point rate increase\nwas in store. However, the Friday before we met, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nreport for May was published. In it, the overall CPI accelerated and core inflation—\nwhich strips out the volatile food and energy components and is a better indicator of\nunderlying inflation trends—remained quite high. 6\nThis was quite disappointing, as the previous couple of reports had contained some\nhints of moderating inflation. For example, prices for core goods—where we would\nexpect easing supply chain pressures to show up first—rose strongly in May after\nrecording a slight decline, on balance, in March and April. Furthermore, rent and\nowners’ equivalent rent experienced large increases in May. Inflation in these\ncomponents tends to be fairly persistent; furthermore, rent is an unavoidable\n\nThe Consumer Price Index increased 1.0 percent in May, and core CPI increased 0.6 percent; these changes\nbrought the 12-month increases for the two measures to 8.6 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. In normal\ntimes, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics usually runs\nabout 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points higher than our preferred inflation gauge—the Price Index for Personal\nConsumption Expenditures.\n6\n\n8\n\n\fexpenditure that challenges many low- and moderate-income households, and as such,\nits inflation is particularly harmful. In addition, that same day there was a worrisome\nupside surprise in a key measure of long-run household inflation expectations.\nThis bad news on inflation was an important consideration for my supporting a 75 basis\npoint hike in the federal funds rate instead of the 50 basis point increase we had\nsignaled earlier. And as Chair Powell noted in his press conference after the FOMC\nmeeting, this view was shared by most of the Committee.\nThe outlook\nSo what does all of this mean for the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation? Let\nus return to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. 7 For GDP growth, the\nmedian projection for this year is 1.7 percent—a good deal lower than the FOMC\nmedian projection made in March, though still close to the underlying trend in GDP\ngrowth. Growth is projected to stay near this pace in 2023 and 2024. Some increase is\nexpected in the unemployment rate, with it rising to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024. This\nstill represents a healthy labor market by historical benchmarks; indeed, it is quite close\nto where the Committee sees the unemployment rate settling at over the longer run.\nAs for inflation, with supply-side improvements, somewhat restrictive monetary policy,\nand trend-like growth, I expect inflation will moderate significantly. My colleagues do as\nwell. According to the median SEP, after increasing to 5.2 percent this year, total PCE\n\n7\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2022a).\n\n9\n\n\finflation is expected fall to 2.6 percent in 2023 and 2.2 percent in 2024—just marginally\nabove our 2 percent target.\nConclusion\nOf course, all forecasts are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risks. And,\nunfortunately, many of those risks appear to be to the downside: Supply-side repair\ncould continue to move too slowly; events in Ukraine or further Covid-related shutdowns\nin China or other countries could put additional pressure on costs; and monetary policy\nmay, on the one hand, not rein inflation in enough or, on the other hand, weigh too\nheavily on employment.\nSo we must be watchful and ready to adjust our policy stance if changes in economic\ncircumstances dictate. I recognize we have some difficult work ahead of us. But I can\nassure you that we will always set policy with the goal of progressing toward our dual\nmandate objectives of maximum inclusive employment and 2 percent inflation as\nexpediently as possible.\nThank you, and now I look forward to your questions.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\nEvans, Charles L., 2020, “Some thoughts on the future of the U.S. economy,” speech\npresented virtually at the Corridor Business Journal Mid-Year Economic Review,\nJune 24, available online, https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2020/\nfuture-of-economy.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022a, Summary of Economic Projections,\nWashington, DC, June 15, available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/\nmonetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220615.pdf.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022b, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,”\npress release, Washington, DC, June 15, available online,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220615a.htm.\n\n11\n\n\f"

The last time I\nwas here, back in 2017, was for a dinner event not unlike this one. 1 At the\ntime, no one had heard of Covid, and my overwhelming monetary policy\nconcern was the long-term undershooting of our 2 percent inflation target\nand the importance of getting inflation up to our symmetric target. Well,\nthings sure do look different now!\n\nB.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will first set the stage by describing recent\neconomic developments before delving more deeply into my thinking on\nunderlying inflation dynamics and the implications for monetary policy.\n\nC.\n\nIn a nutshell, inflation is clearly much too high and monetary policy must\nbe repositioned to address this. The exact path for policy will depend on\nthe evolution of the economy. But from where we sit now, I support\nreturning the federal funds rate to neutral expeditiously.

And it may\nbe necessary to bring rates somewhat above neutral for a time to return\n\n1\n\nEvans (2017).\n\n2\n\n\finflation to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent\naverage inflation target. 2\nD.\n\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you\ntoday are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nII.\n\nEconomic overview\nA.\n\nThough gross domestic product (GDP) declined a bit in the first quarter of\nthe year, underlying economic momentum continues to be strong.\nImportantly, growth in household consumption and business fixed\ninvestment continued at a solid pace last quarter. The top-line GDP\nnumber instead was held back by large reductions in business inventory\ninvestment and net exports.\n1.\n\nAs for inventories, firms continued to rebuild stocks at a hefty rate\nlast quarter, but the pace fell short of the extremely rapid\nstockbuilding that took place in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n2.\n\nAnd the net export decline in part reflected a surge in imports,\nwhich themselves were satisfying domestic demand for\nconsumption, investment, and inventory restocking.\n\n3.\n\nSo when I look at the GDP data in conjunction with other indicators\nof economic activity—notably the strong labor market and healthy\n\nFor price stability, the FOMC seeks inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as measured by the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\fhousehold and business balance sheets—I see a good foundation\nfor further solid growth.\nB.\n\nGiven how bleak the situation appeared in the spring of 2020 when much\nof the economy had shut down with the onset of the pandemic, our\nprogress these past couple of years has been truly remarkable. How did\nwe get here?\n1.\n\nBusinesses showed ingenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The\nhealth care sector was able to develop and deploy vaccines\nextremely rapidly. And fiscal and monetary policymakers provided\ncrucial support through prompt and massive policy actions.\n\n2.\n\nBy the second quarter of last year, activity in the U.S. had\nsurpassed its pre-pandemic level, and despite periodic new\nwaves of infections, underlying growth has remained quite solid\nsince then.\n\nC.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, after peaking near 15 percent early in the\npandemic, the unemployment rate declined quickly and was a very healthy\n3.6 percent in April—essentially back to the low level we experienced\nbefore the Covid crisis. And by a number of other measures, such as\nunfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at which people quit their\njobs for other opportunities, the labor market is downright tight. Many of\nmy business and community contacts complain of difficulties in hiring and\nretaining workers, though increasing pay and other adjustments seem to\nbe alleviating some of these issues.\n4\n\n\fD.\n\nEven so, the number of people actually employed is still well below prepandemic trends, as many workers who left the labor force during the\npandemic have not reentered the labor market. Today labor force\nparticipation continues to be held down by factors such as fewer retirees\nreentering the workforce than in the past and Covid-related matters,\nincluding health concerns or childcare issues. Furthermore, inflows to the\nlabor force from immigration have been quite low.\n\nE.\n\nAs the pandemic recedes further, strong labor market conditions will likely\ndraw many of those still sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce.\nThis should help alleviate some labor market pressures. But the timing\nand extent of this return are open questions.\n\nIII.\n\nInflation dynamics\nA.\n\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is on everyone’s mind—inflation.\n\nB.\n\nOur preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). After more than a decade of\nsub-2 percent inflation, it has risen quite quickly from a very low\n1.3 percent in 2020 to 6.6 percent in the most recent April data. What is\nbehind this rapid run-up?\n\nC.\n\nSome of it is directly related to the pandemic. With people forced or\nchoosing to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending\nfrom services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as\nappliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics.\n5\n\n\fD.\n\nMany businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong demand,\nparticularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and\nsupply chains. Labor shortages due to the drop in participation were part\nof the story, too.\n\nE.\n\nThese factors first showed through to inflation in early 2021, as activity\nbegan to normalize. Prices rose sharply for goods that were especially\nsensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just\nbeginning to reopen from the pandemic shutdowns.\n1.\n\nMotor vehicles were a prime example. In the early stages of the\npandemic, the demand for cars plummeted and their prices actually\ndeclined. However, with high demand for personal as opposed to\npublic transit and low borrowing costs, vehicle demand quickly\nturned around.\n\n2.\n\nAutomakers were unprepared for the surge: Expecting a severe\nand prolonged recession, they had substantially scaled back their\nproduction plans and ordered fewer of the microprocessors that are\nubiquitous in vehicles today.\n\n3.\n\nAs a result of a dearth of chips and other shortages, auto and truck\nproduction has been severely curtailed. With constrained supply\nrunning into robust demand, motor vehicle prices have risen more\nthan 17 percent over the past year.\n\n6\n\n\f4.\n\nHome appliances are another example. With people spending more\ntime at home, homeowners tackled long-delayed repairs and\nundertook new home improvement projects. Furthermore, low\nmortgage rates and pandemic-related relocations boosted the\ndemand for housing. Demand for home furnishings accelerated\naccordingly, and prices for these items are running 10 percent\nhigher than they were a year ago.\n\n5.\n\nThere is a different story coming from the service sector. Early in\nthe pandemic people avoided traveling, and prices for hotel rooms\nplummeted. However, as the economy reopened and more\npeople began to travel again, that quickly changed: Over the past\n12 months, prices for lodging away from home have risen more\nthan 20 percent.\n\nIV.\n\nWhy did I pick these three items? Well, each has an easily identifiable pandemicrelated reason to explain the large price increases they experienced. Also, price\nchanges in these items had a big impact on the top-line inflation numbers—and\nso, too, they could contribute substantially to reductions in inflation as the\nparticular factors I just noted are unwound. Let me give you some numbers\nto illustrate.\n\n7\n\n\fA.\n\nBetween February 2021 and February 2022, 12-month core Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) inflation shot up from 1.3 percent to 6.4 percent and has\nstayed near that pace since. 3\n1.\n\nAlmost half of this pickup reflected outsized gains in prices for the\nthree items I just mentioned—new and used motor vehicles, home\nfurnishings and supplies, and hotel and motel accommodations—\nwhich together account for only about 15 percent of the core CPI.\n\n2.\n\nSo what about the flip side? I expect we will see meaningful relief\nfrom the pressures related to chip shortages, clogged supply\nchains, the shift to goods consumption, and reopening effects. This\nrelief should provide a substantial deceleration in the overall core\nprice index. For example, if the price levels for the three items I\nhighlighted did not change at all over the next year while price\nincreases for all other items stayed the same, then core CPI\ninflation would drop to about 3-1/2 percent. This would surely get\neveryone’s notice.\n\nV.\n\nMonetary policy must adjust\nA.\n\nEven improvements like these won’t be enough on their own. Other pricing\nchallenges remain.\n\n3\n\nMeasures of core inflation strip out volatile food and energy components.\n\n8\n\n\fB.\n\nFirst, supply chain issues have proved stubbornly difficult to solve.\nAnd as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and further Covid disruptions in\nChina remind us, unexpected events can generate even further supplyside problems.\n\nC.\n\nAnd, second, we still have the other 85 percent of core CPI to deal with.\nInflation for these items moved up from about 1-1/4 percent in February\n2021 to almost 4-1/2 percent in April 2022—well above the CPI-equivalent\nof the Federal Reserve’s average 2 percent target for total PCE inflation.\n\nD.\n\nNow, surely supply chain factors played some role in pushing up these\nprices, so alleviating bottlenecks will also help restrain cost pressures on\nthe 85 percent bucket as well. And all sectors should benefit from\nfurther recovery in labor force participation leading to an easing of\nlabor shortages.\n\nE.\n\nWith that said, monetary policy still has a critical role to play in addressing\nthis 85 percent bucket. Policy needs to moderate the strong demand\npressures underlying the broad-based run-up in prices. Policy also needs\nto act to keep longer-run inflation expectations in check; inflation will be\nmuch more difficult to bring down if households and businesses start\nthinking current outsized increases in wages and prices are the new norm.\nSo far these increases seem like adjustments to the unusual\ncircumstances we have faced in the past two years. Indeed, although\nshort-run measures of inflation expectations are quite high, longer-run\nexpectations appear in line with our 2 percent average inflation target.\n9\n\n\fF.\n\nSo, clearly, interest rates need to rise and we need to reduce the size of\nour balance sheet. How much adjustment will ultimately be needed? That\nis a tough question to answer.\n\nG.\n\nThe current fed funds rate is far below a neutral setting—which, as I\nmentioned before, I think is in the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. So\npolicy needs substantial repositioning.\n1.\n\nI favor a front-loaded adjustment in the fed funds rate toward the\nneutral range. I think front-loading is important to speed up the\nnecessary tightening of financial conditions, as well as for\ndemonstrating our commitment to restrain inflation, thus helping to\nkeep inflationary expectations in check.\n\n2.\n\nAnd given how far policy is below neutral today, the risks to our\nemployment mandate of moving expeditiously seem modest.\n\n3.\n\nThe FOMC’s half percentage point increase in the funds rate at our\nMay meeting is consistent with this approach, as is the initiation of\nbalance sheet reduction that is coming in June.\n\nH.\n\nAfter front-loading our initial tightening, I am hopeful we can transition to a\nmore measured pace of rate increases.\n1.\n\nWith inflation dynamics uncertain, this measured pace would give\nus time to monitor supply chains, assess inflation dynamics, and\nevaluate the impact of less accommodative monetary policy on the\nlabor market.\n10\n\n\f2.\n\nIf we need to, we will be well positioned to respond more\naggressively if inflation conditions do not improve sufficiently or,\nalternatively, to scale back planned adjustments if economic\nconditions soften in a way that threatens our employment mandate.\n\nI.\n\nIt is too early to know what the outcome of that calculus will be. But with\nthe current degree of inflationary pressures, I could see the need to take\npolicy somewhat beyond neutral to achieve our price stability mandate.\nGiven the current strength in aggregate demand, strong demand for\nworkers, and the supply-side improvements that I expect to be coming, I\nbelieve a modestly restrictive stance will still be consistent with a\ngrowing economy.\n\nVI.\n\nConclusion\nA.\n\nWe will learn a lot in the months ahead about how both monetary policy\ntightening and supply-side adjustments are influencing inflation.\nMonitoring and assessing inflation pressures and balancing risks to growth\nwill be crucial for judging the appropriate path for policy over this time.\n\nB.\n\nAs always, monetary policymakers can best achieve our dual mandate\nobjectives of price stability and maximum inclusive sustainable\nemployment by staying focused on our goals and clearly communicating\nour strategy for achieving them. I am sure that those principles will serve\nus at the Federal Reserve well as we maneuver through the uncertain\nmonths ahead.\n\n11\n\n\fC.\n\nThank you, and now I look forward to your questions.\n\n12\n\n\fReference\nEvans, Charles L., 2017, “Monetary policy challenges in a new inflation environment,”\nspeech for the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, June 19,\navailable online, https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2017/06-19-17monetary-policy-challenges-in-a-new-inflation-environment-money-marketeers.\n\n13\n\n\f"

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nThird Annual Fintech Conference\nPhiladelphia, PA\nNovember 14, 2019\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fInnovation on the Fringe and at the Core of Financial Services\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nI am delighted to be included in the third annual Fintech Conference, and grateful\nto our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and conference\npartners—the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Bank Policy\nInstitute, the Brookings Institution, and the University of Cambridge. We think of\nfintech as a new thing, but I’d like to begin my talk by considering a historical\nexample of financial technology and innovation from the time of the Fed’s\nfounding. Countless innovations have been made in finance throughout history.\nAnd policymakers, including central bankers, have long grappled with how to\nfoster financial innovation while at the same time ensuring the smooth operation\nof the financial system, as well as the stability of the broader macroeconomy.\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and\nnot necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nIn the early 1900s, many contemporaries saw the American payment system as\nslow and costly. This may ring a bell for those of you who have studied our\npayment system today. The debate in the early 1900s was different, of course,\nfocusing on the processing of checks. Advocates for reform liked to cite an\nexample involving an actual check that was written out of a bank in Sag Harbor,\n2\n\n\fLong Island, New York, and deposited in a bank in Hoboken, New Jersey, only\n100 miles away. To receive the payment, the bank in Hoboken sent the check to\nits correspondent bank in New York City. But its correspondent did not deal\ndirectly with the bank in Sag Harbor, so it sent the check along to another bank it\npartnered with. This continued, and in defiance of all sensibility, the check\ntraveled to eight more banks—in Boston, Tonawanda, Albany, Port Jefferson,\nFar Rockaway, back to New York City, Riverhead, and Brooklyn—before finally\nreaching its destination in Sag Harbor. The point of that 1,500-mile journey was\nto avoid fees imposed on check processing by working through existing banking\nrelationships, but this caused a considerable delay. This is the problem of\n“circuitous check routing,” as it was known.1\nI am sure that fintech innovators could have thought of many ways to improve on\nthat system, which sounds inefficient and a little absurd. And as a monetary\npolicymaker, I can think of several things that might have concerned me.\nUltimately, monetary policy is intended to create financial conditions that promote\nthe ability of businesses and households to make good use of the economy’s\nproductive resources. Long gaps in the ability to access payments could impair\nliquidity, for both households and businesses, as well as for the banks\nthemselves. Circuitous check routing seemed like a sign of inefficiency in\nfinancial technology that could get in the way of the macroeconomy functioning at\n\n1\n\nSpahr (1926, pp. 105–106).\n\n3\n\n\ffull potential. Finally, a payment system with so many points of failure raised\nquestions about how resilient it would be in times of stress.\nNow, scholars have debated whether examples like that 1,500-mile journey were\ncherry-picked by advocates for payment system reform. That may well have\nbeen the case. Nevertheless, scholars have also viewed the creation of the Fed\nas having substantially sped up check clearing and reduced the costs associated\nwith it. One of the Fed’s early key accomplishments was the creation of a\nnational check-clearing system. The national scope of this system largely\neliminated the need to route checks around the country, at least for banks that\nwere members of the Federal Reserve System, as they could simply use the\nnearest Federal Reserve branch. In addition, the Fed used a telegraph network\nto increase the speed of check clearing, particularly on the back-end. Once the\ncheck was in the Fed’s possession, it would credit the appropriate account and\ntelegraph out that information. Lastly, the Fed insisted on clearing of checks at\npar—something many banks had resisted as their business models depended on\nfees from check processing. Overall, in a short time, from 1912 to 1918, check\nclearing sped up from an average of 5.3 days to 2.4 days, and was largely at par.\nThis was a major change.2\nClearly, the Fed has had a long-standing interest in improving the speed and\nresilience of the U.S. payments infrastructure. That interest continues, and the\nFed is currently embarking on a major new initiative to deliver real-time\n\n2\n\nQuinn and Roberds (2008), James and Weiman (2010), Chang et al. (2008), and Gilbert (2000).\n\n4\n\n\fpayments. I will discuss this initiative, known as FedNowSM, a little bit later.\nNotably, the Fed has not sought to displace existing payments infrastructure. At\nthe time of its founding, for example, the Fed’s check-processing system\ncontinued to operate alongside private-sector systems run by correspondent\nbanks and clearinghouses. Today, the Federal Reserve continues to serve a\nprominent role in the payment system as a provider alongside private operators\nof financial services. Moreover, the Chicago Fed has had a long-standing role in\nleading Federal Reserve System initiatives in payment services. Staff in Chicago\nmanage the System’s Customer Relations and Support Office and oversee\nFedLine®—the network through which U.S. financial institutions connect to the\nFed for services such as wire transfers, automated clearinghouse (ACH)\ntransactions, and cash processing. Chicago Fed staff also manage relationships\nwith these banks and oversee the System’s Industry Relations function, which\nfacilitates industry engagement and collaboration on payments.\nOne key lesson I take from payments innovation at the time of the Fed’s founding\nis that the pace of change can be unpredictable. Rarely does a single invention\nresult in sweeping reform. Instead, major productivity improvements in economic\nhistory have been driven by the accumulation of incremental changes, with their\nadoption shaped by compatibility with existing practices.3 The telegraph, for\nexample, certainly existed before the Fed. However, its use in payments was\nlimited by the high fixed cost of operating a nationwide telegraph network, as well\nas the inability of private banks to impose consistent operating standards. The\n\n3\n\nRosenberg (1982).\n\n5\n\n\fFed played an important role in shaping the adoption of payments technology—in\nthis case the telegraph—in part by creating an appropriate institutional setting for\nit to be adopted.\nThe payment system has evolved considerably since the age of the telegraph,\nalongside improvements in communications and computing. Today, payments\nare an active area of innovation—one part of the broad umbrella known as\nfintech. I would like to turn my attention now to a few recent developments in\nfintech. I will focus in particular on cryptocurrencies and then come back to the\nsubject of payments and discuss the FedNow initiative.\nCryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies have blossomed over the past decade. Since the introduction\nof Bitcoin in 2008, investors have purchased thousands of such currencies.\nToday, the market capitalization of all digital currencies is estimated to be over\n$200 billion.4 It is clear there is an appetite for cryptocurrency. For some,\ncryptocurrencies represent a potential break from established banking and\npayments infrastructure. Other users value anonymity and, therefore, the ability\nto conceal their identities in cryptocurrency transactions. Merchants may be\nattracted by opportunities to avoid costs incurred with existing payment options—\n\n4\n\nDetails on the estimate from CoinMarketCap are available online,\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#total-market-capitalization. CoinMarketCap tracks cryptocurrencies\nand the markets in which they trade.\n\n6\n\n\fsuch as interchange fees in debit and credit card transactions. Many others are\nsimply speculating on the values of these cryptocurrencies.\nThe policy implications of cryptocurrencies are fascinating and evolving. As an\nasset in the global financial system, cryptocurrencies seem to be still a fairly\nsmall development. As a means of payment, the potential use of\ncryptocurrencies could have important implications for the financial system and\nfor monetary policy, if a significant share of payments activity shifted into\ncryptocurrencies. In such a scenario, the business models of commercial banks\ncould come under significant pressure. In addition, it is an open question whether\nsignificant use of private digital currencies could alter the ability of the Federal\nReserve to implement monetary policy through its existing toolkit.\nThus far, however, cryptocurrencies have largely been used as vehicles for\nspeculation rather than as a means of payment. For these digital currencies to\nhave more wide-reaching effects on the macroeconomy, they would likely have\nto overcome some barriers to adoption. One such barrier is the instability of their\nvalues. For example, the price of Bitcoin was roughly $3,500 at the beginning of\n2019, over $13,000 in June, and as of last week, back down to around $9,000. In\naddition, transaction speeds have been slow—a Bitcoin transaction could take\nanywhere from minutes to over an hour. The line at Starbucks would move even\nmore slowly if we had to wait for that. Some scholars doubt that a privately\nissued currency can ever serve as a reliable means of exchange given these\nfactors, together with the inherent default risk associated with the absence of any\ngovernment or institutional backing. These barriers illustrate a theme I touched\n7\n\n\fon a few minutes ago—that innovation often occurs through incremental changes\nthat are shaped by the compatibility of new ideas with existing ones. Blockchain\nand digital currencies constitute a major single invention, but one with some\nbarriers to adoption that subsequent innovators have been attempting to address\nin a myriad of ways. Some of these attempts probably don’t have much future:\nAmong the thousands of cryptocurrencies, the Bananacoin, for example, doesn’t\nseem ripe for a breakthrough.5 But others that are geared toward addressing\nsome of the key barriers to wider adoption that I just mentioned may have more\npromise.\nStablecoins\nThis brings me to a second development, the emergence of stablecoins—that is,\ncryptocurrencies that peg their value to target the price of a real-world asset.\nThese currencies are designed to address the price stability shortcomings that\nhave inhibited the wider adoption of digital currencies for use cases that require a\nstable medium of exchange, such as payments.\nStill, no stablecoin offers the network breadth that would be necessary to function\nas a medium of exchange. This, in part, has been why Facebook’s\nannouncement of plans to create the cryptocurrency Libra has gathered\nwidespread attention. With a network of almost two and a half billion active\nmonthly users and growing, Facebook would potentially provide Libra with a\n\n5\n\nBananacoin is a utility token designed to crowdfund expansion of a banana operation in Laos.\n\n8\n\n\fhuge user base.6 But legislators, regulators, and central bankers have been\nquick to highlight the risks, along with the need for more details about how Libra\nwill function. It is critical to assess Libra’s potential impact on users and the\nfinancial system, as well as how it can be effectively regulated on a global scale.\nFacebook’s past missteps on user privacy and security raise serious questions\naround user protection. Central banks have called for more clarity over how the\nunderlying Libra Reserve will function and what the makeup of currencies\nbacking the value of Libra will be. In his July 2019 testimony to the House\nFinancial Services Committee, Fed Chair Powell highlighted our concerns about\nLibra, particularly around consumer privacy and protection, the risks of money\nlaundering, and the need to assess its impact on broader financial stability.7 With\nthis increase in unfavorable regulatory and congressional attention, the Libra\nAssociation—the group founded to fund Libra and provide oversight over it—has\nseen an exodus of original founding partners, including PayPal, Visa, and\nMastercard.\nCentral bank digital currencies\nThus far, digital currency innovation has largely been the product of privatesector efforts. A central bank digital currency could conceivably address some of\nthe barriers to widespread use that I noted earlier. A central bank’s nationwide\n\n6\n\nAs of September 2019, Facebook statistics show the social media service has 1.63 billion daily active\nusers and 2.45 billion monthly active users. Details are available online,\nhttps://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/.\n7\nSome of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on July 10,\n2019, is quoted in Schroeder and Hunnicutt (2019). The webcast of his full testimony is available online,\nhttps://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403999#Wbcast03222017.\n\n9\n\n\freach could spur widespread adoption, and government backing could ensure\nthe currency would be default free.\nA small number of central banks around the world have experimented with\nissuing digital currencies, particularly for the purpose of cross-border payments.\nDespite these experiments, few central banks have immediate plans for broad\nimplementation.8 Likewise, the Federal Reserve is not actively considering\nissuing a digital currency, but continues to monitor other central banks and\nengage with them to remain current on issues and plans.\nSome scholars have suggested that a central bank digital currency could provide\nadditional tools for central bankers’ toolkit. In particular, new tools could be useful\nin situations where conventional monetary policy has been exhausted and shortterm interest rates have reached the effective lower bound. For example, a\ncentral bank could conceivably impose a negative interest rate on the digital\ncurrency or carry out a metaphorical helicopter drop of new money supply to all\nexisting holders. Such tools raise some immediate questions, such as how a\ncentral bank would manage outflows from the digital currency in the presence of\nnegative rates. These questions are in addition to the profound operational and\ntechnical challenges that any central bank would need to address in launching a\ndigital currency, as well as other concerns such as how existing financial\ninstitutions would be affected by such a currency.9\n\n8\n9\n\nBarontini and Holden (2019).\nPrasad (2018) and Bordo and Levin (2019).\n\n10\n\n\fBlockchain technology\nOutside of digital currencies, blockchain technology has other potential uses. For\nexample, blockchain is gaining traction as a means of tracking inventory or\nprovenance. For example, blockchain has enabled suppliers and retailers to track\nproducts like milk and meat from origin to consumers—in other words, “from farm\nto fork.” In addition, global banks and groups of private firms are testing the\ntechnology and its capacity to allow for group monitoring and public tracking of\ncontractual agreements, also known as “smart contracts.” Thus far, however, the\nuse of blockchain to trade financial information and assets has been largely\nlimited to pilot experiments where participation is strictly limited, such as Chase’s\nnetwork in which a small number of corporate clients can transfer funds between\neach other using the JPM Coin. Large, decentralized, or “permissionless” public\nblockchains face implementation and regulatory barriers, as well as challenges in\nscaling up. They also require a high bar for data privacy and protection.\nOther technologies on the fintech spectrum\nOf course, cryptocurrencies are not the only fintech development shaping\npayments, banking, regulation, and the financial ecosystem.\nArtificial intelligence (AI), with its capabilities for pattern recognition and\nprediction, is being used for a host of processes and tasks in finance and\nbanking. Banks and technology firms deploy AI for monitoring fraud, identifying\nbreach points, and automating customer support tools. Additionally, AI has the\npotential to automate regulatory and compliance activities while incorporating\n11\n\n\fmore data for both regulators and regulated institutions. At the Chicago Fed, we\nare exploring AI projects to support core work in economic research, bank\nsupervision, and internal business processes—similar to the ways banks and\ntheir technology vendors are exploring the use of AI to gain efficiencies and new\ninsights.\nWhile artificial intelligence and machine learning can introduce efficiencies, this is\nan area where caution and a clear understanding of the risks are critical. Given\nthat tasks such as underwriting and credit scoring rely on broader sets of data\nand algorithms to support lending decisions, financial institutions will need to\nfrequently examine the impact of this approach. Responsible AI fundamentals\nare necessary to ensure that unintended bias that could have an adverse effect\non borrowers and access to credit is addressed.\nReal-time payments and FedNow\nI would like to shift gears now and turn to current plans for innovation in the U.S.\npayment system. Here I see the Federal Reserve as a leader in promoting\ninnovation both to speed up payments and to ensure resilience of the U.S.\npayment system.\nEven with the all of the advances in computing and communications technologies\nover the past few decades, the U.S. payment system still relies heavily on\ndecades-old infrastructure. Indeed, real-time payments are generally unavailable\nin the U.S. As a result, a bill payment made by a consumer online can still take\nmultiple days to post and settle. Contract workers who are not part of a regular\n12\n\n\fpayroll could face delays in collecting their wages. Real-time payments offer the\npotential for people to gain access to money they earned immediately. For\nliquidity-constrained households, access to real-time payments could mean\navoiding late fees, as well as potentially faster access to ad hoc payments like\ninsurance payouts. For small businesses, immediate access to funds from a sale\nwould provide the ability to invest in inventory more quickly, avoiding costly shortterm financing. For contract workers, having immediate access and certainty of\nfunds provides predictability and reduces risk.\nThe demand for faster payments and the possibility of increasing efficiency with\nsuch payments have inspired innovation by private actors. However, these\ninnovations still rely on legacy infrastructure that involves delays—whether those\ndelays are visible to end-users or not. For example, popular person-to-person\npayment services, such as Venmo and Zelle, actually mask back-end processes.\nAs a result, even as funds may be available immediately, interbank settlement\ncan take days. Many cryptocurrency trades also often rely on existing settlement\ninfrastructure. Moreover, current innovations have had only limited reach. Checks\noften remain a desirable method of choice because they carry some enduring\nadvantages for businesses and households that want to track their spending or\ninclude identifying information along with a payment, such as a purchase order\nnumber.\nIn August, the Federal Reserve announced plans to develop the FedNow\nservice—a new, round-the-clock real-time payment and settlement service.\nFedNow will be accessible to all financial institutions and will leverage the\n13\n\n\fFederal Reserve System’s connections with over 10,000 financial institutions\nacross the U.S. This is a reach no single private-sector provider would be able to\nachieve on its own.\nThe goal of FedNow is to ensure efficiency and resiliency and broaden reach\nwhile operating in healthy competition with private-sector providers of real-time\npayments. The Fed’s participation in real-time payments will ensure redundancy\nand reduce the risk of a single point of failure, and will also allow us to continue\nto serve the important role of providing liquidity and operational continuity in\ntimes of stress in real-time payments.\nThe move to faster payments has been a global goal. Other central banks and\njurisdictions are in varying stages of development and market adoption of faster\npayment services. The U.S. has avoided mandates, primarily because of the size\nof our economy, our banking infrastructure, and our market-driven system for\nfinancial services. Instead, the U.S. has largely relied upon market-driven\ninnovation and joint public–private collaboration to deliver advancements in\npayment services.\nThe decision to build FedNow has been several years in the making, and is the\nculmination of extensive industry engagement, market assessment, and dialogue\nwith a diverse range of stakeholders. In 2015, the Federal Reserve released a\npaper titled “Strategies for improving the U.S. payment system.” This paper\noutlined the Fed’s broad commitment to modernizing the U.S. payment system. It\nalso described the industry’s desire to achieve positive outcomes involving faster\n\n14\n\n\fpayment speed, system security, improvement of international payments,\nindustry collaboration, and payment system efficiency.10 The Federal Reserve\nthen led an effort to bring stakeholders in the payment system together to\nestablish a vision for a faster payment system in the United States. The Faster\nPayments Task Force included a wide range of payment system stakeholders\nincluding providers, banks, consumer groups, corporations, and others.11 The\nTask Force finalized their work in 2017. It issued ten recommended actions\nintended to deliver a safe, ubiquitous, faster payment ecosystem facilitated\nthrough industry-driven governance and collaboration. Two of these\nrecommendations focused on the Fed’s role in faster payments. The first called\nfor the Federal Reserve to expand settlement windows to 24-7; and the second\ncalled on the Fed to assess other operational roles it may need to take to support\nthe ubiquity of faster payments, competition in delivering them, and equitable\naccess to them.12\nAs a result of these recommendations, the Federal Reserve conducted extensive\noutreach and sought public feedback on the potential to expand the Fed’s role as\nan operator of real-time payments. A Federal Register notice requesting\ncomments on the potential introduction of a faster payment settlement service\ngenerated over 400 responses representing 800 entities. Over 90 percent of\nthose responses indicated support for the Fed offering a settlement service for\n\n10\n\nFederal Reserve System (2015).\nDetails on the Faster Payments Task Force are available online, https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/.\n12\nThe goals and recommendations of the Faster Payments Task Force are available online,\nhttps://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/goals-and-recommendations/.\n11\n\n15\n\n\ffaster payments. Responses highlighted the importance of safety and security in\nfaster payments, noting the Fed’s record of resiliency, especially during periods\nof stress. Another theme from the comments was that the Fed would ensure\nnationwide, equitable access to banks of all sizes by operating a real-time\nservice for faster payments alongside a private-sector system. And finally,\ncomments noted that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service would\nincrease competition, decrease market concentration, and provide a neutral\nplatform for innovation. The announcement of the FedNow service followed a\nclose review of these supportive comments. In addition, the Fed gave careful\nconsideration to the broad public benefit of faster payments; the Fed’s ability to\nfully recover costs; and whether the private sector on its own could achieve faster\npayments with adequate scope, equity, and effectiveness.\nResiliency of the payment system\nReal-time payments aren’t about speed alone. The payment system must also be\nresilient in the face of financial stress. Central banks are a classic source of such\nresiliency. For example, as a lender of last resort, the Fed has the unique\ncapacity to expand total liquidity in the financial system. This is crucial in times of\nstress when the overall demand for liquidity increases. The history of payments is\nfilled with examples of private-sector innovation, but also with examples of the\nfragility of privately run payment systems. For example, scholars have found that\none source of fragility during the Great Depression was the privately run\ncorrespondent banking system, that is, the system used mostly by non-Fedmember banks to clear payments. The failure of a correspondent bank during the\n16\n\n\fGreat Depression resulted in a cascade of additional failures among its partner\nbanks, known as respondents.13 Another example comes from the aftermath of\nthe September 11th terrorist attacks. Communications interruptions in lower\nManhattan led to disruption in payment flows.14 Sometimes fragility is more\nidiosyncratic. One well-known example is a computer failure in 1985 at a large\nNew York bank, which has a central role in clearing transactions among financial\ninstitutions. The computer failure resulted in the inability of Bank of New York\nMellon to receive any payments, leading to knock-on disruptions in the securities\nmarkets in which it had a large role.15 In the face of potential disruptions such as\nthese to private real-time payment systems, the FedNow platform will provide an\nimportant source of redundancy and resiliency. By ensuring the system is secure\nand resilient, FedNow will engender confidence in the use of real-time payments.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, financial technology has come a long way since checks journeyed\nhundreds of miles around the country. Central banks have had an important role\nin promoting this innovation, and indeed the Fed continues to innovate alongside\nprivate-sector actors. These are exciting times, and I look forward to seeing what\nthe future will bring.\n\n13\n\nRichardson (2007).\nFerguson (2002).\n15\nEnnis and Price (2015).\n14\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\nBarontini, Christian, and Henry Holden, 2019, “Proceeding with caution—a\nsurvey on central bank digital currency,” Bank for International Settlements,\nMonetary and Economic Department, BIS paper, No. 101, January, available\nonline, https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap101.htm.\nBordo, Michael D., and Andrew T.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nFed Listens:\nMonetary Policy’s Impact on\nWorkers and Their Communities\nChicago, IL\nOctober 17, 2019\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fWelcome and Introduction\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction and disclaimer\nWelcome to Chicago. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed.\nWe’re very happy to be hosting this important discussion of Monetary Policy’s\nImpact on Workers and Their Communities. Before I begin my remarks, let me\nremind you that my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily the\nviews of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework review\nThis year, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in a broad review of the\nstrategies, tools, and communication practices it uses to pursue its monetary\npolicy goals as mandated by Congress—namely, maximum employment and\nprice stability.1\nOur current framework dates back to 2012 when we formally stated our intention\nto pursue a balanced approach to achieving our dual mandate objectives. That’s\nalso when our inflation objective was explicitly defined to be 2 percent annual\ninflation, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption\n\n1\n\nFor more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate.\n\n2\n\n\fExpenditures (PCE).2 We also noted then that defining maximum employment\nwas more difficult because it can change over time due to influences beyond our\ncontrol as monetary policymakers. But we did note the range of our assessments\nof the level of the national unemployment rate in the long run—which can be\ntaken as a rough benchmark for full employment.\nEvery January, we reaffirm this framework. Sometimes we’ve made some\nchanges to improve it—most importantly in 2016, when we clarified that our\ninflation objective is symmetric around 2 percent.3 This strategy document then\nguides our detailed policy decisions, which we describe in a separate policy\nstatement after every FOMC meeting.\nI think our 2012 strategy statement and its updates were strong efforts. Still, it is\nappropriate that we periodically reexamine our strategy thoroughly to determine\nwhether it still serves us well in light of changes that may have occurred in the\neconomic environment. Clear communications to the public about our goals and\nstrategies bring transparency and accountability to monetary policy, which is very\nimportant for a central bank in a democracy.\nSo, late last year, Chair Jay Powell announced that we would be conducting a\nbroad review of our policy framework. And this time, we are getting more input\nfrom people outside the Federal Reserve System. In June, the Chicago Fed\nhosted a meeting that featured many prominent academics applying highly\n\n2\n3\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2012).\nFederal Open Market Committee (2016).\n\n3\n\n\fmathematical analyses that help us understand how different monetary policy\nstrategies might work.\nBut it also very important for us to get input from beyond traditional economic\nanalysts and the financial sector. I always think it is important to check theoretical\nideas with real-world experiences. Talking with people engaged in important,\nreal-world work, such as those on today’s panels, to find out how they are\naffected by monetary policy is an important source of insights into how we should\ndo our work at the Fed.\nToday’s panels\nToday, we will have the opportunity to hear from a very impressive group of\npanelists and delve into some of the key issues in more depth.\nThe members of the first panel are committed to improving the labor market\nprospects of current and future workers. Their efforts, much of which are aimed\nat those who face substantial labor market disadvantages, help people build their\nworkforce skills and employability and ultimately earn higher incomes.\nThe participants in the second panel are working to promote wealth building,\nespecially in low- and moderate-income communities. Their work adds to the\nvibrancy and sustainability of small businesses and increases access to\naffordable housing.\n\n4\n\n\fThe efforts of our panelists to build human capital and create wealth where it is in\nshort supply are extremely important to making us a more productive nation over\nthe long haul. They also serve to promote a more inclusive economy by providing\ngreater support to those who face significant challenges in finding good jobs or\nachieving financial stability in today’s complex world.\nWhat we hope to learn\nThe work that our panelists do, like that of everyone in the economy, is\nimportantly affected by the Fed’s monetary policy. Our belief is that the objectives\nof our panelists are more achievable in an environment of price stability and\nmaximum employment. However, if they are not succeeding, we have to ask\nourselves if there’s something about macroeconomic conditions that is inhibiting\ntheir progress.\nFor instance, one of the key questions facing us today is whether the economy is\ncurrently operating at its maximum sustainable level of employment. Certainly,\nthe national unemployment rate is very low by historical standards. And at 3-1/2\npercent, it is below most estimates of the so-called natural rate of\nunemployment—the unemployment rate at which the economy can operate on a\nsustained basis without the buildup of unwelcome inflationary forces. Estimates\nof the natural rate tend to be 4 percent or a bit higher.\nHowever, even though economists put a lot of effort into estimating the natural\nrate, we’re very conscious of how uncertain those estimates remain. That is,\n5\n\n\fwhile something a little greater than 4 percent might be the best assessment\ngiven our limited data, we know the actual number might be somewhat higher or\nsomewhat lower. Certainly, wage growth has remained quite moderate, even\nthough we’ve been below conventional estimates of the natural rate for some\ntime. This suggests that, at a minimum, unemployment is not so far below its\nnatural rate that overly high inflation is an urgent threat. Indeed, inflation has\nbeen persistently below our 2 percent target over just about the whole time that\nwe’ve had that formal target.\nThis leads me to think that the Fed should continue to cautiously probe for the\ntrue level of maximum employment. That is, we shouldn’t treat a statistical\nestimate of the natural rate as a hard barrier that automatically signals an\nimpending problem. Of course, we should also be mindful of the possibility that\nunwelcome inflationary imbalances could yet emerge. We need to keep both\npossibilities in mind.\nAs part of our probing for the level of maximum employment, our panelists can\nprovide us with very useful evidence from the frontlines. Can people with skills\nfind good jobs? Is today’s environment one in which people can add to their skills\nand support greater future productivity? Do small business owners and housing\ndevelopers with good business plans have adequate access to capital in order to\nexpand their operations?\nIn addition to knowing current economic conditions very well, our panelists all\nhave a wealth of experience with varying economic conditions over the years.\n6\n\n\fThey’ve seen periods in which the economy has boomed, as well as times when\nit has gone through recession. They know the impact these cycles have on the\npeople they serve. I hope they’ll be able to tell us whether major ups and downs\nin the economy make it more difficult for them to achieve their objectives. Such\ninsights may have important implications for our choice of monetary policy\nstrategy.\nSo I’d like to thank all of our panelists for taking the time to come here today to\nshare their experiences and insights. I know we are going to have a very\ninteresting afternoon.\nNow I would like to introduce Governor Michelle Bowman. Governor Bowman is\none of the champions of this series of Fed Listens events. She has been\ntraveling all over the country to listen to community leaders such as yourselves.\nBefore I turn over the podium, I want to take the opportunity to tell you a bit about\nher.\nMiki Bowman took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System on November 26, 2018. Prior to her appointment, she served as\nthe state bank commissioner of Kansas from January 2017 to November 2018.\nShe also served as vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas from\n2010 to 2017.\nIn addition to her community banking experience, Miki has previous experience\nin Washington, DC. During the late ’90s, she worked for Senator Bob Dole of\n7\n\n\fKansas and served as a counsel to the U.S. House Committee on Transportation\nand Infrastructure and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. In\n2002, she became director of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency and later served as deputy assistant\nsecretary and policy advisor to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.\nFollowing her time in Washington, DC, Governor Bowman led a government and\npublic affairs consultancy based in London before returning to Kansas in 2010.\nMiki received a BS in advertising and journalism from the University of Kansas\nand a JD from the Washburn University School of Law.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. It’s good to get out of\nChicago and into the heartland. Yesterday, I met with business people from the\narea and heard their insights into the economy. Later this morning, I will be\ntouring the Jump Simulation facilities to learn about their efforts to transform\nhealth care. This promises to be very interesting.\nToday, I want to discuss my outlook for the economy and the appropriate stance\nfor monetary policy. In doing so, I will touch on some constraints on what\nmonetary policy can achieve and the importance of risk-management\nconsiderations in formulating policy. After my formal remarks, I’m looking forward\nto answering your questions and, importantly, to hearing your perspectives on\nthe economy. However, before continuing, let me remind you that my comments\nreflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n2\n\n\fThe Fed’s dual mandate\nTo set the stage, Congress has charged the Fed with adjusting financial\nconditions in order to promote 1) maximum sustainable employment and 2)\nstable prices for the goods and services we all purchase. These two goals are\nknown collectively as our “dual mandate.” They are coequal, and if a conflict\narises between the two, policy takes a balanced approach to achieving them both\nover time.\nTo judge how well we are performing on our mission, we need to be more\nspecific about these objectives.1 First, consider employment. The maximum\nsustainable level of employment is largely determined by demographics, worker\nskills, and other such factors that are independent of monetary policy. These\nfactors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. As a result,\nthe FOMC cannot specify a specific goal for maximum employment. Instead, we\nrely on a range of indicators to gauge the overall health of the labor market. One\nimportant indicator is the unemployment rate. And one way of measuring\nperformance on our employment mandate is to compare the unemployment rate\nto the rate that we would expect to see over the longer run in the absence of\n\n1\n\nFor more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate.\n\n3\n\n\feconomic disruptions. Currently, FOMC participants’ estimates of that long-run\nrate are in the neighborhood of 4.2 percent.2\nIn contrast to full employment, over the long run, the inflation rate is primarily\ndetermined by monetary policy. Therefore, the Committee has the ability to\nspecify a numerical goal for the inflation element of our dual mandate. We’ve\ndeclared it’s 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Furthermore, the Committee views\nthis target as being “symmetric,” meaning it would be concerned if inflation were\nrunning persistently above or below 2 percent. So this is the yardstick to use\nwhen gauging our performance in meeting our inflation objective.\nThe outlook\nWith these policy goals in mind, let me now turn to the economic outlook.\nOver the past year and a half, the U.S. economy has expanded at a solid 2-1/2\npercent annual rate on average. One feature over this time has been generally\nstrong consumer expenditures. This performance should carry forward in the\nnear term given the support of good fundamentals—namely, healthy household\n\n2\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee (2019).\n\n4\n\n\fbalance sheets; elevated consumer confidence; and, most notably, a vibrant\nlabor market.\nAt 3-1/2 percent, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low and obviously below\nthe 4.2 percent benchmark I mentioned earlier. As labor markets have tightened,\nwage growth—which had been anemic for many years—finally picked up last\nyear and has generally maintained a solid pace so far in 2019.\nImportantly, in the past, prosperity has often eluded those at the bottom of the\nincome distribution. In today’s vibrant labor markets, many who had been left\nbehind are gaining a welcome foothold into the job market—some for the first\ntime. Some are benefiting from increased on-the-job training or other programs\nemployers have instituted to meet their workforce needs in a tight market. Recent\nresearch provides evidence that the strong economy has improved the labor\nmarket outcomes for disadvantaged groups during this expansion, including\nboosting real wage growth for less educated workers to rates near those of their\ncollege-educated peers.3\nIn contrast to the consumer sector and the labor market, the business sector has\nseen some unfavorable changes. After posting robust gains in 2017 and much of\n\n3\n\nSee Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019), Aaronson et al. (2019), and Aaronson, Hu, and Rajan (2019).\n\n5\n\n\f2018, business fixed investment has lost considerable momentum.\nManufacturing output has declined, and business sentiment has faltered.\nSome of this softness is a consequence of weaker foreign demand for U.S.\nproducts, as growth in a number of advanced and emerging economies has\nslowed over the past year and a half.4 Furthermore, higher tariffs, the ebb and\nflow of trade tensions, heightened geopolitical risks, and concerns over an even\nmore pronounced and prolonged slowdown abroad have introduced a good deal\nof uncertainty into business decision-making.5\nA natural reaction to this uncertainty is to pull back on expansion plans. An\nincreasing number of my business contacts—particularly those in manufacturing\nor ones with a large international footprint—are telling me about delayed or\ncanceled investment projects, and a few have mentioned downsizing workforce\nplans. And, of course, tariffs and other possible trade disruptions pose a threat to\nsupply chains and business relationships, prompting some firms to reevaluate\nthese elements of their business models.\n\n4\n\nFor instance, since late 2018, the International Monetary Fund has reduced its forecast of world growth\nover the next three years by as much as one-half of a percentage point. See International Monetary Fund\n(2018, 2019).\n5\nIndeed, uncertainty indexes based on keyword searches of news accounts—such as the economic policy\nuncertainty (EPU) index by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) and the trade policy uncertainty (TPU) index by\nCaldara et al. (2019)—at times reached historically high levels over the past year.\n\n6\n\n\fPutting together all of these developments, I expect the U.S. economy to grow a\ntouch above 2 percent this year, as continued strength in consumer spending\noffsets weakness in business outlays and net exports. Growth is clearly slowing:\nIn 2018, economic activity expanded 2-1/2 percent, and the year before it rose 23/4 percent. But 2 percent is not far from my staff’s estimate of the economy’s\nlong-run potential growth rate, which is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. So my\noutlook has the economy chugging along at or a bit above its long-run trend.\nLooking beyond this year, I expect growth to continue to run roughly in line with\npotential. In this environment, I anticipate the unemployment rate to remain close\nto its current low level for some time—and thus below that long-run benchmark of\n4.2 percent.\nWhat about inflation—the other half of our dual mandate? Well, inflation had\nbeen running below our symmetric 2 percent objective throughout most of the\nrecovery. Then, in 2018, inflation rose back to 2 percent. But this improvement\nproved to be relatively short-lived, as core PCE inflation subsequently slipped to\n1-1/2 percent in early 2019, and only recently has recovered to 1.8 percent.6 In\nanother unwelcome development, by some measures inflation expectations—\n\n6\n\nWhile our inflation objective is stated in terms of overall inflation according to the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy\nsectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n\n7\n\n\fwhich are a key determinant of actual inflation—have slipped further this year\nand today are at uncomfortably low levels.\nMy forecast looks for inflation to move up slowly and then modestly overshoot\nour 2 percent target a couple years down the road. Now, I have been forecasting\nthis inflation path for some time. The same is true of the outlook for growth I just\nmentioned. However, I now think that achieving these outcomes will require more\naccommodative monetary policy than I did in the past—indeed, more\naccommodation than I thought necessary just this last December. This change\nreflects what I like to refer to as an outcome-based approach to monetary policy.\nThis approach entails adjusting the stance of policy not according to some simple\nstatic rule, but in whatever way is necessary to achieve our mandated goals on a\ntimely basis while effectively managing the various risks to the outlook.\nSo what has happened since last December? Well, as I just discussed, some\ndata on economic activity came in weaker, downside risks multiplied, and\ninflation and inflation expectations retreated. Consequently, I now think a more\naccommodative stance is needed to support a roughly similar growth outlook\nand, importantly, to support moving inflation and inflation expectations up with\ngreater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2 percent goal sustainably and\nwithin a reasonable time. So, I think the two 25-basis-point cuts the Fed made\nthis year in the target range for the federal funds rate—which is our primary\npolicy tool—were quite appropriate.\n8\n\n\fI think policy probably is in a good place right now. All told, the growth outlook is\ngood, and we have policy accommodation in place to support rising inflation.\nThat said, there is some risk that the economy will have more difficulty navigating\nall the uncertainties out there or that unexpected downside shocks might hit. So\nthere is an argument for more accommodation now to provide some further riskmanagement buffer against these potential events. I am keeping an open mind to\nthese arguments, which I’m sure we will discuss fully at our meeting later this\nmonth. Of course, we obviously would act aggressively if actually faced with an\nimminent downturn.\nTurning to the expected policy path further ahead, I’d note that in September the\nmedian FOMC participant saw no additional change in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate through the end of 2020 and one 25-basis-point increase in\neach of 2021 and 2022. My own assessment is pretty much in line with this\nmedian outlook.7\nLimits to what monetary policy can accomplish\nAs I’ve just described, over the course of this year I have adjusted my policy path\nin a way I see as most likely to yield economic outcomes consistent with our dual\n\n7\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee (2019).\n\n9\n\n\fmandate objectives. However, beyond such adjustments, we need to\nacknowledge that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can accomplish.\nMy outlook recognizes that the economy faces a number of important challenges\ntoday—difficult trade negotiations over important long-term disagreements,\nslowing foreign growth, and uncertainty weighing on domestic demand. These\nare the types of problems that monetary policy is able to address to some\ndegree, as more accommodative financial conditions can provide an offsetting\nboost to weakening aggregate demand. Furthermore, inflation is below target;\nand as theory tells us so forcefully, in the end, it’s the monetary actions of central\nbanks that determine the inflation rate.\nThat said, there are limits to what monetary policy can accomplish. An important\nreason is constraints on our capacity to cut policy rates in the event of a serious\ndownturn. Notably, these constraints arise largely because we also face longerterm structural issues that monetary policy has little impact on, but nonetheless\nhave important implications for central banks. Altogether, these factors point to\nan environment of lower trend growth and lower interest rates that is likely to\npersist for years. My colleagues and I have spoken in depth about these issues,\nso I will be brief in explaining them today.\nAn economy’s long-run growth rate is constrained by its productive capacity—it’s\na speed limit of sorts; you can exceed it for brief periods, but not forever. That\n10\n\n\fcapacity depends on the economy’s available labor resources and on the\nproductivity of that labor. Unfortunately, shifting demographics in the U.S. and\nmost other advanced economies are lowering the growth in labor input:\nPopulations are aging, and the U.S. labor force participation rate has been on a\ndowntrend for nearly 20 years.\nAlong with slower labor force growth, we have also experienced slower growth in\nlabor productivity. Improvements in labor quality—that is, gains in education and\nworker experience—are no longer adding much to productivity. Business\ninvestment has been relatively soft during this expansion, so that capital used by\nthe workforce has increased only modestly. Likewise, despite widespread gains\nin technology, we’ve seen only modest growth in something economists call total\nfactor productivity, which reflects how well we put various inputs together to\nproduce output.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean that important innovations aren’t happening. I’m\nsure my tour here later today will reveal some promising advances in health care\nthat are being developed locally.\nYet today, when my research staff does the arithmetic, they put the underlying\nannual trend pace of growth in labor hours at one-half percent and that for labor\nproductivity at 1-1/4 percent. This puts the long-run sustainable growth rate for\nthe economy as a whole at about 1-3/4 percent. By comparison, potential growth\n11\n\n\faveraged roughly around 3 percent in the 20 years before the global financial\ncrisis.\nToday’s uncertain and hostile trade climate may weigh further on this number.\nThis is because trade fosters cross-border competition among businesses, which\nin turn leads to productivity enhancement and innovation. Conversely, insulation\nfrom international market forces typically reduces a business enterprise’s\nmotivation to innovate, as it faces less competition. So trend growth could be\neven lower than the estimate I just cited.8\nThese long-term trends have enormous implications for standards of living. But\nthere is little monetary policy can do about them; it can’t affect demographics and\nat best has a second- or third-order impact on productivity trends. Other kinds of\npolicies can address some of these factors, such as by ensuring a well-educated\nworkforce, but these are the responsibility of other branches of government.\nThat said, these trends influence the monetary policymaking environment a great\ndeal. Economic theory tells us that as the potential growth rate of the economy\ndeclines, so does the equilibrium level of real interest rates; this is the rate\nconsistent with full employment of the economy’s productive resources and is\n\n8\n\nFurthermore, if there were an increase in restrictions on legal immigration and related actions on\nundocumented immigration, then the growth in trend labor hours would be weaker.\n\n12\n\n\foften referred to as real r*. To get to the federal funds rate that is neither\ncontractionary nor expansionary—the so-called equilibrium federal funds rate—\nyou need to add our 2 percent inflation target to real r*. Today, the median\nestimate of my colleagues on the FOMC for that rate is 2-1/2 percent. That is\nsignificantly below the median participant’s evaluation of over 4 percent just a\nfew years ago.9 It is also below the 5 percent or so rate in the early 2000s, as\nestimated by some models.10\nSimply put, a lower equilibrium rate means a smaller capacity for monetary policy\nto counteract negative shocks to the economy. In the past, policymakers were\nable to provide 500 basis points of accommodation on average during an easing\ncycle. Today, if circumstances demand it, there is far less room to cut the federal\nfunds rate before it reaches the neighborhood of zero—what we refer to as the\neffective lower bound on rates, or ELB. The FOMC would then be forced to turn\nto less effective tools to provide the necessary accommodation, making it more\ndifficult to achieve our mandated policy goals. The calculus is even more\nchallenging if we fail to meet our 2 percent inflation objective, as nominal interest\n\n9\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2012).\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest, report, available online,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar.\n10\n\n13\n\n\frates would settle out at an even lower level. That’s why meeting our inflation\nobjective is especially important.\nRisk management in a low-growth environment\nEarlier, I mentioned risk management as one rationale for rate cuts in the current\nenvironment.11 History has many other examples of the FOMC preemptively\nadjusting rates to mitigate risks.12\nWhat does risk management actually mean? It entails thinking about what could\ngo wrong with the forecast and then judging if policy should be adjusted from the\nbaseline one way or the other in light of the alternative scenarios. This evaluation\nconsiders whether the costs from missing our dual mandate objectives are\nbalanced across these alternatives. If not, we may want to adjust policy as\ninsurance against bad outcomes.\nToday, the low r* environment makes risk management a very important\nconsideration in charting the course for monetary policy. The practical limits it\nimposes on the capacity to cut the federal funds rate means that downside\n\n11\n\nSee Powell (2019). The three reasons given were to mitigate the depressing effects of international\ndevelopments on U.S. growth; to manage downside risks to the economy; and to support the return of\ninflation to our 2 percent symmetric target.\n12\nSee Evans et al. (2015) for an analysis of risk management in monetary policy. The authors found\nevidence of risk management in about one-third of the 128 FOMC meetings between 1993 and 2008. Not\nall of these resulted in policy being more accommodative than it otherwise would have been; about onequarter of the occurrences seemed to be associated with tighter policy.\n\n14\n\n\fshocks that weaken growth or inflation could be more costly than upside\nsurprises we could more easily react to by raising rates. To avoid becoming\nstranded at the effective lower bound, risk management calls for proactively\ncutting rates in response to increased downside risks. The extra accommodation\nprovides a buffer for the economy to absorb the bad shocks should they occur. It\nalso is useful in communicating to the public that we are aware of the risks and\nare unlikely to be caught off guard should they materialize.\nBeyond the near-term risk factors I discussed earlier, the broader inflation\noutlook also poses an important risk-management consideration.\nThink about setting policy to return inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal on a\nsustainable basis. The risks here are not symmetric. With today’s low inflation, if\nwe apply too much accommodation, inflation will simply reach our target sooner.\nBut if we fail to act strongly enough, we risk underlying inflation trends and\ninflation expectations becoming mired at low levels, making it all the more difficult\nto achieve our goal. This could occur, for example, if the public perceives that our\n2 percent inflation goal is a ceiling, rather than the symmetric target that it is.\nIn my view, these differences mean we need to err on the side of providing\naggressive enough accommodation to get inflation moving up with some\nmomentum. After all, no one ever made a free throw without enough muscle\nbehind it to first get the ball to the hoop. This kind of force could well result in\n15\n\n\finflation modestly overrunning 2 percent for some time. But in the current\nsituation, this would not be a policy error. Engineering a modest overshoot of our\ninflation objective better guarantees that we would actually meet our inflation\ntarget in the future. Any excessive overshooting could be controlled with modest\nrate hikes. Moreover, tolerating inflation as high as 2-1/2 percent does not entail\nmuch of a welfare loss—especially given the lengthy undershoot we’ve\npermitted. This is because for me, more generally, symmetry means paying\nattention to both past and prospective misses from our target to ensure that\ninflation averages 2 percent over the long haul.\nConclusion\nIn sum, although our policy goals remain constant, our policy tactics must evolve\nto keep pace with economic developments. As I have for some time, I advocate\nfollowing an outcome-based approach to monetary policy that aims to achieve\nour dual mandate goals on a timely basis while effectively managing various risks\nto the outlook. Over the past ten months—as the forces affecting the U.S.\neconomy changed from tailwinds to headwinds and as we lost the inflation\nmomentum we had seemed to build—this outcome-based approach has dictated\na shift in my appropriate policy path. I see that the economy today is generally in\ngood shape and that policy is close to the right place, but there are risks that\nrequire our diligent attention. Looking ahead, I will continue to advocate for using\n\n16\n\n\four best tools to achieve our dual mandate goals in a timely manner. That is the\nbest way to achieve the job Congress has given the Federal Reserve.\nThank you.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, and Aastha Rajan, 2019, “Explaining variation in\nreal wage growth over the recent expansion,” Chicago Fed Letter, Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, No. 421, available online,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2019/421.\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. Before I begin my\nremarks, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\nToday, I’d like to share with you my perspective on the evolution of U.S.\nmonetary policy over the past ten months—from a time when some further\ngradual rate increases seemed to be in store to one in which cuts have been\nmade and rates are likely to remain low for some time. I also will talk about some\nlonger-run strategic monetary policy framework issues.\nBefore I go into detail about policy, for context, let me first provide a brief\nsummary of current macroeconomic conditions and my outlook for growth and\ninflation.\nOver the past year and a half, the U.S. economy has expanded at a solid 2-1/2\npercent annual rate on average. One constant over this time has been strong\nconsumer expenditures. The incoming data suggest this vitality should carry\nforward in the near term, reflecting healthy household balance sheets; elevated\nconsumer confidence; and, most notably, a vibrant labor market. At 3.7 percent,\n2\n\n\fthe unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Importantly, many who had been\nleft behind are gaining a welcome foothold into the job market—some for the first\ntime. As labor markets have tightened, wage growth—which had been anemic for\nmany years—finally picked up last year and has maintained a solid pace so far in\n2019.\nHowever, in contrast to the consumer sector, the business sector has seen some\nunfavorable changes. After posting robust gains last year, business fixed\ninvestment has lost considerable momentum over the past ten months.\nManufacturing output has declined, and business sentiment has deteriorated.\nSome of this softness is a consequence of weaker foreign growth reducing the\ndemand for U.S. products. Growth in a number of advanced and emerging\neconomies has slowed over the past two years, and most analysts have revised\ndown their forecasts for future growth.1 Furthermore, higher tariffs, the ebb and\nflow of trade tensions, heightened geopolitical risks, and concerns over an even\nmore pronounced and prolonged slowdown abroad have introduced a good deal\nof uncertainty into business decision-making.2 A natural reaction to this\nuncertainty is to pull back on expansion plans. An increasing number of my\nbusiness contacts—particularly those in the manufacturing sector or ones with a\nlarge international footprint—are telling me about delayed or canceled investment\n\n1\n\nFor instance, since late 2018, the International Monetary Fund has reduced its forecast of world growth\nover the next three years by as much as 0.5 percentage points. See International Monetary Fund (2018,\n2019).\n2\nIndeed, uncertainty indexes based on keyword searches of news accounts—such as the economic policy\nuncertainty (EPU) index by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) and the trade policy uncertainty (TPU) index by\nCaldara et al. (2019)—at times reached historically high levels over the past year.\n\n3\n\n\fprojects. In addition, I have heard reports of some firms downsizing workforce\nplans.\nPutting together all of these developments, I expect the U.S. economy to grow\nabout 2-1/4 percent this year, as continued strength in consumer spending\noffsets weakness in business outlays and net exports. This is a solid number, as\nit exceeds my view of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which is\nslightly below 2 percent. Looking beyond this year, I expect growth to run roughly\nin line with potential. In this environment, I anticipate the unemployment rate to\nremain close to its current level for some time.\nWhat about inflation? Well, inflation in the U.S. had been running below our\nsymmetric 2 percent objective throughout most of the recovery. Then, in 2018,\ninflation rose back to 2 percent. This was quite a welcome but relatively shortlived development, as inflation subsequently faltered over the first half of 2019,\nfalling to as low as 1-1/2 percent. Currently, core PCE inflation is 1.8 percent on\na 12-month basis.3 In 2018, I had been reluctant to declare victory and say that\nour below-target inflation worries were behind us. But undeniably, the\nenvironment at the time did seem much more favorable given the inflation\nimprovements we had seen and an expectation that they would continue amid a\nsolid outlook for growth. However, the disappointing inflation developments this\nyear suggest that more work is necessary. I do project that inflation will move up\n\n3\n\nWhile our inflation objective is stated in terms of overall inflation according to the Price Index for\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy\nsectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n\n4\n\n\fand then modestly overshoot our 2 percent target over the next few years; but\nthis requires aid from a more accommodative monetary policy path now than I\nthought appropriate in December.\nMy rationale for mid-cycle adjustments\nThe forecasts for economic activity and inflation in my September submission to\nthe Fed’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) actually are very\nclose to those I made at the end of 2018.4 Given all the developments in the U.S.\nand abroad over the past ten months, you might wonder why my projections\nhave not changed much; indeed, you might question whether I have been paying\nany attention to the news!\nWell, yes, I’ve been reading the news and crunching the data. (Well, at least I’ve\nhad my staff crunching the data.) The number one reason for this stability in my\noutlook is that, overall, the economic fundamentals remain solid. Most of the\nconcerns over growth are about potential risks that could be costly, but also may\nnever occur. That said, those risks appear somewhat more pronounced today.\nFurthermore, as I just noted, progress on inflation has been disappointing. Given\nthis assessment, I have altered my view for the appropriate path for policy rates\nin order to support an outlook for continued solid growth and to boost inflation. In\nother words, the adjustments were made in order to keep my baseline forecast\non a track to meet our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and\n\n4\n\nSee, for instance, Evans (2019).\n\n5\n\n\fsymmetric 2 percent inflation. This is a policy strategy I refer to as outcomebased monetary policy.\nAs you know, my colleagues on the FOMC have made similar adjustments to\ntheir projections for the economy and the appropriate path for policy. The\nCommittee has moved from 1) most participants in December 2018 expecting\ncontinued gradual increases in the policy rates through 2019–20 to 2) holding\nrates constant from January through June of this year in order to assess\ndevelopments and then, ultimately, to 3) the Committee cutting rates by 50 basis\npoints at the July and September meetings. Over this time the median path of the\nfederal funds rate projected forward by FOMC participants went from one of\ngradual increases to an essentially flat funds rate through the end of next year.\nChair Powell characterized the July rate cut as a “mid-cycle adjustment” to\npolicy—similar to the adjustments the FOMC had made in 1995 and 1998—and\nlaid out three reasons for the policy move: to mitigate the depressing effects of\ninternational developments on U.S. growth; to manage downside risks to the\neconomy; and to support the return of inflation to our 2 percent symmetric\ntarget.5\nTo appreciate the changes in views about appropriate policy, I need to first take\nyou back to the end of 2018.\n\n5\n\nSee Powell (2019).\n\n6\n\n\fAfter a series of very gradual rate increases in the previous three years, the\nFOMC raised the federal funds rate to the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in\nDecember 2018. I, along with most of my colleagues on the FOMC, thought at\nthe time that it would likely be appropriate to raise policy rates another two or\nthree times in 2019.6\nI thought this path was consistent with the sustained achievement of our dual\nmandate objectives of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation.\nIndeed, I projected that inflation would eventually overshoot 2 percent by a\nquarter of a percentage point or so, even with the federal funds rate target range\nheading to 3 to 3-1/4 percent.\nAs I weighed the incoming data at that time, two themes came into focus. First,\nwe had the wind in our sails. The outlook for growth was good, aided in part by\nfiscal stimulus that some were touting as quite strong. And, as I said, I expected\nthe inflation improvements of 2018 to continue. Recall these forecasts were\nmade in the context of a continued, long expansion, dating back to 2009. Labor\nmarkets were vibrant, with the unemployment rate somewhat below our estimate\nof its long-run neutral rate.7 Consumer spending was strong. Firms had invested\nat healthy rates in 2018, and their optimism was high, in part because of changes\nin the tax code and business deregulation. Foreign growth still looked relatively\n\n6\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2018).\nThe long-run neutral rate of unemployment (or the “natural” rate of unemployment) is the\nunemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources without\ngenerating inflationary pressures. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate\nover the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n7\n\n7\n\n\fgood. True, financial market conditions had tightened some in the final few\nmonths of the year as investors became more concerned about the slowdown in\ngrowth abroad, trade tensions, and a prolonged government shutdown in the\nU.S. But the effects on the U.S. economy weren’t seen to be that large.\nForecasts were for a modest deceleration in U.S. activity, with growth in 2019 to\nbe around to 2-1/4 percent—still above the economy’s underlying trend.\nI’ve already mentioned the second theme—that the inflation outlook had\nimproved. This development requires emphasis. After underrunning our target for\nwhat was then a nine-year recovery, core PCE inflation had risen and been close\nto 2 percent since February 2018. With the outlook for solid growth, a continued\nstrong labor market, and low unemployment, there was even some potential for\ninflation to rise persistently above 2 percent. But this modest possibility of\ninflation above 2 percent needed to be balanced against the fact that inflation\nexpectations were still too low relative to target and past experiences in which\nexpected increases in inflation had failed to materialize. The likelihood that the\ninflation gains would be sustained had definitely increased, but I was still quite\nwary of the possibility the improvements would instead prove to be ephemeral.\nTogether, these two plotlines argued for a removal of policy accommodation, but\nat a pace that was unusually gradual and would eventually leave rates only in a\nmodestly restrictive policy stance—about 50 basis points above a neutral setting.\nIn my view, this would have been sufficient to engineer a soft landing for the\neconomic cycle. Again, I note that this would have been a very modest tightening\n\n8\n\n\fby historical standards, as I felt moving too aggressively would have prevented\ninflation expectations from firming symmetrically around 2 percent.\nWith this in mind, at the December 2018 meeting, I thought it made sense to\ntighten a bit further. And the FOMC did increase the range for the federal funds\nrate by 25 basis points to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.\nAs we moved into the new year, some domestic and international data came in a\nbit softer. In addition, there were some sharp moves in equity and bond markets\nand an appreciation of the dollar. Apparently, financial market participants\nthought the risks were larger than most macroeconomic forecasters and the\nFOMC were thinking in December. They also may have been disappointed in\nFed communications about balance sheet plans, often referred to as quantitative\ntightening (QT) by Fed critics. Regardless of the reasons, financial conditions\ntightened some in the U.S.\nWith the emergence of less uniformly strong economic data and rising risks, I\nagreed that it made sense from a risk-management perspective for the\nCommittee to pause from the expected December 2018 (SEP) rate path and take\nmore time to see how the risks would evolve before making our next policy move.\nSubsequently, as we went through 2019, the outlook for foreign growth\nweakened substantially. As I noted earlier, investment spending in the U.S.\nsoftened. And in a repeat of what has become a seemingly perennial source of\nfrustration, inflation fell back below 2 percent. Some of the softness was due to\nwhat we thought were idiosyncratic transitory factors, which have since reversed.\n9\n\n\fBut, more importantly, inflation expectations appeared to slip even further below\nlevels consistent with our goal.\nBy midyear, my assessments had changed. This takes me to my mid-cycle\nadjustment. I concluded that the situation called for us to cut policy rates 50 to 75\nbasis points below the long-run neutral rate and then leave policy on hold for a\ntime. This was a notable change in what I judged to be appropriate policy: Within\nsix months, I went from thinking it appropriate to eventually take policy rates 50\nbasis points above neutral to one where 50 basis points below neutral was in\norder. I think this more accommodative stance is needed to support a roughly\nsimilar growth outlook to what I had anticipated before and, importantly, to\nsupport moving inflation up with greater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2\npercent goal within a reasonable time.\nLimits to what monetary policy can accomplish\nI have adjusted my policy path in a way I see as most likely to yield economic\noutcomes consistent with our dual mandate objectives. As I have since last fall, I\nsee economic fundamentals as being good. But the intermediate-term path for\nmonetary policy simply needed some modest repositioning in order to better align\nagainst possible risks. But, beyond such adjustments, we also need to\nacknowledge that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can accomplish.\nMy outlook recognizes that the economy faces a number of important challenges\ntoday—difficult trade negotiations over important long-term disagreements,\nslowing foreign growth, and uncertainty weighing on domestic demand. These\n10\n\n\fare the types of problems that monetary policy is able to address to some\ndegree, as more accommodative financial conditions can provide an offsetting\nboost to weakening aggregate demand. Furthermore, inflation is below target;\nand as theory tells us so forcefully, in the end, it’s the monetary actions of central\nbanks that determine the inflation rate.\nThat said, there are limits to what monetary policy can do. An important reason is\nconstraints on our capacity to cut policy rates in the event of a serious downturn.\nThese constraints arise because we also face longer-term structural issues that\nmonetary policy has little impact on, but nonetheless have important implications\nfor central banks. Altogether, these longer-term factors point to an environment\nof lower trend growth and lower interest rates that is likely to persist for years. My\ncolleagues and I have spoken frequently and in depth about these issues, so I\nwill be brief in explaining their causes.\nAn economy’s long-run growth rate is constrained by its productive capacity—it’s\na speed limit of sorts; you can exceed it for brief periods, but not forever. That\ncapacity depends on the economy’s available labor resources and on the\nproductivity of that labor. Unfortunately, demographics in the U.S. and in most\nadvanced economies are working to lower the growth in labor input: Populations\nare aging; and in the U.S., the labor force participation rate has been on a\ndowntrend for nearly 20 years.\nAlong with slower labor force growth, the U.S. also has experienced slower\ngrowth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality—that is, gains in\n11\n\n\feducation and worker experience—are no longer adding much to productivity in\nthe U.S. Business investment has been relatively soft during this expansion, so\nthat capital used by the workforce has increased only modestly. Likewise, despite\nwidespread gains in technology, we’ve seen only modest growth in total factor\nproductivity, which reflects how well we put various inputs together to produce\noutput.\nWhen my research staff does the growth accounting arithmetic, they expect labor\nhours to grow by one-half percent and labor productivity to grow by 1-1/4 percent\non an annual basis. This puts the sustainable growth rate of the U.S. currently at\nabout 1-3/4 percent.\nToday’s uncertain and hostile trade climate may weigh further on potential\ngrowth. This is because trade fosters cross-border competition among\nbusinesses, which in turn leads to productivity enhancement and innovation.\nConversely, insulation from international market forces typically reduces a\nbusiness enterprise’s motivation to innovate, as it faces less competition. So\ntrend growth could be even lower than the estimate I just cited. 8\nThese adverse long-term trends have enormous implications for standards of\nliving. But there is little monetary policy can do about them; it can’t affect\ndemographics and at best has a second- or third-order impact on productivity\ntrends. Other kinds of policies can address some of these factors, such as by\n\n8\n\nFurthermore, if there were an increase in restrictions on legal immigration and related actions on\nundocumented immigration, then the growth in trend labor hours would be weaker.\n\n12\n\n\fensuring a well-educated workforce, but these are the responsibility of other\nbranches of government.\nThat said, these trends influence the monetary policymaking environment a great\ndeal. Economic theory tells us that as the potential growth rate of the economy\ndeclines, so does the equilibrium level of real interest rates; this is the rate\nconsistent with full employment of the economy’s productive resources and is\noften referred to as real r*. To get to the federal funds rate that is neither\ncontractionary nor expansionary—the so-called equilibrium federal funds rate—\nyou need to add our 2 percent inflation target to real r*. Today, the median\nestimate of my colleagues on the FOMC for that rate is 2-1/2 percent. That is\nsignificantly below the median participant’s evaluation of over 4 percent just a\nfew years ago.9 It is also below the 5 percent or so rate in the early 2000s, as\nestimated by some models.10\nSimply put, a lower equilibrium rate means a smaller capacity for monetary policy\nto counteract negative shocks to the economy. In the past, policymakers were\nable to provide 500 basis points of accommodation on average during an easing\ncycle. Today, if circumstances demand it, there is far less room to cut the federal\nfunds rate before it reaches the neighborhood of zero—what we refer to as the\neffective lower bound on rates, or ELB. The FOMC would then be forced to turn\nto less effective tools to provide the necessary accommodation, making it more\n\n9\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2012).\nSee, for example, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest, report,\navailable online, https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar.\n10\n\n13\n\n\fdifficult to achieve our mandated policy goals. The calculus is even more\nchallenging if we fail to meet our 2 percent inflation objective, as nominal interest\nrates would settle out at an even lower level. That’s why meeting our inflation\nobjective is especially important.\nOpportunity to make better use of the current framework\nBecause a low r* environment presents practical limits on the capacity of\ntraditional tools, the FOMC is in the process of evaluating alternative monetary\npolicy frameworks that might be helpful in addressing the ELB constraint.\nI don’t want to prejudge the results of our discussions. But regardless of the\noutcome of the review, I think there is an opportunity to make better use of our\ncurrent framework. Here I am thinking specifically about the adjective\n“symmetric” that describes our 2 percent inflation target. The FOMC has stated\nand reaffirmed annually that “the Committee would be concerned if inflation were\nrunning persistently above or below this objective.”11 I think there is room for us\nto better describe what symmetry means for the proactive operation of monetary\npolicy.\nLet me illustrate this point with the current situation in which we have persistently\nunderrun our inflation objective. As I noted, this may have resulted in businesses,\nhouseholds, and financial markets expecting inflation will underrun 2 percent for\nsome time to come. In order to boost these expectations, we need to provide\n\n11\n\nSee Federal Open Market Committee (2019).\n\n14\n\n\faggressive enough accommodation to get inflation moving up with some\nmomentum. After all, no one ever made a free throw without enough muscle\nbehind it to first get the ball to the hoop. This kind of force could well result in\ninflation modestly overrunning 2 percent for some time. But in the current\nsituation, this would not be a policy error. Engineering a modest overshoot of our\ninflation objective better guarantees that we would actually meet our inflation\ntarget in the future. Moreover, tolerating inflation as high as 2-1/2 percent does\nnot entail much of a welfare loss—especially given the lengthy undershoot we’ve\npermitted. This is because for me, more generally, symmetry means paying\nattention to both past and prospective misses from our target to ensure that\ninflation averages 2 percent over the long haul.\nIn terms of a broad monetary policy strategy, I favor a powerful, full-throated\ncommitment to follow outcome-based monetary policies aimed at achieving\nmaximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation within a reasonable\ntime. The best tactics to achieve these outcomes may change over time. For\nexample, at times this approach could prescribe forward guidance with\nthresholds that need to be met before changing rates. At other times, it could\nprescribe overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective with momentum. The\npoint is to focus on our objectives—and not on the specific operational tools used\nto obtain them.\nImportantly, in a world where monetary policy is challenged by low equilibrium\nrates and elevated odds of hitting the ELB, outcome-based policy calls for a\nrelentless focus on our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective throughout the\n15\n\n\fcycle. We have to have a “do-whatever-it-takes” attitude toward policy all the\ntime—in a downturn, when we are constrained by the effective lower bound, as\nwell as in an expansion, if inflation remains stubbornly below our objective.\nI recognize and accept that monetary policy will never be a panacea to all the\nnegative shocks hitting the economy. But when it comes to price stability, the\nmonetary authority has the sole responsibility for achieving an inflation objective.\nFor us, that is symmetric 2 percent inflation.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, as I have for some time, I advocate for an outcome-based\napproach to monetary policy that would achieve our dual mandate goals on a\ntimely basis while effectively managing various risks. Over the past ten months—\nas the forces affecting the U.S. economy changed from tailwinds to headwinds\nand as we lost the inflation momentum we had seemed to build—this outcomebased approach has dictated a shift in my appropriate policy path. Looking\nahead, no matter which framework the FOMC adopts, I will continue to advocate\nfor using all the available and best tools to achieve our dual mandate goals.\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\nBaker, Scott R., Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed. It’s my\npleasure to welcome you to the Chicago Fed’s only branch. Our Detroit Branch was\nestablished in the Motor City 92 years ago. As you can tell, we are not in the original\nbuilding. That is located downtown on Fort Street and still standing. I hear it is now\nhome to a popular restaurant.\nWe are here today to discuss how North American trade affects the auto sector. It is\nfitting that this conference is held here as Detroit occupies a unique role in the history of\nthis industry. For example, we’re about a five-minute drive away from the Ford Piquette\nAvenue Plant. Built in 1904, that plant was the original Model T factory. Detroit also\noccupies a special place in North American trade relations. Along our lengthy border\nwith Canada it represents one of the key border crossings. Connecting Detroit and\nWindsor, Ontario, the Ambassador Bridge alone facilitates about a quarter of all trade\nbetween the U.S. and Canada.1 By the way, in this building we’re close enough to the\nborder that on a clear day you can see Canada from here. All you have to do is look\nsouth.\n\n1\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, “Ambassador Bridge crossing\nsummary,” available online,\nhttps://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/ambass_brdg/ambass_brdge_ovrvw.htm.\n\n2\n\n\fMacroeconomy and trade\nIt’s worth reminding ourselves of the role that trade plays in the overall economy and\nhow economists think about it. Going back to Ricardo and Samuelson,2 macroeconomic\nanalysis teaches us that the value of international trade lies in its ability to expand\neconomic opportunities. We often talk about the benefits of trade. What do we mean by\nthat? International trade allows countries to more fully exploit their comparative\nadvantages. Trade fosters cross-border competition among businesses, which in turn\nleads to productivity enhancement and innovation. Conversely, insulation from\ninternational market forces typically reduces a business enterprise’s motivation to\ninnovate, as it faces less competition.\nAt the Chicago Fed, we estimate that the U.S. economy’s trend growth potential\ncurrently stands at around 1-3/4 percent. Many have hoped this trend could be\n3 percent or higher, but the realities of labor markets and business strategies are\nlimiting the economy’s long-run growth potential. Our low trend growth estimate is\nbased on demographic and productivity arithmetic: Roughly speaking, we expect labor\nhours to grow by one-half percent and labor productivity to grow by 1-1/4 percent on an\nannual basis. But if we were to see a reduced competitive environment with less\nproductive innovation, productivity growth would be even lower. And if there were an\nincrease in restrictions on legal immigration and related actions on undocumented\n\n2\n\nDavid Ricardo (1772–1823) was a British economist, and Paul Samuelson (1915–2009) was an American\neconomist. Both made major contributions in developing tools to illustrate the benefits of trade.\n\n3\n\n\fimmigration, then the growth in trend labor hours would be weaker as well.3 Putting all\nthis together, trend growth in the U.S. could end up being closer to 1-1/2 percent or\neven lower. (And that doesn’t address how this trend growth would be shared by\ndifferent income and skill groups.)\nIn addition, there’s increased uncertainty among the business community as a result of\nthe new trade policy. When businesses are weighing whether or not to make substantial\ninvestments, uncertainty tends to slow down such decisions.4 The auto industry has\nbeen especially challenged by the uncertainty posed by actual and proposed changes in\ntrade policy, as its production operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are\nclosely linked across the three countries.\nWith so much at stake for America, these are crucial issues for all of us to be aware of.\nSpecific impacts on the auto industry\nThe North American auto industry wasn’t always as integrated as it is today. Back in\n1965 the U.S. and Canada reached an industry-specific agreement that eliminated all\ntariffs on vehicles and parts passing between the two countries. This Auto Pact of 1965\nwas followed in 1989 by the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA),\nwhich further liberalized trade between the two nations. Mexico began to liberalize its\ntrade policy during the 1980s. That process culminated with Mexico entering into the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. and Canada. This\n\n3\n\nAccording to a policy brief from the Committee for Economic Development of the Conference Board, “the\npopulation of native-born 18- to 64-year-old workers in the US will expand by just 0.1 percent on average from\n2017 to 2027. Immigrants will therefore be the primary source of labor force growth” (Schaitkin, 2018, p. 4).\n4\nSee, for example, Handley and Limão (2017) and Carballo, Handley, and Limão (2018).\n\n4\n\n\fregion-wide trade pact came into effect in 1994 and removed most of the remaining\ntrade barriers between the three nations.\nTomorrow morning’s keynote speech will address the lessons we have learned from\nNAFTA—the regional trade agreement that has been in place for more than 25 years.\nDuring that time, producers of vehicles and parts have integrated their operations\nacross North America. Last year 16.9 million light vehicles were produced in North\nAmerica. And most of them were sold within the region. The integration of economic\nactivity in the auto sector also extends to the industry’s supply chain. Parts and\nsubassemblies typically cross international borders multiple times before they reach the\nvehicle assembly line. According to recent work by Alonso de Gortari, 38 percent of the\nvalue added in cars produced in Mexico (and sold in the U.S.) originates from the U.S.5\nToday 14 companies produce vehicles in North America—nearly all of them are\nheadquartered overseas. Five of these companies started producing vehicles in the\nU.S. after NAFTA came into effect. Over half of them operate production plants in more\nthan one NAFTA country, taking advantage of the fact that North America is one\nintegrated economic region. It is fair to say that today North America is among the\nworld’s most competitive regions for vehicle production.\n\n5\n\nDe Gortari (2017).\n\n5\n\n\fConcluding thoughts\nImportantly, the context and tenor of trade policy discussions have been changing of\nlate. While much of the attention has been focused on our trading relationship with\nChina, there have also been major developments in trade relationships with other\nnations, including Mexico and Canada. For example, a new free trade agreement was\nnegotiated for North America last year. It currently awaits ratification by the U.S. and\nCanada. Mexico ratified it in June. What are some of the implications of this new\nagreement? According to the United States International Trade Commission, the\nagreement’s tighter rules of origin for auto parts and vehicles are likely to have a\nsignificant impact. But overall, the commission anticipates the agreement will have a\nmoderately positive effect on the U.S. economy.6\nWhile competition and innovation enhance the overall welfare of trading partners, the\nchanges they engender can create both winners and losers. This presents a challenge\nfor economic policy. For example, while we are meeting here, negotiations for new labor\ncontracts between the Detroit Three automakers and the UAW (United Automobile\nWorkers) are under way. I would think that trade and its effects feature prominently in\nthose negotiations.\nDuring the conference we will discuss how public policy can mitigate the adverse effects\nof trade while enhancing its benefits. The role of labor will certainly be a focus in those\ndiscussions. We’ll also get regional perspectives—for instance, we’ll hear from\n\n6\n\nUnited States International Trade Commission (2019).\n\n6\n\n\fCongresswoman Debbie Dingell from the 12th District of Michigan and from our friends\nand partners in Canada.\nFinally, I would like to mention that the Dallas Fed will be hosting a complementary\nconference on North American trade in three weeks. That event will look more closely at\nU.S.–Mexico relations and address trade and immigration issues from a broad\nperspective.\nTo close, let me say that I am delighted so many of you are here today. I look forward to\nthe stimulating discussions we’ll have during this conference.\nThank you.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\nCarballo, Jerónimo, Kyle Handley, and Nuno Limão, 2018, “Trade cold wars and the\nvalue of agreements during crises,” VoxEU.org, March 16, available online,\nhttps://voxeu.org/article/trade-cold-wars-and-value-agreements-during-crises.\nDe Gortari, Alonso, 2017, “Disentangling global value chains,” Harvard University, job\nmarket paper, October 20, available online,\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Disentangling-Global-Value-Chains%E2%88%97-JOB-MARKET-Gortari/8821b60a1d6c6f9a15e3e22f48649c5415bda985.\nHandley, Kyle, and Nuno Limão, 2017, “Policy uncertainty, trade, and welfare: Theory\nand evidence for China and the United Sates,” American Economic Review, Vol. 107,\nNo. 9, September, pp. 2731–2783, available online,\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141419.\nSchaitkin, Brian, 2018, “The power of more foreign-born workers: How raising\nimmigration levels can boost US economic growth,” Committee for Economic\nDevelopment of the Conference Board, policy brief, January, available online,\nhttps://www.conferenceboard.org/publications/publicationdetail.cfm?publicationid=7678.\nUnited States International Trade Commission, 2019, U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade\nAgreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and Specific Industry Sectors, report,\nPublication No. 4889 (Investigation No. TPA 105-003), Washington, DC, April, available\nonline, https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4889.pdf.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nI.\n\nWelcome to Chicago. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed.\nWe’re very happy to be hosting this important Conference on Monetary Policy\nStrategy, Tools, and Communication Practices and glad that you could all join us\nhere today.\nA.\n\nVice Chair Clarida and his team have organized an exciting program for\nus. Our academic colleagues have written a great collection of papers,\nand I am sure the panel discussions will generate a very interesting\ndialogue between academics, community leaders, and policymakers. I am\nreally looking forward to our discussions over the next two days.\n\nB.\n\nI want to acknowledge the outstanding work of everyone who has\ncontributed to putting this conference together; this really has been an\noutstanding team effort. I only have time this morning to mention a few\nfolks. I particularly want to recognize Ellen Meade at the Board of\nGovernors for all of her hard work spearheading the conference. And here\nin Chicago I would like to give a special thanks to Tiffany Butler and Sarah\nDay for their outstanding job in handling what has been a tremendous set\nof logistical challenges, especially to bring the live stream to viewers\neverywhere.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nLike many in the audience, something that attracted me to the economics\nprofession early on was the way economics uses critical analytical thinking to\naddress important public policy questions.\nA.\n\nCentral banks around the world use economic research and analysis to\ninform and discipline our policymaking options. If we are smart and\nhumble, we know we can’t produce all of the right answers; still,\neconomists, public policy analysts, and policymakers recognize the\nimportance of bringing our best thinking to bear in the decision-making\nprocess.\n\nB.\nIII.\n\nThis conference certainly exemplifies these kinds of efforts.\n\nNow, it is one thing to assess the data, pour over many analyses, and make\nsensible decisions. But a central bank’s work is never done without explaining its\nactions to the public that we serve.\nA.\n\nClear and transparent communication of our policy goals and our decisionmaking rationale is important for establishing and maintaining the\ncredibility of monetary policy.\n\nB.\n\nAs we will discuss a good deal over the next couple of days, credible\ncommitment is a crucial ingredient for the success of any monetary policy\nstrategy and, indeed, the linchpin for some of the alternative strategies\nunder consideration today.\n\n3\n\n\fC.\n\nTransparent communications also reinforce the legitimacy of an\nindependent central bank in a democratic society. We have the obligation\nto inform democratically elected officials, their staffs, and the public about\nhow we expect to achieve our policy mandates. This reinforces that the\nFederal Reserve is accountable for how its efforts work out. So it is quite\nfitting that this conference includes panels about what our employment\nmandate looks like in the communities that we serve. And it is appropriate\nthat our discussions go beyond the usual headline macroeconomic\nanalysis to also consider how monetary policy actions are transmitted\nthrough individual households and businesses to the broader economy.\n\nIV.\n\nI have been at the Federal Reserve for 28 years, and I can attest to the fact that\nour FOMC communications have not always been crystal clear. As Chairman\nAlan Greenspan famously joked in 1987, “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must\nhave misunderstood what I said.”1\nA.\n\nBut the jokes aside, during his long tenure as Chairman, Alan Greenspan\nacknowledged the importance of explaining Federal Reserve actions, and\nhe spoke a good deal about them in many public forums.\n\n1\n\nThis quotation appears in Appelbaum (2012).\n\n4\n\n\fB.\n\nSeveral important communications innovations occurred under\nGreenspan’s leadership. And further substantial improvements were made\nunder the leadership of Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and now Chair Jay\nPowell.\n\nV.\n\nA very important landmark was in January 2012, when the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) published a long-run policy strategy statement: This\ndocument formally stated our intention to pursue a balanced approach to\nachieving our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability, where our inflation objective was explicitly defined to be 2 percent\nannual inflation as measured by the price index for total personal consumption\nexpenditures.2\nA.\n\nOne of my most gratifying experiences as Chicago Fed president was\nserving with Charlie Plosser, Sarah Raskin, and Janet Yellen on the\nFOMC communications subcommittee that developed this strategy\nstatement and other innovations—notably adding interest rate projections\nto the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\n\nB.\n\nAnd of course, communications subcommittees after ours worked on\nmany important improvements, such as clarifying that our inflation\nobjective is symmetric around 2 percent.\n\n2\n\nFederal Open Market Committee (2012).\n\n5\n\n\fVI.\n\nAs important as the strategy document and enhanced SEP are, there is more\nwork to do. The experiences of the Fed and other central banks with the\nconstraints on conventional monetary policy posed by the zero lower bound\n(ZLB)—and the reality that we now live in the world where the odds of revisiting\nthe ZLB are all too high—require a fundamental review and reassessment of our\nmonetary policy framework and strategy.\nA.\n\nThis is a challenging and exciting endeavor.\n\nB.\n\nThe papers prepared for this conference, the panel discussions, and our\nFed Listens sessions throughout the United States promise to be critical\nand foundational elements for our FOMC discussions.\n\nVII.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Chair Jay Powell.\nA.\n\nAs you all know, following a distinguished career that spanned the private,\npublic, and nonprofit sectors, Jay joined the Federal Reserve as a\nGovernor in May 2012 and then became Chair in February 2018.\n\nB.\n\nInterestingly, Jay has spent one-half of his Fed career with policy rates at\nthe effective lower bound (ELB). So he is well attuned to challenges the\nELB raises for reaching our policy objectives and the paramount\nimportance of facing this issue head on. Indeed, Jay was the driving force\nbehind this reassessment of our monetary strategy, tools, and\ncommunications.\n\n6\n\n\fC.\n\nOf course, Jay has not waited for the outcome of this review to take\nactions. Notably, he has been a champion of enhancing our\ncommunications, holding press conferences after every FOMC meeting,\nand moving us forward on the Fed Listens project, which includes this\nconference as well as community forums at all 12 of the regional Federal\nReserve Banks.\n\nD.\n\nSo, welcome to Chicago, Jay. We’re very glad to have you here. And the\nfloor is yours.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\nAppelbaum, Binyamin, 2012, “A Fed focused on the value of clarity,” New York Times,\nDecember 13, available online,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/business/economy/a-federal-reserve-that-isfocused-on-the-value-of-clarity.html.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement of\nlonger-run goals and policy strategy,” press release, Washington, DC, January 25,\navailable online,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125c.htm.\n\n8\n\n\f"

            "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nShould Monetary Policy Prevent Bubbles?\nConference Banque de France - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\"Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy\"\nParis, France\nI would like to thank Deputy Governor Jean Pierre Landau, Benoit Mojon, and the Banque de France for organizing this timely\nconference on asset price bubbles and monetary policy. And I would like to thank two of our Chicago Fed staffers—Jonas\nFisher and Gadi Barlevy—who helped Benoit put together such an interesting program. It's been a pleasure for me to be in the\naudience, and now, I will share my thoughts with you on this important topic.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe financial crisis we have experienced during the past two years has challenged the conventional view on how monetary\npolicy should respond to asset price movements. Before the crisis, the common view was that a central bank should not react\nto asset price movements, except to the extent that they affect forecasts for inflation and the output gap. A central bank would\ninstead stand ready to respond if and when a collapse in the prices of some assets threatened its ability to meet its policy\nmandates. Now, in the aftermath of the crisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to\nsigns that an asset bubble may have emerged. This notion is often described as an imperative to \"lean against a bubble,\"\nmeaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high.\nToday, I would like to offer my position on this question. I agree that the severity of the recent crisis argues against simply\nwaiting and mopping up after the fact if and when the prices of some assets do collapse. But the type of proactive response by\na central bank that I envision is not well captured by the expression \"leaning against a bubble.\" I prefer to see policy reacting to\napparent exuberance in asset markets and the problematic risk exposure this could create, rather than initiating action out of a\nstrong conviction that these particular assets are overvalued. In addition, the expression \"leaning against a bubble\" evokes\npolices that are aimed at achieving some targeted decline in asset prices. In contrast, I view the goal of intervention as insuring\nthat exuberance in asset markets does not ultimately threaten the financial system or contribute to financial distress.\nLet me elaborate. This will help explain why the conventional view of how policy ought to respond to bubbles has changed in\nthe wake of the financial crisis. The original case for why central banks should not respond to bubbles relies on two arguments.\nThe first holds that it is virtually impossible to determine whether an asset is trading above its fundamental value, certainly not\nin real time and often not even after the fact.1 The second argument holds that monetary policy as a tool is too blunt to prick\nbubbles effectively. This is because monetary policy cannot be targeted precisely, and will affect other financial and\nmacroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. In addition, the typical changes in interest rates that a\ncentral bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices.2\nDoes the recent crisis justify revising this view? On the one hand, the crisis has certainly taught us a great deal about asset\nprice booms and busts. We've learned, for example, that we must be attuned to the warning signs that might indicate potential\ndangers in housing markets.3 But does this mean we should be more confident in our ability to easily and definitively sort out\nin real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is associated with overvaluation? I am skeptical. Each new episode is likely\nto involve its own idiosyncratic features—enough to bring a new chorus proclaiming that \"this time it is different\" and arguing\nthat we are not in fact facing a bubble. As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff remind us in their recent book, this pattern has\nbeen going on for at least eight centuries.4 As for the bluntness of monetary policy tools, I don't think the crisis has\ndemonstrated that the typical levers of monetary policy are any less blunt than we used to think.\nInstead, it seems it is the severity of the crisis, and the desire to not let one like it reoccur, that has encouraged people to\ncontemplate alternative policy responses. Certainly, the crisis ought to have sobered us to the thought that asset price collapses\nare always sufficiently manageable after the fact. But if the ultimate desire is to reduce the likelihood of such crises, our policy\nresponse should focus on achieving financial stability rather than on identifying and purging asset bubbles per se. An\nappropriate policy response may entail responding to bubbles, but I would argue that this should only be a means to achieving\nthe broader goal of financial stability, rather than an end in and of itself. Indeed, I am concerned that some policies may not\nreceive enough attention if we frame the lessons from the recent crisis too narrowly in terms of leaning against a bubble.\n\n\fSo what steps should we take to reduce the chances of another financial crisis? Part of the answer lies in structural\nprescriptions. The formulation of such frameworks will not be easy, and would greatly benefit from further research on how\nfinancial markets interact with real economic activity. Researchers in both macroeconomics and finance have a good deal of\nwork to do on this score. But I am hopeful that this research can help identify which environments might best reduce the\nchance that financial markets trigger ruinous crises, as well as determine what policy instruments we should add to our toolkit.\nAt this point, I think that regulatory policy provides the most promise. For one, it is important to improve resolution\nprocedures for financial institutions in the event of insolvency. This includes requiring firms to formulate contingency plans\nthat would be used in the event of their failure. Doing so should reduce the chances that the collapse of a particular institution\nwill threaten the broader financial system. Just as importantly, these plans also would improve discussions between supervisors\nand institutions. This would facilitate horizontal reviews and in so doing help first identify and then reduce potential systemic\nrisk exposures.\nAt the same time, maintaining financial stability is also likely to involve more-proactive, state-contingent measures, that is,\npolicies that vary with economic conditions. For example, when faced by several indications that asset markets may be\nexuberant, we might consider increasing capital requirements. This might be either for financial institutions as a whole or for\nspecific institutions that choose to hold assets for which there is concern of a price collapse. These requirements should serve\nas a cushion if purchases of these assets result in losses. They may also end up putting downward pressure on asset prices and,\nat some point, even eliminate speculative excesses. Here I have in mind theories of bubbles that are due to so-called agency\nproblems, where those who trade assets are acting as agents on behalf of others and cannot be perfectly monitored. These\nmodels, such as the models in the papers presented at the conference by Gadi Barlevy and Xavier Ragot, suggest that forcing\nagents to stake more of their own resources could provide a strong disincentive for market participants to purchase overvalued\nassets, possibly deflating a bubble that has already emerged.5\nThat said, it is important to stress that lowering asset prices would not be the direct intent of these policies and, therefore, not\nthe way we should judge their success. We should consider an intervention successful if it helps to safeguard financial\ninstitutions and the real economy in the event that asset prices collapse, not if it manages to lower asset prices to better reflect\nthe true worth of the underlying assets. In fact, we are unlikely to ever know if we accomplished the latter.\nOne advantage of using financial stability as our metric is that it does not require a central bank to take a stand on whether the\nassets in question are overvalued. Rather, the responses would be implemented whenever there are concerns that asset prices\nmay experience a sharp decline in the future, regardless of whether this decline is driven by fundamentals or by the bursting of\nan asset bubble.\nI should note that some policymakers have recently expressed openness to the notion of leaning against bubbles. The proposals\nI just outlined are not out of scope with some of their thinking. This is because they, too, often give regulatory policy a\nprominent role.6 Thus, while I might motivate and describe the appropriate policy response somewhat differently, my\nrecommendation does not represent a radical departure from what others have argued.\nIn closing, let me return to the broader themes of the conference. In the past, economists used to debate whether bubbles were\neven possible. The research discussed here shows that there are conditions under which bubbles can unequivocally occur, even\namong fully rational market participants, and that in some cases it might be desirable to burst them. But what these papers do\nnot show is how central banks can reliably identify bubbles. The best they can offer are useful warning signs, such as those in\nthe paper that Carsten Detken will present tomorrow.7 As long as we can't detect bubbles with great confidence, it seems\nunwise to adopt fighting them as a policy objective, even if only sparingly. Instead, it seems better to commit to what central\nbanks are already mandated to do: preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system at all times, including when there\nis apparent exuberance in asset markets.\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer\nKrane, and Gadi Barlevy.\n1\n\nFor example, in Peter M. Garber, 2000, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias, Cambridge, MA: MIT\nPress, the author revisits three historical episodes that are commonly described as bubbles. Garber concludes that in all three,\nprice movements can be explained by changes in the expectations of fundamentals by market participants. Ellen McGrattan and\nEdward Prescott similarly argue that the rise in the stock market prior to the 1929 crash was not a bubble; see Ellen\nMcGrattan and Edward Prescott, 2003, \"Testing for stock market overvaluation/undervaluation,\" in Asset Price Bubbles: The\nImplications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael\nPomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 271–276.\n2\n\nThe notion of a policy being too blunt because it can affect many variables in addition to asset prices is usually attributed to\nBernanke and Gertler; see Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 1999, \"Monetary policy and asset price volatility,\" Economic\nReview, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 17–51. The notion of a policy being too blunt because it is\nineffective has been raised by Greenspan; see Alan Greenspan, 2002, \"Central bank perspectives on stabilization policy—\n\n\fArticles from the bank's Economic Policy Symposium, ‘Rethinking Stabilization Policy,’\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 5–12. See also Frederic S. Mishkin, 2008, \"How should we respond to asset price\nbubbles?,\" speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute's Annual Financial Risk Roundtable,\nPhiladelphia, May 15.\n3\n\nIn a November 2008 speech, Don Kohn offers an insightful discussion of how his view of asset bubbles was informed by the\ncrisis, including whether we can have advance warning that certain markets are subject to bubbles before the prices of these\nassets decline; see Donald L. Kohn, 2008, \"Monetary policy and asset prices revisited,\" speech at the Cato Institute's 26th\nAnnual Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC, November 19.\n4\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2009, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton, NJ:\nPrinceton University Press. Reinhart and Rogoff go on to argue that since these episodes are so similar, contrarian claims\nshould be refutable with evidence from various advance indicators of such crises. By contrast, Caballero and Kurlat argue that\ncrises are nearly impossible to predict; see Ricardo J. Caballero and Pablo Kurlat, 2009, \"The ‘surprising’ origin and nature of\nfinancial crises: A macroeconomic policy proposal,\" paper at the Economic Policy Symposium, Financial Stability and\nMacroeconomic Policy, Jackson Hole, WY, August 20–22. This debate underscores the point I wish to make: that making the\ncase that we are facing a bubble is likely to be difficult, since it will always be possible to argue about the relevance of\nindicators that predicted crises in the past.\n5\n\nGadi Barlevy, 2009, \"A leverage–based model of speculative bubbles,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13; and Simon Dubecq, Benoit Mojon, and\nXavier Ragot, 2009, \"Risk shifting, fuzzy capital requirements and the build up of financial fragility,\" paper at Banque de France\nand Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13. The original\nwork on bubbles and agency problems was done by Franklin Allen and Gary Gorton, 1993, \"Churning bubbles,\" Review of\nEconomic Studies, Vol. 60, No. 4, pp. 813–836, and Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale, 2000, \"Bubbles and crises,\" Economic\nJournal, Vol. 110, No. 460, pp 236–255; however, they do not emphasize the role of capital requirements in avoiding bubbles\nin these papers.\n6\n\nSee William Dudley 2009, \"Lessons learned from the financial crisis,\" remarks at the Eighth Annual BIS conference, Basel,\nSwitzerland; Gary H.

I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. On behalf of the World Bank\nand everyone here at the Chicago Fed, it's my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\nOver the years, this conference has served as a valuable forum for the discussion of current issues affecting global financial\nmarkets, such as international regulatory structures, the globalization of financial markets, systemic risk, and the problems\ninvolved with the resolution of large, globally active banks. Also, we have been fortunate to have leading academics, regulators,\nand industry executives participate in the various venues—providing valuable perspectives and enriching the discussions on the\nissues.\nThis year's theme is the international financial crisis. If you look back at the past conferences, you will see that the most\ncommon theme over the years deals with various aspects of financial crises. After looking over this year's program, I want to\ncompliment the organizers from both the World Bank and the Chicago Fed for putting together a very impressive group of\nexperts in the current debate on how best to reduce the probability of another financial crisis, and, if one should occur, how to\nrespond. I look forward to the next two days and believe you will find the discussion cutting edge and useful for deciding how\nwe as a global financial community should move forward. Again, on behalf of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago, enjoy the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\nBefore I turn the podium over to Doug, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the theme of this year's conference—financial crisis—\nwith an emphasis on the oversight of financial markets. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those\nof the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWhen thinking about the events of the past couple of years, what comes to mind most often, or the big \"take away\" from all of\nthis, is that we don't ever want to find ourselves in this situation again.\nIf we are committed to that outcome, we should ask ourselves, first, how can policies be changed so that in the future, it will be\nmuch less likely that systemically important financial institutions will find themselves in crisis situations? And, second, if such\ncrises do occur, how can we best contain them, preventing them from having a major impact on the rest of the economy as in\nthe recent crisis? Surely, prevention should form our first and strongest line of defense and remedial, or containment, policies\nshould form the second.\nI recently gave a speech to the European Economic and Financial Center on the issues associated with too-big-to-fail. I argued\nthat in the current regulatory environment it is unrealistic to expect that regulators would allow the uncontrolled failure of a\nlarge, complicated, and interconnected financial institution—certainly not if they had the ability to avoid it and if there were\nsystemic ramifications to the failure. If you accept this premise, and I believe the failure of Lehman Brothers is the\ncounterexample that proves it, then it becomes imperative to construct an environment that prevents our economic and\nfinancial system from again reaching the crisis state we have seen over this past year.\nIn my earlier speech I stressed the need for policy reforms, such as the introduction of an orderly and efficient failure\nresolution process that would create a credible regulatory environment in which firms and their creditors would not expect\nrescues or bailouts. This would reduce the moral hazard issues associated with the too-big-to-fail perception. It also would\nbetter align the incentives of the stakeholders of financial firms with those of society at large. In addition it would allow a\nlarger role for financial markets to oversee and regulate firm behavior. However, even though I think we can significantly\nstrengthen the role of market discipline, regulation will continue to play a very important role in ensuring financial stability.\nThe kinds of events that lead to our recent interventions inevitably occur during periods of financial exuberance. One way or\nanother, asset prices rise beyond conservative fundamental valuations and risk premiums fall well below appropriate\ncompensation levels. We typically use the loose term \"asset price bubble\" to describe such situations. Although I will continue\nthat tradition, we should keep in mind that not all increases in asset prices represent departures from fundamentals, and not all\nasset bubbles need be disruptive.1 Definitions aside, it seems clear that we need to find a way to deal with potential exuberance\nin financial markets if we want to ensure financial stability.\n\n\fSome seven years ago, at an earlier International Banking Conference, which was also cosponsored by the World Bank, we\ndiscussed the implications of asset bubbles.2 The typical view expressed at the conference, which aligned well with much of the\nresearch literature at the time, was that central banks should not use monetary policy tools to \"manage\" or lean against the\ninflated prices associated with asset bubbles. In the event of a sudden collapse in asset prices, central banks were expected to\nrespond with their standard policy tools to address any adverse impact on real economic activity. In other words, monetary\npolicy should be prepared to \"clean up\" ex post rather than try to prevent ex ante a run-up in asset prices.3\nHowever, given the enormous costs of the recent financial crisis, as well as new research suggesting an increase in the\nfrequency and amplitude of asset price cycles,4 many commentators are reassessing the proper role of the central bank in\nmonitoring and trying to deflate rising asset prices.\nIn reevaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy for this purpose, two approaches are typically considered. One is for the\ncentral bank to take an activist role and directly incorporate asset price fluctuations into its monetary policy deliberations—that\nis, explicitly putting asset prices into the policy response function and \"leaning against the wind.\" As an alternative,\npolicymakers could incorporate asset prices into the price indexes used in determining the future direction of monetary policy.\nWhile recent events have indeed imposed significant costs on society, I fear that monetary policy tools may be too blunt for\nsuch a fine-tuning policy.5 Central bankers have imperfect information, and for many asset classes, sudden price declines may\nhave minimal impact on the real economy.6 So, my concern is that using monetary policy to \"lean against bubbles\" could end\nup causing more harm to the economy than good.\nTo elaborate a bit, taking an activist role would likely have policy aim at explicitly hitting some target range for asset prices or\nrisk premiums. So, we would first have to determine those target ranges. I don't know of any economic theory or empirical\nevidence we currently have in hand that would give us adequate guidance here. In addition, there is the \"bluntness\" of monetary\npolicy. Using wide-reaching monetary policy to slow the growth of certain asset prices could have significant adverse effects on\nother sectors of the economy. In normal times, we use our policy instrument, the short-term federal funds rate, to try to\nachieve our dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Adding a third target—asset prices—\nwould likely mean we couldn't do as well on the other two.\nThe desirability of incorporating asset prices into the inflation measures targeted by central banks is also not obvious. Some\nclaim that standard consumer price indexes do not adequately incorporate inflationary expectations; rather, they only account\nfor past price adjustments. Certain asset prices, for example, those of equities or real estate, may better incorporate such\nexpectations. Thus, some argue that to the extent these asset prices are predictors of future price changes, including them in\nthe target price indexes provides a reasonable operating procedure that leans against rising asset prices and adds an automatic\nstabilizer to monetary policy.\nOne potential issue with this argument is whether real estate or equity market prices accurately forecast future inflation rates.\nA bigger question, however, is how to operationalize such an index. What weights should be assigned to asset prices in the\naggregate indexes? Index number theory provides the conceptual linkage between utility maximization and the expenditure\nweights used to construct consumer price indexes. I have not yet seen the theoretical work that says how to include asset prices\nin an aggregate index. I am open-minded to new research making the case for using monetary policy to address asset inflation.\nBut as of now, I am skeptical.7\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that central banks have to deal with asset price swings and their potentially\ndisruptive consequences. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market infrastructure offer more promising paths\nto increased financial stability. This is the \"prevention\" that forms the first line of defense in our efforts to never be in this\nposition again. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to avoid all of the market events that help to create excessive\nexuberance, but it should play a very large role in controlling the existence, size, and consequences of any bubble. For example,\nresearch suggests that a crisis caused by sudden declines in asset prices is less disruptive to markets when financial systems and\nindividual bank balance sheets are in sound condition before the crisis.8 Better supervision and a sound regulatory\ninfrastructure can increase the resiliency of markets and institutions, enabling them to better withstand adverse shocks.\nHow do we promote such increased resiliency? First, we can make more effective use of our existing regulatory structure, tools,\nand authority. And second, a number of reforms of our current infrastructure—both market and regulatory—may help us to\nbetter address the type of problems we saw emerge during the recent crisis.\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient financial markets, either through\nrule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private initiatives.9 They can also encourage more and better disclosure of\ninformation—a key element of effective risk management.\nRegulators and supervisors are also often in positions to foresee emerging problems before they grow into crises. Along these\nlines, supervisors can do more \"horizontal supervision,\" similar to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) that was\ndesigned for the largest 19 U.S. banks. Using procedures similar to those in SCAP, the likely performance of banks can be\n\n\fevaluated on a consistent basis under alternative stress scenarios. In addition to evaluating resiliency to future conditions, this\ntype of \"stress test\" also enables supervisors to identify best practices in risk management and to push banks with weak risk\nmanagement to improve.10\nWhen emerging issues or practices that could lead to disruptions are identified, regulators can more effectively use tools such\nas memorandums of understanding or supervisory directives to dampen the adverse impact of a variety of financial shocks.11\nIndeed, we probably should have been more aggressive in utilizing this supervisory power during the period leading up to the\nrecent crisis. It can be an effective and powerful tool.\nAlthough I believe we can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, we may also need to address the shortcomings of\ncurrent regulations. Already policymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring a variety of reforms.12\nIntroducing a systemic regulator who can identify, monitor, and collate information on industry practices across various\ninstitutions tops most of the reform agendas. While plans for systemic regulation vary in the structures they propose—for\nexample, a single regulator versus a committee of regulators—they all envision macroprudential supervision and regulation as\nthe key mandate of the new regulator. This would be a major component of what I called our first line of defense.\nReform proposals also typically include ways in which we can make capital requirements more dynamic and tailor them to the\ntype of risks an institution poses for the financial system. Varying capital requirements and loan loss provisions over the cycle\nare examples of these proposals. History shows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant\nstate, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions. During downturns, faced with\neroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and binding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and\nexcessively tighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Allowing the required capital ratio to\nvary over the cycle could serve to offset some of this volatility and to partially offset the boom–bust trends we have seen in the\npast.\nVarying loan loss provisions over the cycle is an alternative or complementary way to better cushion firms against sudden\ndeclines in asset prices.\nCapital requirements also could be adjusted by extending risk-based weighting schemes to account for institutions'\ncontributions to systemic risk. This could involve higher risk weights based on factors such as institution size and the extent of\noff-balance-sheet activities. It might also include some assessment of the degree to which the institution was interconnected\nwith others. Such adjustments to capital requirements would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect\ntheir impact on society. The information needed to account for the new risk factors—for example, the degree of\ninterconnectedness—fits well within the framework of information that would be required by a new systemic regulator, and is\nnow being considered in regulatory reform proposals in the U.S.\nSo, in order to fortify our first line of defense, we must make more effective use of the existing regulatory structure and tools,\nintroduce a systemic risk regulator, and reform capital requirements to make them more dynamic and tailored to systemic\nrisks. But adjustments to the current regulations and infrastructure alone are probably not enough. We also need to fortify our\nsecond line of defense—containing the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of systemically important institutions\nwithout resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A necessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a\nsystemically important institution. This is something we currently lack in many cases, though there are proposals now under\ndiscussion that would provide this resolution power.13\nAnother reform proposal that I think can play an important role in the resolution process of systemically important institutions\nis what is typically referred to as a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan. Under this proposal, systemically important institutions would be\nrequired to provide the information necessary to determine how their failures could be handled in a relatively short period of\ntime, as well as to design a plan to efficiently implement such a resolution.14 I see a number of ways these plans can fortify\nboth our first and second lines of defense.\nRequiring systemically important institutions to identify and think through their organizational structure and interactions with\nvarious parties can improve the risk-management practices of their institutions. By developing plans to address systemic\nproblem areas ex ante, the need for an ex post \"too-big-to-fail\" action could be reduced.\nIn addition, should the first line of defense fail, these plans could provide an initial blueprint for the resolution of large\ninterconnected institutions and, in so doing, improve our second line of defense. Currently, individual institutions may not\nhave an incentive to make such plans—after all, they would bear the costs of the planning and see little of the benefits.15 But,\nsociety as a whole would benefit from such contingency planning. Another way to cushion financial firms against sudden asset\nprice declines would be to require them to hold contingent capital.16 Under these proposals, systemically important banks\nwould be required to issue \"contingent capital certificates.\" These would be issued as debt securities that would be converted\ninto equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.17 It would provide firms with an additional equity injection\nat the very time that equity would be difficult to issue, thus enabling firms to better withstand sudden shocks and potential\nspillover effects.\n\n\fThese new policy options, while not easy to implement, would enhance the ability of banks and other financial intermediaries\nto survive shocks—whether from a sudden fall in asset prices or from some other source. I am fully aware that the challenges\nin reforming regulatory structures and practices are not insignificant. But, given the magnitude of the cost incurred in the wake\nof the recent crisis and the possible benefits that would arise from making our economy more resilient to such events, it is\nimperative that we take on these challenges.\nThus, I think we need to strengthen our existing regulatory infrastructure and give strong consideration to making the\nadjustments that could reduce the likelihood of a crisis similar in magnitude to the one we have seen over the past two years.\nWe also need to devise mechanisms to dampen the adverse effects of any disruption that might occur.\nThis year, as in others, this conference invites us to examine and discuss financial crises and asks whether the rules of finance\nhave changed. I've argued that in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the past two years; we need to fortify\nour regulatory lines of defense. We need to have the rules of regulation change. Not necessarily through more regulation, but\nthrough better regulation that is more efficient and effective in its design and implementation. I hope this conference serves as\na platform to inform your thinking and stimulate good debate about the issues I've laid out.\nThank you.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

A quick aside, it should be emphasized that\npolicymakers do currently take asset bubbles into account to the extent that they affect the real sector of the economy. Thus, it\nis not a question of whether policymakers address bubbles. At issue is whether they should or can address asset price increases\nex ante to avoid a resulting sudden decline in prices that more adversely affects the real economy than would have occurred\nwithout the bubble.\n4\n\nFor example, see Randall Kroszner, 2003, \"Asset price bubbles, information, and public policy,\" in HKP, pp. 3–12; and\nClaudio Borio and Philip Lowe, 2003, \"Imbalances or bubbles?

Mishkin makes the argument that not all bubbles have the same impact on the real economy. In\nparticular, he argues that bubbles associated with credit booms are more dangerous because they put the financial system at\nrisk and may result in negative spillover effects for the real economy. Thus, these bubbles may deserve a more activist\napproach.\n7\n\nFor an alternative discussion of potential problems, see Trichet (2003) in footnote 5.\n\n8\n\nSee Frederic Mishkin and Eugene White, 2003, \"U.S. stock market crashes and their aftermath: Implications for monetary\npolicy,\" in HKP, pp. 53–76.\n9\n\nAn example here would be the central bank serving a coordinative role encouraging banks to address operational risks\nassociated with back-office operations in credit default swap contracts.\n\n\f10\n\nFor a further discussion of SCAP, see Daniel K.

I'm Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and it's my pleasure to welcome\nyou to today's conference. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the importance of financial education, a\ntopic that is particularly relevant in light of the subprime crisis and the struggles that many families are facing to stay in their\nhomes.\nThis morning I would like to offer some observations on the importance of financial education, which is of particular concern\nto those of us at the Federal Reserve. I will also discuss the origins of Fed engagement in financial education and some\nsimilarities that I see between the economic and political climate that prompted the Fed to ramp up its financial education\nefforts in the 1970s and where we are today. I will close with some thoughts about the particular strengths that the Fed brings\nto the financial education arena.\n\nThe Importance of Financial Education\n\nRecent research shows that American consumers have relatively low rates of financial literacy. For example, two-thirds of older\nAmericans do not have a clear understanding of financial concepts like compound interest and inflation.1 Financial illiteracy is\nparticularly acute among specific demographic groups, including those with low education, women, African-Americans, and\nHispanics.\nIt is perhaps useful to consider why we think it is important for individuals to be financially literate. To my mind there are (at\nleast) two key reasons. First, if individuals are financially literate, then they will be able to make better financial decisions for\nthemselves and for their families when it comes to budgeting and buying, financing a home, or planning for retirement, for\nexample. Second, when individuals have a better understanding of financial and economic concepts, it is easier for them to\nappreciate the role of the Federal Reserve and the benefits of the Fed's independence when it comes to monetary policy. When\nyou don't understand what inflation is or the risk that it presents to your financial well-being, then it is difficult to appreciate\nthe importance of a Federal Reserve that can take politically unpopular steps to combat inflation.\nSince the 1970s the Federal Reserve has been actively involved in a variety of financial education programs. Of course, it is\ndesirable to know how helpful this instruction is, so we can assess whether programs are cost-effective and perhaps even\nworthy of being replicated broadly. However, evaluating financial education programs is far from a straightforward task—\nsimply looking at the outcomes of program participants can be misleading, because individuals choose whether or not to\nparticipate. For example, enrollees in credit counseling programs might make better mortgage contract choices. But the fact\nthat they choose to enroll reveals their interest in making good decisions about their personal finances. Thus, those particular\nindividuals might have made good choices even without attending a program.\nThe gold standard for dealing with such problems is randomized assignment, which ensures that individuals selected for\nprograms do not differ systematically from the target population. There are important examples of this type of work within the\nFederal Reserve, for example assessments of home ownership education and counseling at the Philadelphia Fed and other\nresearch that will be highlighted in the second panel. But randomized assignment evaluations are usually quite costly. They\nrequire very careful design, the ability to replicate that design, the political fortitude to exclude populations from treatment,\nand extensive follow-up. Moreover, most financial literacy programs—for instance, 2 hour credit counseling—offer small\ntreatments that are likely to produce small effects. Detecting such effects requires studying large populations, raising the cost of\nevaluations even further. So, for some financial literacy programs, such rigorous assessment may simply be impractical. One\nthing I hope we will get from this conference is a better sense of how we should approach the evaluation of such programs.\n\nOrigins of the Fed's Engagement in Financial Education\n\nI date the beginning of the Fed's engagement in economic and financial education to the mid-1970s.\nSo, what did the economic landscape of the mid-1970s look like? The economy had just gone through a severe recession,\nduring which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent. At the same time,\ninflation had been around 3 to 4 percent earlier in the decade, and then soared to more than 10 percent in 1975. The oil\n\n\fexport embargo by Arab states and President Nixon's wage and price controls combined to create long lines at the gas pump\nand restrictions on gas purchases. The oil price shock exacerbated a buildup of inflation and inflation expectations, which was\nfurther worsened by rapidly rising prices of agricultural products and other commodities.\nDuring this period, there were several Congressional attempts to curtail the Federal Reserve's independence. Sound familiar?\nIt was in this environment that the Federal Reserve grew increasingly concerned that the American public was uninformed\nabout the Federal Reserve's statutory responsibilities, especially its monetary policy role. By 1976, a consensus had developed\nwithin the Federal Reserve System that an expanded public information program was needed to reach a broader segment of the\nAmerican public and to dispel misconceptions about the Federal Reserve. This led the Fed to create a more professionally\norganized public information program at the Board and within the 12 Regional Reserve Banks. The recommended programs\nwere designed to move the Fed from a \"passive\" information stance to a more active posture by expanding the dissemination of\ninformation to as wide an audience as possible.\nThe education efforts focused initially on improving public understanding of the Federal Reserve's purposes and functions and\ninforming consumers of their rights and lenders of their responsibilities. Documents from the Fed at that time list several\ndiverse groups who would benefit from the Fed's public information and education efforts, including: bankers, members of\nCongress, representatives of electronic and print media, consumer advocates, educators, students, representatives of organized\nlabor, and the general public.2 Then as now, the audience was broad and diverse.\nAn expansion of public information programs, including economic education programs, began in earnest in the 1980s. During\nthis period, Reserve Banks across the country undertook a burgeoning array of initiatives and activities to facilitate public\nunderstanding of the Federal Reserve and developed greater coordination and information exchange throughout the System.\nEconomic education also became a specialty within public information programs, supporting the development of publications,\ncurricular materials, programs and Reserve Bank staff activities targeting K-12 educators and students.\nOver the past decade, the Fed's education initiatives have broadened to include an additional focus on financial education and\nliteracy. These initiatives concentrate on practical issues, such as: financial skill-building, economics education, bank account\nownership, financial planning, wealth accumulation, consumer protection, and foreclosures—issues that affect many people at\ndifferent stages of their lives.\nAs I'm sure you've noticed, there are some similarities between today and the environment of the mid-1970s. While we are\ntentatively emerging from a severe recession, unemployment remains high; thankfully, inflation and inflation expectations are\nunder control However, there is a similar lack of understanding of the role of the Federal Reserve, threats to its independence\nand various proposals that would change its functions.\nIn some respects, confusion over the Fed's role is quite understandable, given the unconventional steps we have taken over the\npast two years to ensure liquidity flows in the wake of the financial crisis and the non-traditional monetary policy environment\nthat we are in. At the same time, we have an important responsibility to explain our policy actions to a broad and diverse\npublic. Today, as in the past, the better the public understands the work of the Fed, the easier it will be for us to achieve our\nmission.\nWhat You Will to Get Out of this Conference\n\nToday's conference provides a timely and important opportunity to discuss what the regional Reserve Banks and the Board of\nGovernors are doing to ensure that the public understands the role of the Fed. The conference also offers an occasion for a\ndiscussion of what the Federal Reserve System is doing to provide opportunities for consumers to become better prepared to\nmake complicated financial decisions. During the course of the conference, you will have the opportunity to share strategies for\ndesigning successful programs and partnerships in financial education, to learn how regional Feds make the most of scarce\nresources, to hear about research on the effectiveness of various financial education efforts, as well as some of the challenges\ninvolved in measuring the impact of financial education programs generally. In addition, you will have the chance to learn from\npartners and potential partners about strengths and areas for improvement in the Fed's financial education efforts.\n\nOur Comparative Advantages\n\nLet me conclude my remarks by briefly highlighting why I think that the Federal Reserve has a critical and ongoing role to play\nin the field of financial education. First, as I've mentioned, the Fed has two very important reasons for working to increase\nfinancial literacy: wanting consumers to have the information and knowledge necessary to make good financial decisions and\nwanting the public to have a better appreciation of the role of the Fed.\nIn addition, the structure of the Federal Reserve—with the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—\nallows us to work effectively on both the regional and national levels. The regional Feds are ideally positioned to develop\nfinancial education programs that take into account the needs of their regions. For example, they can respond to variations in\nstate education standards and to regional economic conditions. In addition, they are adept at identifying strong partners in\ntheir communities.\n\n\fAt the same time, by working together with one another and with the Board of Governors, the regional Feds and the Federal\nReserve System can impact financial education at a national level. The Federal Reserve System provides an important\nindependent and unbiased source of financial and economic information, as well as a wide variety of opportunities for\nindividuals to build their financial literacy.\nLet me now turn the podium over to my colleague here in Chicago, Doug Tillett, who directs our Public Information and\nEconomic Education efforts and is moderating the opening panel of the conference.\nThank you again for coming to this timely and important conference. I hope you enjoy the conference and your stay in\nChicago.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nThe Great Inflation 2.0 Debate\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, NY\nThanks for inviting me and thanks for that kind introduction. You'll note that I became president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago exactly two years ago. While I can assure you there's no correlation, this period has been among the\nmost interesting and extraordinary in the history of the Federal Reserve System. So much of what the Fed has done in the last\ntwo years has been under scrutiny from the government, the media, the general public and various others. And while the\ndebate has been loud and at times far ranging, our mandate from Congress has remained quite clear: the goal of the Fed and its\nmonetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to promote monetary and financial conditions that\nfacilitate the attainment of maximum employment and price stability. For about the last 30 years, there has typically been no\nconflict in pursuing each of these goals with a single tool—the short-term interest rate. This is because rising inflationary\npressures are often accompanied by unsustainably high growth, and economic slowdowns are typically associated with\ndisinflationary pressures.\nNevertheless, this simple description of the way monetary policy responds to growth and inflation prospects belies the fact that\ndiscussions within the FOMC often touch on a wide range of drivers for inflationary pressures. A small set of relevant factors\nshould include money growth, resource slack, inflationary expectations, energy and commodity price shocks, and assessments\nof the credibility of future policy commitments. And there is a surprising amount of disagreement and uncertainty over the\nexact roles forces play. I'm not talking out of school on this issue: A careful reading of FOMC transcripts over the last 20 years\nwill reveal many different views on inflation. Perhaps this is not surprising. The economics community itself continues to\ndebate strongly the importance of different transmission channels for inflation. Policymakers who are informed by these\ndevelopments—and, in many cases, have contributed to the scholarly research in this area—continue to have a healthy discourse\nover the issues and facts.\nDuring normal times, inflation evolves gradually, and this debate rarely spills over into major disagreements about policy. But,\ntoday, we are not in normal times. The inflation debate on the determinants of inflation has broken out on the front pages of\nnewspapers, with major disagreements among distinguished experts. For example, in recent New York Times op-eds Paul\nKrugman said that large resource gaps have made him worried about deflation, while Allan Meltzer said that massive growth in\nthe monetary base has made him worried about inflation.1\nCertainly, the stakes could not be higher. We have ample evidence of the harm that deflation can cause. The history of the U.S.\neconomy in the 1930s is a case in point, where the price level fell by over 25 percent,2 contributing to the severity of the\nGreat Depression. But, history also shows us the damage that high inflation can wreak on the U.S. economy. From 1965 to\n1980, inflation rose from about 1-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.3 Many economists refer to this period as the \"Great Inflation.\" The\ncostly process of breaking the Great Inflation and then, subsequently, the achievement of price stability took the better part of\nthe next 17 years.4 So it is quite disconcerting when highly regarded analysts talk about the possibility of another debilitating\ndeflation while others—just as highly regarded—suggest that even though we have avoided the Great Depression 2.0, the U.S.\neconomy may be facing the Great Inflation 2.0.\nThis morning, I would like to frame these two extreme views on inflation risks within the language economists and\npolicymakers use to discuss these issues. After highlighting the terms of these disagreements, I will provide some commentary\non the \"lessons learned\" from the historical record on inflation. In brief, I think neither a harmful deflationary episode nor a\nrepetition of the Great Inflation is very likely. Stimulative policies combined with the economy's resilient market forces will,\nover time, reduce resource gaps. Deflation has been averted. And as the economy continues to improve, and when we see rising\ninflation pressures, Fed policy will respond aggressively. Having said this, the main threat to these outcomes would be if clear\ndanger signals were ignored or if central bank independence were compromised.\nAs always, my remarks today reflect my own views and do not reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the views of the Federal Reserve System.\nTwo articles of faith\n\nIt is natural to start by considering the factors that affect inflation. What do economists say? Well, macroeconomists are a\ncontentious bunch. The most accomplished scholars in this field share two overpowering attributes. First, they are highly\nintelligent; and, second, when the subject is monetary policy and inflation, they appear to agree on very little. Nevertheless, I\nthink that there are two strongly held articles of faith that are, in fact, shared by the vast majority of macroeconomists.\n\n\fFirst, large, sustained and explosive growth in money is associated with high and variable rates of inflation. The logic and\nevidence are overwhelming. Economies that are running the printing presses on overdrive, usually to finance unsustainable\nfiscal deficits, generate great instability in prices and high inflation. We saw this in post-WW1 hyperinflations in Germany and\nAustria, and, more recently, in high-inflation episodes in Portugal, Italy, and Argentina. In addition, numerous studies have\ndocumented that when sustained over long periods of time, even moderately high rates of money growth are often associated\nwith significant inflation. However, it's important to note that over shorter time frames, and at lower rates of money growth,\nother factors can intervene to significantly weaken the strong positive relationship between money and prices that we see in the\nhigh inflation examples and in long run studies.5\nThe second article of faith is that high unemployment rates and slack capacity utilization—which we refer to as resource gaps—\nare often associated with falling inflation. A prime example of this is the 1981-82 recession, when unemployment rose to\nnearly 11 percent as the Volcker-led Fed broke the Great Inflation. But, similar to money growth, the evidence regarding the\ninfluence of resource gaps on inflation is strongest when considering extreme economic conditions—when there is either a\nlarge degree of slack or, on the flip side, an excessive strain on productive capacity.\nClearly, these two articles of faith can help frame the current discussion of inflation risks. On the one hand, the explosion of\nthe Federal Reserve balance sheet has led to an enormous increase in bank reserves and the monetary base. Left unchecked,\nthese monetary facts seem to scream \"inflation risks.\" On the other hand, the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is currently only 65 percent, which is the lowest level since this statistic started to be\ncomputed in 1948.6 These resource gaps suggest that disinflationary winds are blowing with gale-force effect.\nIn trying to assess inflation risks from monetary conditions and resource slack, we must remember that these factors are strong\npredictors only in relatively extreme cases. So it is the fact that we currently find ourselves in a situation with competing\nextreme cases—both large resource gaps and big expansions in the monetary base—that leads to today's Great Inflation 2.0\ndebate.\nIn a few minutes I'll return to how I see this conflict turning out. But these two articles of faith provide only a partial\nunderstanding of the factors that determine inflation during more usual times. So it is useful to first describe a relatively\nmainstream view on how inflationary pressures emerge under more typical circumstances.\nFirst-order forces of inflation determination\n\nAlthough inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, many factors come in to play when thinking about its evolution over\nthe medium term. The most important ones are: changes in resource costs, wage and price setting behaviors, and inflation\nexpectations.7 As we'll see, these forces are related to both articles of faith that I just discussed. However, there are\ndisagreements over how much weight to place on each factor, and also how to interpret the fundamentals underlying each of\nthem.\nLet me begin with resource costs. When firms set prices for the products they sell, they pass along current and expected future\nchanges in input costs, including labor costs. As a result, market prices and inflation move in the same direction as these\nresource costs. Resource costs, in turn, move with changes in demand and supply. And everything else equal, expansionary\nmonetary policy will increase demand.\nIt's natural to use movements in measures of aggregate resource utilization, such as unemployment and capacity utilization, to\ncapture changes in the supply-demand balance. In this way, resource costs are linked to resource gaps, which was the focus of\nour second \"article of faith\" about inflation determination. Unfortunately, for a host of theoretical and statistical reasons, these\nmeasures of resource utilization are imperfect proxies for supply and demand pressures, and as such, have an uncertain\nrelationship with price determination. As a result, economists will disagree on the importance of these measures for inflation\ndetermination at a given point in time. I will return to these uncertainties in a few minutes.\nAnother factor affecting inflation is inertia in wage and price setting behavior. Businesses, workers, and households typically\nmake changes to their wages and prices in an orderly fashion. For example, firms tend to stick to their pricing plans, and\nworkers' wages are typically revisited only on an annual basis. This sort of pricing behavior makes inflation inertial. However,\nthese behavioral regularities are not always well understood and we don't really know whether this sort of inertia will continue\nto characterize inflation in all future economic conditions.\nIn addition to direct cost pressures, price setting is influenced by expectations of future underlying inflation. Many things can\ninfluence peoples' expectations about the future path of inflation—it is a veritable kitchen sink. In addition to the resource costs\nI just talked about, other important influences are: changes in money growth, fiscal factors, and central bank credibility and\nindependence. Higher money growth today may lead people to conclude that inflation will increase in the future.\nUnchecked fiscal imbalances can also lead to higher expected inflation if the public believes that at least some of the fiscal\ndeficit will be paid off by printing money. And inflation expectations can increase if everyone believes that a central bank will\nrefrain from increasing policy rates for political reasons, even in the face of inflationary pressures.\n\n\fExpectations are clearly a powerful determinant of inflation, but they are inherently unobservable. Expectations reflect a\nconfluence of both objective market data and subjective beliefs of market participants. Similar to other important economic\nforces—like the output gap—the lack of observability and difficulty in measuring inflation expectations represent a powerful\nchallenge for monetary policymakers. Here is how I approach the issue. Initially, we can attempt to directly assess each\nimportant force for future inflationary pressures. This approach could construct a risk assessment for inflation pressure\nindicators and would include all of the factors cited above, at a minimum, along with an assessment (or weighting) of their\nimportance.8 Although there will be disagreements, I find this constructive approach facilitates rigorous and robust debate.\nAn alternative approach is to be agnostic about the factors that influence how inflation expectations are formed. Instead, we\nwould simply try to infer expectations from surveys and financial market data. Although this is intriguing, there are limitations\nin using this approach to the exclusion of more direct measures of inflationary forces. In particular, if monetary policy is so\nfully credible that everyone believes inflation will not deviate from its goal, inflation expectations will not respond to changes\nin the economic environment. For example, many believe that the European Central Bank's commitment to price stability over\nthe medium term is so strong that measures of euro-zone inflation expectations rarely move. But this sort of stability in\nexpected inflation does not mean that the central bank can relax its vigilance against inflationary forces. On the contrary, this\nstability is a consequence of that very vigilance. We cannot rely solely on direct measures of expected inflation without some\nsort of risk assessment that monitors indicators of inflation pressures. Fortunately, these two approaches for assessing inflation\nexpectations are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are complementary.\nOne of the big questions, however, is to ask what the historical record says about the importance of these different factors. So\nnow would be a good time to turn to a couple of quite salient historical examples.\nThe Great Inflation 1.0: 1965-82\n\nThe Great Inflation in the U.S. from 1965 to 1982 provides a good example of how a long, sustained increase in money\ngrowth tends to increase both contemporaneous inflation and expectations of future inflation. Over this period the price level\nmore than tripled, with the inflation rate peaking at over 11 percent in 1980. This rise in the price level was accompanied by\nstrong growth in both narrow and broad monetary aggregates. The monetary base, like the price level, more than tripled over\nthis period, with a growth rate peaking at nearly 10 percent.9 M2, which is a broader measure of transaction money, more\nthan quadrupled during this period, and its growth rate topped 11 percent.10 It is important to note that this broader measure\nof money, M2, largely consists of the liabilities of the private banking sector, so an expansion of broad money can be triggered\nby an increase in base money only if there's an associated growth in bank credit provision. Increased bank lending was a key\nfactor in broad money growth and the Great Inflation.\nTo see how this works, note that an expansion of base money implies an increase in both a bank's deposit liabilities and—at\nleast for the moment—its excess reserves at the central bank. Banks may choose to put these excess reserves to work by making\nloans, which will further increase the aggregate balance sheet of the commercial banking sector through the standard money\nmultiplier story. This increase in broad money, in turn, can increase inflation.\nDuring normal times, an increase in the monetary base results in an increase in broad money because banks generally lend out\nalmost all of their excess reserves. But if, for some reason they choose not to do so, then broad money will not increase as fast\nas the monetary base, and the likelihood of an increase in inflation is greatly diminished. An example of this occurred during\nthe early part of the Great Depression, when base money grew significantly but the broad money stock actually fell by a\nthird.11 We also find a disconnect today between the monetary base and broad money. Over the past year, the monetary base\nhas nearly doubled as the Fed has rapidly expanded its balance sheet. But, given the sluggish growth in bank credit, broader\nmoney has risen much less—by only around 8 percent. So, we'll need to see much more expansive bank lending if the\nmonetary base expansion is to trigger an inflation response. And we have yet to see this happen in the current economic\ndownturn.\n1979 to 1982 provides a different example of the tenuous link between money and inflation. Between 1980 and 1982 the\ninflation rate declined from its peak at 11.6 percent to 4.8 percent.12 Yet this disinflation was accompanied by an increase in\nbroad money growth, with M2 growth rising from 7.8 to 8.8 percent.13 It is noteworthy that a decline in money growth was\nnot essential for reducing inflation. The explanation is that this was a period of restrictive credit, with real interest rates\nsoaring to over 10 percent. Partly as a result of this tight credit environment, economic activity weakened considerably,\ngenerating substantial resource gaps. Restrictive credit conditions and resource gaps dominated the influence of relatively high\nrates of money growth. This episode constitutes a caveat for the monetary explanation of inflation pressures: you need to\nconsider both demand and supply pressures for money—you can't ignore the prices of liquidity and credit. Indeed, empirical\nresearch has found that outside of extreme cases money growth generally does not have much predictive power for inflation\nover the short and medium runs.14\n\nMeasures of resource slack may be misleading\n\nHistory also cautions us about relying purely on resource slack as the sole guide to inflation pressures. For example, although\nhigh rates of unemployment are typically viewed as disinflationary, the stagflation of the 1970s serves as a counterexample. A\nproblem here is that measures of resource slack can be misleading. One popular measure of resource slack is the output gap,\nwhich is the difference between actual and potential output. Here, potential output is defined as the maximum level of output\n\n\fthat can be produced without generating inflationary resource cost pressures. The problem is that potential output changes\nover time. Furthermore, it is not directly observable and must be estimated. If our estimate for potential output is off, then so\nis our measure of the output gap. This mismeasurement could confound policy. Athanasios Orphanides argues that something\nof the sort happened in the 1970s.15\nAccording to his story, economic weakness was interpreted by the Fed as evidence of a substantial output gap. This apparent\ngap prompted the Fed to expand monetary policy in an effort to attain maximum sustainable growth. But this period of\neconomic weakness coincided with a major structural slowdown in productivity growth and rising structural unemployment.\nSo the sluggish economy represented not so much an output gap as a slowdown in the growth rate of potential output. In\neffect, the resource and output gaps were overestimated, leading to an overly accommodative monetary policy.\nIs this sort of dynamic likely to be a factor in the current situation? Although some of these forces may be present, I am\nskeptical of their quantitative significance. Recent studies done at the Chicago and San Francisco Feds find little evidence that\nsectoral reallocation or other factors are increasing the unemployment rate or reducing measured output gaps on a very large\nscale.16 So I believe that resource gaps remain substantial today. That's a significant mitigating factor against inflation pressures.\nFiscal deficits and weak central banks\n\nBefore concluding, let me turn to the relationship between central bank independence, fiscal policy, and inflation outcomes.\nIndependence of the central bank is always important. Periodically, the central bank at times must take tough actions that are\nneeded for future and medium-term prosperity, even though these actions are painful in the immediate short-term. The classic\nexample is the need to increase policy rates on early signs that inflation could be rising substantially even though the real\neconomy remains weak. In this situation, there may be pressure for the central bank to inappropriately re-weight its dual\nmandate objectives and postpone the monetary tightening until matters in the real economy improve further. A central bank\nthat lacks independence and therefore opts to postpone tightening policy has effectively abandoned its low inflation goal. As a\nresult, both expected and actual inflation can increase.\nFiscal pressures can also pose problems for central bank independence if large deficits are expected into the foreseeable future.\nEven if the central bank pursues a tight monetary policy, both current and expected future inflation can still increase if the\npublic believes that the central bank will be forced to monetize the government debt sometime in the future. Tom Sargent and\nNeal Wallace coined the term \"Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic\" for this process.17 In principle, very large debt levels could\ncompromise the independence of even the strongest central bank if the choice is between monetizing the debt or, inducing a\ncostly monetary contraction.\nHere again, the historical link between fiscal pressures and very high inflation is clear. As I noted earlier, the major hyperinflations in Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland during the inter-war years, and more recent high-inflation episodes in\nArgentina, Portugal and Italy, all involved to varying degrees large structural fiscal imbalances combined with some lack of\ncentral bank independence. The key take-away is that rising, unsustainable fiscal deficits can derail the low inflation plans of a\nweak central bank, and can test the souls of the strongest central bankers. Unpleasant monetarist arithmetic argues that fiscal\ndiscipline is a necessary component for favorable inflation outcomes. There is no reason to think that this conclusion does not\napply to the U.S. While significant fiscal stimulus was an appropriate response to a very large recession, it is essential that the\nnation show that it has a plan for restoring long-run fiscal balance.\n\nPolicy conclusions\n\nI started today by describing two extreme views for the future of inflation. One view, motivated by the expanding Fed balance\nsheet, has inflation greatly increasing in the future, while the other view, motivated by a sluggish economy and large resource\ngaps, has strong disinflationary forces. My view is that large resource gaps have been met by a large growth in reserves: In an\neffort to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, the Fed acted quickly and decisively over the past year to provide liquidity\nto markets and to prevent systemically important institutions from failing. These are things that the 1930s Fed did not do. It is\nprecisely these actions that have greatly expanded our balance sheet. So, the co-existence of the motivating observations for the\ntwo extreme inflation views is not very surprising.\nNow for the hard part: Just as the Fed acted responsibly to prevent a potential deflation, it will do so to prevent a future\nincrease in inflation above our price stability objective. Unfortunately, this sounds too much like, \"just trust us to do the right\nthing.\" This is uncomfortable for everyone, but it is a natural dilemma at this point in the economic cycle when it is yet too\nsoon to actually begin removing policy accommodation.\nI am confident that the Federal Reserve will achieve the price stability component of our mandate. Our response will embody\nthree principles; prepare, monitor, and act. Chairman Bernanke recently testified on the tremendous preparations that the\nFOMC is undertaking in order to be sure our balance sheet can be reduced and that appropriately restrictive monetary policies\ncan be implemented when necessary. And the FOMC is monitoring economic and inflation conditions for the signs that\nadjustments in policy are needed. I hope my comments on inflation expectations and direct assessments of inflationary\npressures have been helpful in this regard. Finally, the Fed will act in a timely and appropriate manner to achieve our dual\nmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\n\fNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer\nKrane, Hesna Genay and David Marshall and Ed Nosal.\n1\n\nSee Krugman (2008, 2009) and Meltzer (2009).\n\n2\n\nAccording to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), the implicit price deflator level fell by about 25 percent between 1929 and\n1933.\n3\n\nThe PCE (personal consumption expenditures) chain price index increased 1.7 percent between December 1964 and\nDecember 1965 and 10.5 percent between December 1979 and December 1980.\n4\n\nYear-over-year PCE inflation did not consistently fall below 2 percent until May 1997. It remained below 2 percent until\nDecember 1999.\n5\n\nSee, McCandless and Weber (1995), Fischer et al (2002), and Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n6\n\nManufacturing capacity utilization was 65.4 percent in July 2009, which is the lowest reading since January 1967 when the\nNAICS-based capacity utilization series start. (NAICS is North American Industry Classification System.) Before 1967, capacity\nutilization is available on an SIC (Standard Industry Classification) basis; at no time between then and its first reading in\nJanuary 1948 does this measure fall below 70 percent.\n7\n\nThese ideas are embodied in macroeconomic analyses from Friedman (1968) and Lucas (1972) to current generations of\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium models like Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).\n8\n\nThese weights could be informed by the performance of formal statistical inflation forecasting models that use these\nindicators.\n9\n\nBetween 1971 and 1980, the monetary base grew, on average, about 8 percent per year.\n\n10\n\nGrowth in seasonally adjusted M0 from Jan 1965-Dec. 1982 = 238.67 percent; growth in SA M1 over the same period =\n195.46 percent; growth in SA M2 over the same period = 346.62 percent.\n11\n\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 299, also Table B-3.\n\n12\n\nThese are December-to-December changes in the PCE chain price index.\n\n13\n\nYear-over-year growth in M2 was 8.0 percent in October 1979 and 8.8 percent in October 1982.\n\n14\n\nSee Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n15\n\nSee Orphanides and van Norden (2002) and Orphanides (2004).\n\n16\n\nSee Valletta and Cleary (2008), Fernald and Matoba (2009), and Rissman (2009).

And thanks to the\nChamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County for inviting me this afternoon to share my thoughts on nontraditional monetary\npolicies and the economic outlook.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or\nsurpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. Much like the rest of Indiana and surrounding states, the South\nBend—Mishawaka area has been hit hard by the national recession.\nWhile the area's outsized education and health services sectors have buffered overall job loss to some extent, this buffer has\nbeen undone by the region's outsized concentration in manufacturing and distribution.\nThese exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for both the economy and policymakers. For us at the Fed, the\nresponse has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ significantly from the standard\npolicies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these exceptional circumstances. As such,\nthey will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is more clearly headed toward\nsustainable growth and price stability. Today I would like to discuss the precepts that underlie these nontraditional policies,\nprovide my outlook for the economy, and conclude with thoughts on some of the tactical issues we must consider when\nunwinding the programs. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\n\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds\ntarget rate, which is the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be reduced\nbelow zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the\nfunctioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align riskadjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across\nthe entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that\narbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not\naffect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional monetary policies. These can be broadly categorized in three\ngroups. The first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely, discount window\nlending through which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral.\nSince August 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including\nreducing the discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new\nlending facilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for\nfinancial participants that are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and Treasury securities. This can be seen as\nan extension of traditional open-market operations. The Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly different scale.\nTaken as a whole, our nontraditional monetary policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\"\n(TSLF, PDCF, etc.). But there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first\nis insurance: Don't put all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the\nthird is size: In an environment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of\nthese precepts before addressing some tactical issues we must consider in unwinding the programs and returning to more\ntraditional policies.\n\nInsurance\n\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks and related uncertainties that emerged in the past\ntwo years and the speed at which they transpired. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial\nsystem, stable growth, and price stability. We saw failures in parts of the financial system, but did not know how serious they\n\n\fwere and how they would affect the rest of the economy. We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, but\nwere uncertain how deep the downturn would be. Finally, price levels declined for the first time in decades, but we did not\nknow if we would slide into an extended period of deflation.\nThe diagnosis of our problems was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that\nwe considered brought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies\nand were unsure how effective they would be and which could be implemented in a timely fashion given the practical and legal\nconstraints we were facing.\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on\nany single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope\nthat we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\nInnovation\n\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss\none program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change.\nLet's look at the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nAfter the failure of Lehman Brothers, the markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) effectively shut down in October 2008. The\nABS markets play a vital role in providing funds that support loans to consumers and small businesses. In response the Fed\nannounced the formation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF is aimed at revitalizing the ABS\nmarkets by providing loans to investors to finance their purchases of certain highly rated asset-backed securities, with the\nsecurities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nThe first markets targeted by the facility were relatively simple assets—auto, student, credit card, and Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) loans. These securities were familiar to market participants, and their pricing was relatively\nstraightforward. Since then we have moved on to more complex and long-lived instruments, including legacy assets.\nTALF has generated two opposite concerns: One is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to fund large\nvolumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck a good\nbalance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent credit\nquality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not\nintended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former\nlevel of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal is to boost private sector credit flows in support of\nthe economy by mitigating some of the stresses in these markets. In turn, this should allow the markets to reach their\nappropriate size in a less disruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on assetbacked securities have come down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some\ninstitutional investors are re-entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have\nlabeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in\nthe federal funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nNotably, in March we announced a considerable increase in our large-scale asset purchase program, in which we buy GSE\nagency debt and MBS and long-term Treasury notes. We made this aggressive move to substantially increase monetary\naccommodation in light of the considerable risks that the real economy faced at that time. As a consequence, however, there\nwas another large increase in the size of our balance sheet, and it is now well above what it has typically been.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper\ndesign required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take\ntime to affect economic activity. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest\nactions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as\ninadequate.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nTurning now to the economic outlook, the U.S. economy has contracted sharply since the middle of last year, with real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) having dropped at an average annual rate of about 4.1 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the\nfirst quarter of this year. Employment has fallen by more than 5-1/2 million since then. The downturn in activity has been\nwidespread across the economy, with significant declines in consumer spending, residential investment, and business\ninvestment.\nHowever, there have been some favorable developments of late, and the possibility that the economy is closer to a turning point\nis stronger now than just three months ago. Although the data have been uneven, our reading of the recent indicators is that\nthe pace of contraction is slowing and that activity is bottoming out. We expect modest increases in output in the second half\nof this year followed by somewhat stronger growth in 2010.\n\n\fSo what are these signs of improvement that underlie this forecast? First, financial market conditions have improved, with\ncredit spreads and other measures of market stress much lower than they were in late 2008 and early 2009.\nConsumer spending, which had dropped sharply since the second half of last year, has been roughly flat so far in 2009.\nHousing markets, after more than three years of decline, have also shown some signs of stabilizing. Sales of both new and\nexisting homes have appeared to flatten out in recent months, though both remain at very low levels. Meanwhile, homebuilders\nhave reduced their backlog of unsold new homes—a precondition for any recovery in homebuilding. But the backlog of unsold\nexisting homes remains high, and delinquency and foreclosure rates continue to be a substantial risk to the housing market\nrecovery.\nLabor markets remain weak, but there has been a (somewhat uneven) decline in the pace of job losses. The May and June\naverage of monthly declines in employment was about half the rate of contraction as the beginning of this year, and newly filed\njobless claims seem to have peaked in late March. However, firms are still reluctant to hire, and the unemployment rate reached\n9-1/2 percent in June and will likely further increase through the remainder of the year before it flattens out in 2010.\nThe industrial side of the economy has been especially hard hit this year, but there are signs that the worst of the decline in the\nsector is in the past. Business fixed investment remains weak, but the decline is getting shallower. Steep inventory liquidations\nmade significant negative contributions to output growth in late 2008 and early 2009. But this means that inventories are in\nbetter alignment with sales, so we expect to see less dramatic liquidation in the months ahead. In turn, the smaller declines\ntranslate into a net positive for GDP growth. Finally, in the coming months, the fiscal stimulus will continue to have positive\ninfluences on the economy.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the\nremarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast\nfor 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two\nconflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of\ncapacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed,\nsome statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent\nwe might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely, consumers' and businesses' expectations of\nfuture inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise\nconsidering that the severity of the downturn might have worked to lower them. And as economic conditions improve,\nconsumers and businesses might expect upward pressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation\nexpectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many economic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, core inflation is near 2 percent, a level I generally find acceptable. In the near term, I think the downward forces on\ninflation will be greater than the upward forces, and we could see some declines in core inflation. But over the medium term I\nsee the risks to the inflation forecast as being more balanced.\nBack to normal\n\nOver time, as the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the challenge for the Fed will be\nthe unwinding of our nontraditional programs. As this happens, the Fed will progressively return to its traditional policies—\nthat is, setting the federal funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short-term loans, so as these programs come to\nan end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to\nbe unattractive in normal times. As they cease to be useful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being\nused less, and we should see that trend continue as conditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to\nmanage it actively so that monetary policy can be more easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out\nas we were on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our\nassets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse\nrepurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on\nreserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could\nrequire sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem\nwith our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the federal funds rate near the target.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance\nsheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast and remains large. There are historical\nprecedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit expansion and to be subsequently\nassociated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: Inflationary pressures will not arise without\nbroader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present.\n\n\fNevertheless, these precedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the\ngrowth in our balance sheet.\nRight now, in the absence of unexpected shocks and changes, I don't foresee the need for any major changes to the policy\nparameters of the programs, and I view us in a wait and see mode.\nConclusion\n\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from\ntraditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety\nof risks we have faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends\nremain unchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable\ngrowth, and price stability. As economic conditions continue to improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction\nin our balance sheet, these ends remain uppermost in our minds.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

The European Economics and Financial Center (EEFC) has a history of engaging practitioners and theorists in the\nhealthy exchange of ideas, promoting closer links between the two groups. Indeed, the type of research and advisory work\nperformed by the EEFC is even more important when policy is addressing interconnected global issues.\nAs we all are too well aware, these are turbulent times in financial markets. We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis\nsince the 1930s. Numerous important financial institutions have either disappeared or survived only with substantial\ngovernment assistance. Even among those escaping such fates, many have seen their balance sheets significantly damaged by\npoor risk management over the last decade. As these institutions have deleveraged and recapitalized, there have been substantial\ndisruptions in credit flows, and economic activity around the world has suffered significantly.\nThis crisis has revealed some major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework. If we truly hope to be able to say \"never\nagain,\" we need to act aggressively to address these weaknesses. All around the world, there is a healthy debate currently under\nway over how best to do this. I believe this debate is valuable. As we adopt new public policies in response to the crisis, we\nneed to be confident in our evaluations of the lessons we've learned and understand how regulatory changes will affect the\nefficiency of the financial services sector going forward. Here in the UK, you have responded to the turmoil with the passage of\nthe Banking Act of 2009. In the U.S., the Obama administration has just unveiled a plan for financial regulatory reform and\nsent it to Congress for review. 1\nAll the major proposals seek to impose greater discipline on the industry. Such discipline, both from the market and from\nregulators, should lead to changes in behavior that reduce the likelihood that firms will find themselves on the brink of failure.\nIn practice this is likely to mean new requirements on capital structure, enhanced liquidity management, and perhaps some\nrestrictions on activities. But, no matter how well crafted such policies are, we also have to recognize the risk that financial\ninstitutions still may fail. Thus, there appears to be broad agreement on the need for reforms in how we deal with the possible\nfailure of systemically important financial institutions—what people often call the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. That is my\ntopic for this evening.\nFor good reason, the development of an orderly process for resolving distressed institutions is a common element of both your\nBanking Act and the Obama administration's new proposal. I'll argue that having such a mechanism is important not just\nbecause some institutions will inevitably fail and thus need resolution, but because without it, market discipline is significantly\ncompromised. For market discipline to be effective, failure has to be a real possibility for all institutions. Meltzer once said:\n\"Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.\" And given the events of the last two years, market participants would be\njustified in at least having some doubts about whether certain firms would be allowed to fail in future crises. Thus, in order to\ncreate effective market discipline, we need a regime shift that removes such doubt.\nAs I'll discuss, TBTF is a very important, but difficult problem. And one for which important details all too often get\noverlooked or ignored. However, it is the details that will determine the success of policy in this area. Additionally, there is\nprobably no single adjustment that would resolve the problems associated with TBTF.\nRather, it will likely take a multifaceted solution. Tonight, I want to give you my take on some issues related to too-big-to-fail,\nas well as stress the importance of some of the details and the reasons for a multifaceted approach to the problem. I should\nnote that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat is the too-big-to-fail problem?\n\nThe TBTF problem is the perception—and perhaps the reality—that the failure of some institutions would have such large\nspillovers to other parts of the financial system, and such significant repercussions for the economy, that regulators would need\nto step in to prevent failure. These interventions could insulate creditors, counterparties, and perhaps even shareholders from\nlosses. Left unchecked, this introduces a classic moral hazard problem: Financial institutions will have incentives to grow too\nlarge, to take on too much risk, and to be too slow to recapitalize when they encounter difficulties.\n\n\fIn the U.S., the TBTF problem first came to prominence with the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois Bank—a bank located\ndirectly across the street from the Chicago Fed. In the resolution process, equity holders were wiped out, but there were\nconcerns about the potential spillovers if debt holders were required to take losses. Thus, Continental was deemed TBTF and\ndebt holders were rescued.2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took temporary ownership of the bank and did\nnot relinquish it until later in the decade.\nAfter the failure of Continental and the heavy losses associated with the thrift industry in the late 1980s, the U.S. Congress was\nvery critical of bank supervisory forbearance. It enacted legislation that dictated \"prompt corrective action,\" or PCA. When a\ntroubled bank's capital falls below successive capital thresholds, it must raise additional capital, restrict activities, restrict\ninterest payments and asset growth, cease payment of dividends, and limit senior executive compensation.3 With the same\nlegislation, an explicit policy on TBTF was codified in the systemic risk exception to the 1990 Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The goal was to explicitly minimize the use of TBTF by making the process very\npublic and requiring sign-off by leading regulators and senior officials, including the U.S. President.\nWhile PCA worked fairly well in the recent financial crisis, some large commercial banks failed and were liquidated. Others\nwere purchased, some with support from regulatory authorities and some without support. There were, however, some\nperceived inconsistencies and concerns about ad hoc procedures in certain situations. Two notable cases were the sale of\nWachovia Corporation—which, by the way, was the first time the systemic risk exception to FDICIA was ever deployed—and\nwhen the FDIC took over management of the day-to-day operations of IndyMac Federal Bank after it was unable to find a\nbuyer.\nThe recent financial crisis also revealed new dimensions of the TBTF problem. The systemic risk exception applies only to\ncommercial banks. But recently there have been significant issues regarding the systemic implications from the failure of large\nnonbank financial firms. Significant problems in the U.S. have occurred surrounding investment banks, and similar concerns\nare being expressed about insurance companies and hedge funds. There are also issues regarding the relationships between\nbanks and their parent holding companies. For example, significant losses have been imposed on stakeholders of bank holding\ncompanies—although the stakeholders were not always clear on whether they owned claims on the bank or on the holding\ncompany. More generally, the complicated interconnections between the bank and its holding company have made the\nresolution of the bank more difficult and costly.4\nThese nonbank financial institutions are organizations for which no formal systemic risk exception exists; their resolution is\nhandled through standard bankruptcy proceedings.5 Such proceedings do not bring any extra resources to bear to deal with\npotential spillover effects to other market participants and the real economy. Although the societal costs from such spillovers\nare difficult to quantify, at times they could be substantial. Concerns about the disruptive aspects of putting a systemically\nimportant nonbank through the bankruptcy process has made regulators and others rethink the regulatory infrastructure\ncovering these institutions in a number of ways.\nCan regulators \"just say no\"?\n\nLet's discuss some of the means people have suggested to address TBTF problems. One view is rather simple: Let the market\nwork. This view holds that TBTF problems arise only because regulators lack sufficient backbone to let large firms fail. If the\nauthorities would just commit to not undertaking bailouts and let existing financial and bankruptcy laws operate, the resolution\nprocess would proceed with losses being allocated according to predetermined priorities. There may be temporary market\ndisruptions, but the claim is that the disruptions will be manageable.\nAdvocates of such a hands-off policy argue that the main problems resulting from TBTF are moral hazard and the long-run\ndistortions and inefficiencies associated with it. In this view, problems arise when authorities deviate from a policy of\nnonintervention, sending mixed signals and confusing markets. This weakens the incentives of firms and their creditors to\nexercise prudent judgment. If there were no expectation of a government intervention, financial institutions would be\ncompelled to choose a capital structure to withstand market forces, prudently manage risk, and, as a result, lower the\nprobability of a large bank failure.\nThe logic of market discipline is certainly compelling. Given adequate transparency, the market has substantial potential to\nmonitor firm behavior, perhaps more closely than a small number of regulators. And in my view, enhanced market discipline is\nalmost certainly an important part of the solution to our regulatory problems. But the shift to a policy of increased reliance on\nmarket discipline is not a simple process. Regulators cannot simply decide to \"just say no\" going forward. Their commitment to\navoid intervention must be credible, and must be perceived to be credible by the markets. Credibility can take years to develop\nand can be destroyed quickly by just one instance of forbearance or the provision of exceptional assistance.\nPlus there is another issue: It is not obvious that the optimal choice in dealing with the potential failure of a systematically\nimportant financial institution is always to \"just say no.\" Let's think about the underlying the decision to let such an institution\nfail or to provide it with exceptional support.\nThe costs of providing exceptional support are increased future risk-taking by other large or highly interconnected (TBTF)\ninstitutions without inducing corresponding increases in risk management. Such increased risk-taking would lead to distortions\nin both the levels and allocation of credit, possibly inducing excessive investment in higher-risk projects or sectors of the\n\n\feconomy. This would adversely affect real macroeconomic performance.\nAlternatively, the costs of letting a large institution fail in a disorderly way are the macroeconomic consequences of resulting\ndisruptions in financial markets. Creditworthy households and businesses may not be able to fund their ongoing activities.\nFurthermore, investment in plant and equipment would be distorted, which could also have long-run implications resulting\nfrom a suboptimal capital stock.\nThe cold calculus of this decision would involve comparing the two costs. This is very difficult to do and intelligent individuals\ncan reasonably disagree on the two magnitudes. Proponents of the \"just say no\" policy will argue that in the moment of crisis,\nregulators overestimate the cost from current market distortions and discount the future benefits from imposing market\ndiscipline. That is human nature. As a result, regulators may occasionally err on the side of providing exceptional assistance.6\nPerhaps. However, it is not at all clear that this has been the case in recent situations.\nConsider one of the more prominent episodes during the course of the current crisis. In March of last year, the Federal\nReserve provided extraordinary assistance to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. Proponents of the \"just say\nno\" position argue that this was a mistake.7 Bear should have been allowed to fail, they argue, with debt holders and\ncounterparties taking appropriate losses. This, in their view, would have sent a clear message that government assistance would\nnot be forthcoming in the future. They claim the consequences for the economy would have been relatively modest and worth\nthe long-term benefits. I disagree.\nLet's think about the counterfactual question of what would have happened if we had simply let Bear fail at the outset of the\ncrisis. While it is impossible to know for sure how events would have turned out, I think that it is quite likely that we would\nhave seen markets seize up sooner than they actually did. My thinking is influenced by the events following the failure of\nLehman Brothers, when investors became extraordinarily risk averse and withdrew liquidity funding. I think a Bear Stearns\nfailure would have almost surely led to similar risk aversion. For instance, Bear also was prominent in the tri-party repo\nmarket, which serves as an important source of short-term funding for large financial institutions. Upon failure, Bear's\ncounterparties would have received collateral, which they either could not or would not want to hold. This could have lead to a\ndumping of certain asset classes on the market at fire-sale prices and, most likely a general aversion to counterparty risk.\nSimilarly, just like the Reserve Fund held too much of Lehman Brothers' commercial paper when it failed, other mutual funds\nwere likely overexposed to the paper of Bear Stearns. Thus, a Bear failure might also have generated at the time a run on\nmoney market mutual funds and commercial paper markets.\nFurthermore, the problems in financial markets were already largely in place by the spring of 2008. Losses related to mortgage\nportfolios were going to be incurred by someone. The credit default swap (CDS) exposure of AIG (American International\nGroup Inc.) had been put in place years before and losses from that exposure were not a result of poor risk management\nfollowing the demise of Bear Stearns, on March 17. In retrospect, given the massive mortgage-related losses, the downgrade of\nAIG was likely inevitable based on its investment strategy. The calls for additional CDS collateral were going to be triggered\nregardless of the decisions on Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, resulting in the type of liquidity crisis that necessitated loans\nfrom the central bank.\nIn my view, the conclusion to be drawn from this hypothetical is that not providing exceptional assistance to Bear would have\nresulted in financial distress and a stock market implosion in March of last year rather than in September. While one cannot\nsay for sure whether the situation would have been worse, I personally doubt it would have been better. Without assistance, the\npotential for even more widespread disruption seems more plausible to me. A fundamental observation is that large mortgage\nlosses had to be allocated among leveraged investors. This set in motion a scramble to avoid taking losses.\nNevertheless, the argument can be made that by letting Bear Stearns enter bankruptcy during a period of financial distress,\nfinancial institutions would have realized that they would be subject to market discipline in the future, which would induce\nmore prudent behavior. However, I think it is more likely that we would have seen exactly the opposite reaction. Given the\nlikely severe fallout, regulators would have been sharply criticized. This could have generated a perception that regulators\nwould never again allow such a calamity to occur. Thus the commitment to \"just say no\" would no longer be credible. The\nmarket would perceive the potential for using TBTF to actually be greater than before, not less. Indeed, this is the lesson that\nsome draw from the failure of Lehman Brothers and the resulting financial upheaval.\nThese concerns about the role of market discipline and its limitations are strongest during times of crisis. The decisions\nregarding the failure of a single large bank during a more tranquil time could be very different. But the cost–benefit calculus\ncould also be made significantly different, even during times of crisis, if a better infrastructure was in place to resolve problem\ninstitutions in a less disruptive manner. We would all prefer such a tilting away from forbearance and public assistance.\nHowever, to assume you could \"just say no\" in the environment of March 2008 with the existing infrastructure is somewhat\nidealistic in my view and overlooks a number of details involved with the resolution process.\nTo position ourselves to better utilize market discipline, we need a better resolution process that will address the new\ndimensions of the TBTF problem. I believe an effective resolution process requires two elements:\n\n\f1. An entity must be responsible for overseeing systemically important financial institutions (micro-prudential regulation). In\norder to reduce the chances that the systemically important institutions get into financial difficulties, that entity would need the\npower to gather necessary data and to restrict the behavior of these institutions. The entity would also need to evaluate the\ninterconnectedness of institutions and to address potential problems for markets as a result of spillover effects (macroprudential regulation).\n2. There should be a well-defined resolution process that limits market disruption and avoids the problems associated with a\nfinancial institution going through the standard bankruptcy process. Regulators have been criticized too often for addressing\neach failure in an ad hoc manner, as if there were no lessons from history. The need for an advance plan is imperative.8\nThe Obama administration's reform plan provides useful proposals for these concerns. Yet even under the best plan that meets\nthese elements, getting the details right is crucial. Who will decide when the resolution process begins? What should the trigger\nbe? Should prompt corrective action begin at higher levels of capitalization than the current triggers for banks? Is temporary\nnationalization a necessary component? Will allowing for this potential lead to excessive use of this option? How will a\nmultinational presence complicate the policy alternatives and how can that best be addressed? Details matter, and by getting the\ndetails correct, we can hopefully minimize the TBTF problem going forward.\nLimiting size and complexity\n\nSome recommendations to address TBTF involve limiting the ability or incentive of financial institutions to become\nparticularly large or complex, thus lessening the odds of adverse spillovers. In other words, to keep institutions from becoming\ntoo big to fail, keep them from becoming too big, period.9 In the U.S., one could possibly achieve this by strictly enforcing\nnational deposit share limits and perhaps tightening those limits over time. One could even consider the breaking up of firms\nin a manner similar to how Standard Oil was broken up in the U.S. in the early twentieth century. But size is not the only\nfactor that would need to be considered. There would also have to be limits on \"interconnectedness\" and on product\ncomplexity. Additionally, there are probably other time-varying dimensions that may prove to be significant. The dynamic and\nevolutionary features of systemic importance will require continual monitoring.\nI'd like to make two points about these policy alternatives. First, one would assume that financial institutions increase their size,\ndevelop new financial products, and become interconnected with other firms because doing so creates real economic value. It\nmay be that this went somewhat beyond socially optimal levels in recent years. But at a basic level, growth, new products, and\nactivities that increase interconnectedness can improve welfare. Thus, one needs to be careful to not overly constrain such\nactivities.10\nA second issue involves the market response to regulatory constraints. If we constrain certain behavior, firms will likely develop\nalternative means to accomplish the same ends.11One can argue that many of the off-balance-sheet items and special-purpose\nvehicles that were created in recent years were at least in part attempts to get around regulatory constraints. This so-called\nregulatory arbitrage also likely increased the role of the shadow financial sector.12Thus, while constraints sound\nstraightforward and simple to implement, they may require significant resources to effectively enforce and may be less effective\nthan expected as firms attempt to get around them.\nWhile severe limits on the size and scope of financial institutions may be neither feasible nor desirable, if such activities result\nin risk to the financial system it may be appropriate to impose special requirements on them. Thus, an alternative proposal to\naddress TBTF is to expand the risk-based capital requirements to explicitly account for contributions to systemic risks. This\ncould involve larger weights on factors associated with systemic risk, such as institution size, off-balance-sheet activities, and\nthe degree of interconnectedness with other institutions. Adjusting capital requirements for these and other systemic factors\nwould make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society rather than just themselves. This\nidea of forcing financial institutions to account for the impact of their actions on others is also addressed in the Obama\nadministration's proposal. This approach could fit within our existing Basel capital requirements, as regulators could expand the\nrisk factors to account for systemic risk. Of course, we would still encounter regulatory avoidance. And it also could be\nparticularly difficult to decide on the variables and weights to include in the risk-based capital calculations.\nThis incorporation of systemic risk factors would require supervisors to obtain improved measures of interconnectedness and\nsystemic importance. Along these lines, the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation13has recommended the\ndevelopment of a new comprehensive database to be managed by supervisors. All larger institutions would be required to\nprovide systemic-risk-related data at regular time intervals—say, on a quarterly basis—into the central system, as would\nfinancial institutions of any size deemed to have operations that would lead to significant spillover effects. One could easily\nenvision this including a broad array of financial institutions (banks, thrifts, insurance companies, hedge funds, governmentsponsored enterprises, etc.) and possibly entities outside of the financial sector.\nThe goal is to allow regulators and, potentially, the market to better understand the fault lines in financial markets and to more\nclearly understand the impact of systemic risk. The Squam Lake Working Group stresses the need to share the information\namong regulatory agencies and to provide it to the private markets, perhaps with a lag, to enable the marketplace to detect\ntrends and tendencies that may otherwise be overlooked.14\n\n\fIn addition to modifying the risk weights, there have also been proposals to introduce countercyclical capital requirements. It is\ntypically during boom times that excessive risk taking occurs, as firms get caught up in the good times and seem to assume\nthey will continue forever. Countercyclical capital requirements would tend to lean against the wind to combat this. For\nexample, just to fix ideas for the discussion, to be considered adequately capitalized, tier 1 plus tier 2 capital requirements\ncould be changed from 8 percent across the entire business cycle to perhaps 10 percent during \"good times\" and 7 percent\nduring \"problem times.\" Time-varying requirements would serve as a governor to excessive growth and would allow for the\ngeneration of an additional capital cushion that could be utilized when the economy slows. Although this would induce credit\nrestraint if imposed in the middle of a cycle, sufficient planning and credibility would ultimately lead institutions to adopt more\nrisk-prudent capital structures.\nWhile I believe there is a place for such revisions to capital requirements, again, the details are crucial. Attempting to force\nfirms to hold capital to reflect the systemic risks they pose is easy to defend in principle, but very difficult to adequately\nimplement. Liquidity problems were a major concern during the recent crisis. How would liquidity be incorporated into\nchanges in capital requirements? Recall that the Basel capital requirements generated concerns about banks gaming\nimperfections in the relative capital requirements across asset risk categories. Imposing capital requirements on systemic-riskrelated factors and weights that vary across the business cycle would be significantly more difficult and would induce a\nresponse by the affected firms. Thus, regulators would need to anticipate and react to that response in setting policy. As such,\nproperly setting capital requirements will likely be an ongoing, iterative process.\nContingent capital and self-created bankruptcy plans\n\nThe idea of supplementing bank capital during \"good\" times has been taken further by Mark Flannery and members of the\nSquam Lake Working Group. Fundamentally, the argument is that banks need to hold more capital and they tend to resist\nholding higher levels because it is expensive. Similarly, existing shareholders are not in favor of issuing new capital because of\nthe associated dilutive effects. To address this problem, the Squam Lake Working Group proposes that systemically important\nbanks should be required to issue new \"contingent capital certificates.\" These securities would be sold as debt liabilities that\nmake standard tax-deductible interest payments. However, unlike conventional debt obligations, they would be converted into\nequity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.15 The triggering mechanism could be based on a number of\nthings including existing capital levels, equity share prices, declaration by the regulators that conditions of systemic stress exist,\nor a violation of covenants in the debt contract. Conversion would not be optional; rather it would be mandatory once\ntriggered by one of these mechanisms. If all goes well, the bonds are retired with typical cash payments to the debt holders.\nHowever, if the bank's position deteriorates, the debt converts into new equity shares, diluting the existing shares and serving\nto cushion losses. To avoid reaching this point of conversion the bank would likely be more willing to promptly issue new\nequity when difficulties are encountered. Thus, the new debt instruments could improve risk-taking incentives and provide an\nadditional capital cushion to insulate taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund from costly interventions. Another problem\nmight occur if the supply of funds to these convertible investments is small, and hence, the debt would be expensive. Well, if\nmore capital was in place, the convertible debt would be less likely to convert; hence, it would be less risky and presumably\ncheaper. For safety and soundness reasons, a better capital structure is a key objective, and these forces help to improve the\ncapital structure.\nA related alternative involves enhancing capital cushions by requiring systemically important firms to purchase contingent\ncapital in the form of capital insurance.16 The general purpose is the same as that for using contingent capital certificates—that\nis, to provide a source of additional capital during crisis periods. With this proposal it is imperative that the insurance be failproof; thus, proposals typically require that the insurance funds be placed in a segregated lock box—perhaps in Treasuries.17\nTargeted issuers of the insurance could include sovereign wealth funds or private equity. The trigger for the insurance payment\ncould be based on the condition of the individual firm or on the condition of the financial industry. Again, the purpose of the\ninsurance is to address catastrophes; thus it would be more commonly associated with deteriorating industry conditions.\nA final reform proposal requires that systemically important financial institutions help plan their own resolution process. The\nidea is to have a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan that has already considered and addressed problem resolution areas. This may sound\nsomewhat odd, but the firm itself must be in a preferred position to be aware of potential impediments to resolution.18\nSupervisors would require firms to address potential resolution problem areas, such as the transfer of the derivatives book or\nresolution of foreign subsidiaries. One can envision this plan being stress tested as part of the regular examination process.\nSuch a discussion would yield risk-management benefits for the firms and the supervisor. Requiring such a plan could also\nsomewhat constrain firms from taking on higher-risk activities during boom times and would force them to think about\ncontingent plans and develop them even when financial difficulties seem far removed. Again, the plan sets up ex ante\nprocedures to help avoid conditions that require consideration of TBTF.\nAs interesting as these new proposals are, they also have potential implementation problems. Again, details count. For\ncontingent capital there is the matter of deciding on the appropriate conversion trigger. For the \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan, there\nare potential issues of regulatory avoidance and attempting to hide relevant information. There is also the issue of deciding\nwhether the information should be made public. All these issues need to be carefully evaluated. The quality of the decisions on\nthese details will determine the effectiveness of the new program.\n\n\fClosing comments\n\nSo where do I come out on these issues? I do believe that we can do a much better job of preventing (albeit, not entirely\navoiding) crisis situations and I believe we can be better prepared to address them when they do occur. Much of the current\npolicy discussion on the need for some form of a systemic risk regulator and improved resolution process is most appropriate\nand should be thoroughly vetted. Both ideas are included in President Obama's regulatory reform proposal that was recently\nsent to Congress. Obviously, there are a number of details to be addressed, but I hope we can grasp the moment and not let the\nopportunity to implement meaningful reform pass.\nI believe that such policies aimed at influencing the ex ante behavior of the firm are likely to be effective at avoiding crisis\nsituations in the first place. The reinforcement or backup capital created through the contingent capital or catastrophe\ninsurance requirements would better enable firms to ride out the turbulent times. The countercyclical capital requirements\nand/or the self-created \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan could serve as a governor on risk-taking during boom times, again, serving to\ndecrease the potential for encountering financial crises. It could also lead to a more efficient and effective failure resolution\nprocess. I believe these proposals merit careful consideration.\nFor a number of reasons, I think it is important to create \"regime-shifting\" reforms. Here, the reform proposals could also be\nuseful in that they announce to the industry that a new regulatory environment exists. Procedures would be in place to dampen\nthe potential need for TBTF policies. There would be fewer costs involved from letting relatively complex firms be resolved\nwithout social assistance. Thus, there would be fewer incentives to protect the troubled financial firm. Realizing this, it would\nbe in the financial firm's best interest to more prudently manage risk. Less emphasis would be placed on regulatory experiences\nfrom the past. Moral hazard would be reduced.\nFinally, while I find a number of these proposals to be interesting, I don't see how any in isolation would fully address all the\nassociated problems. It seems that there is a need for a systemic regulator and a fully developed failure resolution plan for\nsystemically important firms. While these changes are necessary, additional tools are required to alter firm behavior to lower\nthe potential for encountering problems and to make the resolution go smoothly once it becomes necessary. I believe a number\nof the proposals discussed could serve that purpose, and they would be complementary instead of substitutes. They warrant\nserious consideration if we are to adequately address the issues associated with TBTF.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee The Banking Act of 2009, available online; and U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, Financial Regulatory Reform, A\nNew Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation, Washington, DC, June 17, available online.\n2\n\nWhile Continental Illinois is often associated with the first use of the TBTF policy in the U.S., many of the characteristics of\nthe resolution were not unique and had been utilized before.

And thanks to Kaarina of the Executives' Club of Chicago for\ninviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on non–traditional monetary policies.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or\nsurpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. These exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for\npolicymakers. For us at the Fed, the response has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ\nsignificantly from the standard policies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these\nexceptional circumstances. As such, they will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is\nmore clearly headed toward sustainable growth and price stability. This morning I would like to discuss the precepts that\nunderlie these nontraditional policies and some tactical issues we must address in unwinding them. I should note that these are\nmy own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\n\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds\ntarget rate, which had been the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be\nreduced below zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the\nfunctioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align riskadjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the Federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across\nthe entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that\narbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not\naffect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional policies. These can be broadly categorized in three groups.\nThe first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely discount window lending\nthrough which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral. Since\nAugust 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including reducing\nthe discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new lending\nfacilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for financial\nactors who are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of GSE notes. This can\nbe seen as an extension of traditional open-market operations: the Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly\ndifferent scale.\nWithin these groups, there are a number of particular programs or facilities, each with its own terms and conditions. Taken as\na whole, our nontraditional policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\" (TSLF, PDCF, etc.).\nBut there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first is insurance: Don't\nput all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the third is size: In an\nenvironment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of these precepts in\nturn, before concluding with some thoughts about the return to traditional policies.\n\nInsurance\n\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks that emerged in the past two years and the speed at\nwhich they emerged. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial system, stable growth, and price\nstability; and diagnosing each risk raised difficult questions. We saw failures in parts of the financial system. How serious were\nthey, and how would they affect the rest of the economy? We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, with\nmonth–to–month job losses and sales declines as steep as any in recent memory. Finally, prices declined for the first time in\ndecades. Were we about to slide into an extended period of deflation?\nThe diagnosis was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that we considered\nbrought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies. Which\ntreatment was appropriate and could be implemented in a timely fashion, particularly given the practical and legal constraints\n\n\fwe were facing? Under what circumstances and for how long should it be applied? How should the treatment be scaled back as\nconditions improve?\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on\nany single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope\nthat we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\nInnovation\n\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss\none program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change.\nLet us look at the Term Asset–Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nThe market for asset–backed securities has long played a vital role in funding loans to consumers and small businesses. This\nmarket effectively shut down in October 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. In response the Fed announced the\nformation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF provides loans to investors to finance their\npurchases of certain highly–rated asset–backed securities, with the securities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nAs conditions evolved we modified the facility along multiple dimensions, even before it began its operations at the beginning\nof April. The first markets targeted by the facility were those for securities backed by relatively simple assets. These securities\nwere familiar to market participants and their pricing was relatively straightforward. Then we moved on to more complex and\nlong–lived instruments.\nInitially the only eligible securities were those backed by newly and recently originated auto, credit card, and student loans, and\nsmall business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. In April, other securities were made eligible, namely,\nloans backed by mortgage servicing advances, leases of business equipment or vehicle fleets, and dealer inventories. This month,\neligibility was broadened to commercial mortgage–backed securities.\nWe changed the acceptable origination date as well. Initially, securities were eligible for TALF only if they were backed by new\nor recently issued loans. The intent was to bring the asset–backed market back to life by directly financing investors willing to\npurchase the securities, and therefore indirectly funding the loans that backed them. In March 2009, the Fed signaled that\nTALF could be extended to legacy assets, with the intention of stimulating the extension of new credit generally by easing\nbalance sheet pressures on potential lenders.\nFinally, the maximum maturity of TALF loans has been extended from three years to five, and in February the maximum size\nof the operation was increased from $200 billion to $1 trillion to match the growing list of eligible securities.\nAdmittedly TALF has generated two opposite concerns: one is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to\nfund large volumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck\na good balance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent\ncredit quality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not\nintended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former\nlevel of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal rather is to jump–start these markets back to life by\nmitigating some of the stresses they are experiencing. In turn, this should allow them to reach their appropriate size in a less\ndisruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on asset–backed securities have\ncome down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some institutional investors are\nre–entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have\nlabeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in\nthe Fed funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nLast March, as the Fed gave notice that TALF would be expanded, we also announced a considerable increase in the size of\nanother program, our large–scale asset purchases in which we buy agency debt, agency-guaranteed mortgage–backed securities,\nand Treasury securities. These actions, taken together, represented a substantial escalation of our nontraditional policies, and\nthey will probably maintain or increase the size of our balance sheet well above what it was until a year ago.\nI think this aggressive move was appropriate considering the many risks we were facing, the direness of some forecasts, and the\nuncertainty surrounding our new tools. Future developments will help us determine if our actions to date have been too much,\ntoo little, or just right.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper\ndesign required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take\ntime to affect economic activity. So I expect to see further deterioration in some areas, notably job market conditions, before\n\n\four policies gain full traction. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest\nactions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as\ninadequate.\nOver time the degree of success of specific programs will let us reconsider the size of our actions. If we find that a given\nprogram is not proving as useful as we anticipated, we would be faced with a choice between making its terms more attractive\n(and taking on more risk) or letting it lapse. We will then need to keep in mind that the same level of aggressiveness may not\nbe warranted by the circumstances of the day. Indeed, the possibility that the economy is close to a turning point is stronger\nnow than just two months ago. Financial market spreads have improved even as long Treasury and mortgage rates have\nincreased. And disinflationary pressures have been weaker than we had feared. Part of rightsizing will be to decide where\nboldness ends.\nBack to normal\n\nOver time, as the economy moves toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the Fed will progressively return to its\ntraditional policies—that is, setting the Fed funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short–term loans, so as these programs come to\nan end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to\nbe unattractive in normal times, and attractive only to those who really need them in these unusual times. As they cease to be\nuseful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being used less and we should see that trend continue as\nconditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to\nreduce it actively so that monetary policy can be easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out as we\nwere on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our assets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse\nrepurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on\nreserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could\nrequire sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem\nwith our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the Fed funds rate near the target. Finally,\nas we announced in March, we are seeking with the help of the Treasury additional tools through legislative action. An example\nof such tools would be the authority to issue interest–bearing debt in exchange for reserves or an expansion of the\nSupplementary Financing Program.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance\nsheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast in a matter of weeks last fall, and\nremains large. There are historical precedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit\nexpansion and to be subsequently associated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: inflationary\npressures will not arise without broader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present. Nevertheless, these\nprecedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the growth in our balance\nsheet.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the\nremarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast\nfor 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two\nconflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of\ncapacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed,\nsome statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent\nwe might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely consumers' and businesses' expectations of\nfuture inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise\nconsidering the severity of the downturn. But as economic conditions improve consumers and businesses might expect upward\npressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation expectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many\neconomic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, with core inflation near 2 percent, I see inflation at a level that would be acceptable under normal circumstances.\nBut these two potentially strong forces work in opposite directions, and the Fed must be in a position to respond, whichever\nforce dominates.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from\ntraditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety\nof risks we faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends remain\n\n\funchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable growth, and\nprice stability. As economic conditions improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction in our balance sheet, these\nends remain uppermost in our minds.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

Extraordinary disruptions in the flow of credit and\nliquidity have weighed on the economies in the United States, Central and Eastern Europe, and around the world. As events\nhave unfolded over the past 20 months, the Federal Reserve, together with the United States Treasury and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), has implemented a broad range of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in our financial\nsystem and the fallout on the rest of the economy.\nI believe that our interventions are helping to address the difficulties we face and to eventually move the United States back to\nfinancial stability and economic recovery. And, as you are all well aware, capital flows are international. So, these efforts should\nalso be positive factors for financial markets and economic activity around the world.\nToday I will concentrate my remarks on the Fed's responses to the liquidity and credit shocks that have affected the U.S.\nfinancial system. I will also discuss the challenges that lie ahead and our continued commitment to confront them. I should\nnote that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCredit and liquidity shocks\n\nTrouble began in 2007, when falling housing prices and rising mortgage defaults produced strains in the market for securitized\nmortgages. As a result, many financial institutions reported severe losses. Famous names such as Bear Stearns, Wachovia,\nWashington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG), were on that list. Some of\nthese firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear\nStearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange\nloans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps\nwritten by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses, no sale or loan support could be made\nat suitable terms. As a result, Lehman went into bankruptcy last September.\nLehman Brothers' bankruptcy intensified market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as\nover the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money\nmarket industry. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these redemptions,\nsome funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThe disruptions in the money market industry were the product of two main shocks: a credit shock and a liquidity shock. First,\nbecause of deteriorating economic conditions, market participants expected greater losses on commercial paper and other\nshort-term securities. This is what I refer to as a \"credit shock.\" Second, the ease of trading these securities worsened:\ntransaction volumes shrank dramatically, and in some cases it was even difficult to obtain price quotes. This is what I call a\n\"liquidity shock.\" The two shocks are not independent, as deteriorating liquidity conditions can spillover to produce higher\nlosses among market participants. The interplay between credit and liquidity shocks made it difficult for firms to issue all but\nthe safest and most liquid commercial paper. Only very short-term, often overnight, debt was issued when market conditions\nwere at their worst.\nIt is easy to see the role that \"flight to quality\" played in these events. And I would like to underscore that \"flight to liquidity\"\nalone was sufficiently severe to disrupt the functioning of some markets that were largely immune from credit shocks. For\nexample, in the United States many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite these guarantees,\nliquidity disruptions have nearly shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a\ngood deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities\nbacked by student loans. A second example is the market for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Like other Treasury\nsecurities, TIPS benefit from the guarantee of the federal government. Yet, in past months they have traded at a significant\ndiscount relative to more liquid (on-the-run) nominal Treasuries.\n\n\fMonetary policy in exceptional times\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to these extraordinary events. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has lowered the target for the federal funds rate—our standard overnight interest rate policy lever—\nbringing it to essentially zero in December of last year. In addition, we have made adjustments to make it more attractive for\nbanks to borrow from the discount window.\nHowever, financial distress, the weak outlook for growth, and the prospects for unusually low inflation call for more policy\naccommodation. With the funds rate near zero, the Fed has had to work to find new ways to inject monetary accommodation\ninto the economy.\nOne way to make monetary policy more accommodating is to work to lower the unusual liquidity and risk premia that are\nraising private and longer-term borrowing costs. In this arena, the Federal Reserve has adopted several innovative policies that\nare providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets.\nSome of these policies were aimed at easing the liquidity pressures I spoke about earlier that hit the money market funds and\ncommercial paper markets last fall. Two important ones were the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (or MMIF) and the\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).\nMost recently, a new joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, became\neffective on March 19. The first lending through this temporary facility is designed to make credit available to consumers and\nsmall businesses on more favorable terms by facilitating the issuance of new asset-backed securities (ABS) and improving the\nmarket conditions for ABS more generally. The TALF is providing financing to investors to support their purchases of certain\nhighly-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Purchasers of these ABS will be able to borrow from the TALF, using the\nsecurities themselves as collateral.\nThe ABS market has typically played a critical role in providing credit to U.S. consumers and small businesses. However, this\nmarket has virtually closed since the worsening of the financial crisis last October. The TALF is aimed at re-opening this\nmarket by helping lenders finance new issues. Moreover, the program provides a lending backstop that will enhance the\nliquidity value of TALF-eligible securities. Since the announcement of the TALF, liquidity conditions in these securities have\nalready improved. It is important to note that the TALF loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably\nlonger than those available through other Fed lending facilities. So, TALF can impact longer-run interest rates.\nAnother important feature of the TALF is that the terms on these loans are attractive during current market conditions but are\nmore costly than those that prevail during more normal times. So, TALF loans will become unattractive when conditions\nimprove in markets for traditional sources of funding. Appropriate haircuts on the collateral and funding from the Treasury\nprovide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. For instance, the Fed already is\nundertaking a substantial expansion of the TALF. Last Thursday we added four new categories to the list of TALF-eligible ABS.\nAnd yesterday an expansion of the TALF to legacy assets was announced, with the new assets expected to include non-agency\nresidential and commercial mortgaged-backed securities.\nMoreover, on March 18 the FOMC decided to further increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by purchasing up\nto $1.15 trillion of additional securities, comprising (up to) $300 billion of longer-term Treasuries, (up to) $750 billion more of\nagency mortgage-backed securities, and (up to) $100 billion more of agency debt. Prices of Treasuries jumped sharply after the\nFOMC announcement, with the ten-year yield falling nearly 50 basis points over the day.\nTogether with the Treasury and the FDIC, the Fed earlier had also taken exceptional measures to attenuate the effect of the\ncredit shock. For example, we provided assistance to JPMorgan Chase in the acquisition of Bear Stearns, and we arranged the\nring-fencing of some non-performing assets held by Citi and Bank of America. Moreover, we provided capital to support the\npurchase of some collateralized debt obligations and the unwinding of AIG's credit default swap positions.\nAdditional interventions to deal with the credit crisis are being implemented. For instance, there is the Treasury's Financial\nStability Plan. The plan includes a Capital Assistance Program to strengthen U.S. financial institutions so that they have\nsufficient lending capacity to better support economic recovery. The plan also includes a Public-Private Investment Program,\naimed at providing greater means for financial institutions to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as\n\"legacy\" assets. Many of the details of this program were released yesterday, including the expansion of the Fed's TALF to\nlegacy assets that I just mentioned.\nWhen economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the\nFed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this\nwind-down process will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features\n\n\fof these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have\nbeen put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with\nbetter economic and financial performance.\nConceptual motivations for these new initiatives\n\nLet me briefly step back and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage\nmoves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets.\nThis is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing\nrates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. When financial markets are functioning well, the Fed can focus on the\nsize of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Because of balancesheet capacity limitations, or because of higher-than-normal uncertainty and risk aversion, market participants are largely\navoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For instance, as I mentioned previously, liquidity disruptions have made it\ndifficult to attract investors to several types of securities backed by student loans, even in the presence of a federal government\nguarantee.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in\nto take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. If they were, they could ease liquidity\npressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this market segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less\nlikely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus can significantly improve that market's functioning, seeding its transition to\nmore normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for focusing our nontraditional policies on loans and securities\nthat affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets that are not the\nparticular focus of policy intervention could experience some relative disadvantage because of the segmentation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Market participants\nwill become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and segmentation will diminish. This will diminish both\nthe need and usage of the special programs we have created.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over\ntime and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nThe programs I discussed today will help improve credit and liquidity conditions in U.S. financial markets. Since capital flows\nare international, these initiatives have the potential to positively impact capital markets around the world as well.\nThe Federal Reserve has also worked together with other countries to address pressures in global money markets directly. For\ninstance, the Fed has established temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with several nations' central banks.\nThese facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets and to make it easier to obtain U.S.\ndollar funding.\nOther international efforts are in place to provide direct support to countries that have been particularly affected by the\nfinancial crisis. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided funds to several Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries, including Latvia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Belarus; and Romania is in talks with the IMF. Moreover, the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group, and the World Bank\nGroup recently pledged to provide up to €24.5 billion to support the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe and to\nfund lending to businesses hit by the global economic crisis.\n\nConclusions\n\nModern economic theories usually imply that there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in\ntechnology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This logic would carry\nover to financial shocks as well, if we chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that policy has a very different role to play in mitigating the impact of financial shocks.\nFor one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the financial intermediation process. This means\nthere could be alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\nSince August 2007, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated to deal with the \"adverse feedback loop\" between\ndisruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced not only the setting of the funds rate,\nbut also the implementation of several new policies aimed directly at the financial shocks, some of which I have discussed\ntoday.\nI believe these initiatives will help in restoring the normal functioning of the financial system. They will also have a stabilizing\neffect on markets around the world and will therefore eventually help stimulate worldwide economic recovery.\n\n\fNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

And thank you, Einar Forsman, [President and CEO of\nthe Rockford Chamber of Commerce], for that kind introduction.\nCurrently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the\nlarge downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Many manufacturing-intensive\ncommunities, like Rockford, have been particularly hard hit. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the\noutlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these\nare, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBackground\n\nOver the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial\nservices industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a\nsignificant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six\nmonths. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and to bolster aggregate demand. As you know,\nyesterday, the President signed the $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill. And last week, the Treasury recommended new proposals to\ndeal with the financial sector problems. These actions, I believe, will help in addressing the difficulties we face and in moving\nus toward financial stability and economic recovery.\nThese certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages.\nThe problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and\nthe prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital\npositions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the\nfall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets,\ndeclines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities.\nThese factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\nA series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses. Famous\nnames like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group\n(AIG) were on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial\ninstitutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the\nTreasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had\nexposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last\nSeptember, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\nThese developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as\nthe ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money\nmarket industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to commercial paper and other short-term credit markets.\nWorried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate\nassets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThis process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls\nthrough these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been\nable to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system,\nsqueezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\n\fActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in\nthe financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its standard monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last\nyear.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more\nhad to be done to facilitate market functioning.\nAt first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—\nwhich is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\nGiven the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to\ndirectly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions. The Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the\neconomy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nMost of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that\nengage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo\nmarket. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a\nnumber of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—\ngenerally not more than 90 days.\nMore recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began\npurchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage\nmarkets.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and\nbegan to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies.\nCongress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets\nRelief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial\nsystem to support the lending capacity of banks.\nLast week, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the Plan is to combine public and\nprivate capital in an effort to value illiquid assets and move them off of banks' balance sheets.\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are\nbeginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for\ninterbank lending, and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate, have come down appreciably since October\nparticularly at the one-month maturity. More than $150 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating\nmedium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have\ndeclined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity riskfree government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect\nspreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing shortly before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly\nunderpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\nOver the longer run, policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets\nwill help move us toward a new benchmark and more stable financial conditions. This will not be an easy process, and it could\ntake time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until\nthey do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated\nsignificantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6\npercent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and home prices\nhave led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our\nexports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more\npessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by\ninvestors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending\ncommitments.\n\n\fTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending.\nOverall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a\n3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter—moreover, recent data suggest that the revisions will make this figure even worse. Last\nquarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate,\nand consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the\nrecessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Although\npreliminary data for January were positive for retail sales, there continues to be weakness in housing starts, employment, and\nauto sales. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will\nbegin to expand later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup\nreflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the\nstrains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In\naddition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full impact is still unclear, and our forecast could need\nsome recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the\npace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see\ngrowth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment\nrate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food\nand energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy\nand other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity.\nLooking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood\nof some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases.\nConsequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over\nthe longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the\nneighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that\ninflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\nSome Perspectives on Policy\n\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to\ncombat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus\nstimulates aggregate demand.\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With\nthe fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary\npressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to\nimpart monetary stimulus to the economy.\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and\ncommunications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions\nmade by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual,\nendorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an\nanchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising\nprivate and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena,\nadopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if\nnecessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities\nLoan Facility, or TALF. And last week the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF.\nAlthough not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the\ndemand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a\ndepressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the\nTALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus\nTALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large\nhaircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our\nother lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\n\n\fI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the\npurchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly\neffective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\nLet me step back for a minute and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system,\narbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across\nmarkets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect\nborrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the\nliquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balancesheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely\navoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal\ngovernment. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate securities markets that\nstudent loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in\nattracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in\nto take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity\npressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to\nleak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal,\nseeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies\nfocus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is\nthat markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Financial firms will\nbecome more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need\nand effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over\ntime and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the\nsize of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate.\nSome of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design\nfeatures of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities\nthat have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated\nwith better economic and financial performance.\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses\nduring the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending\nfacilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us\nto continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability\nworldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and\nother governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its\ndifficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.
