        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nShould Monetary Policy Prevent Bubbles?\nConference Banque de France - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\"Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy\"\nParis, France\nI would like to thank Deputy Governor Jean Pierre Landau, Benoit Mojon, and the Banque de France for organizing this timely\nconference on asset price bubbles and monetary policy. And I would like to thank two of our Chicago Fed staffers—Jonas\nFisher and Gadi Barlevy—who helped Benoit put together such an interesting program. It's been a pleasure for me to be in the\naudience, and now, I will share my thoughts with you on this important topic.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe financial crisis we have experienced during the past two years has challenged the conventional view on how monetary\npolicy should respond to asset price movements. Before the crisis, the common view was that a central bank should not react\nto asset price movements, except to the extent that they affect forecasts for inflation and the output gap. A central bank would\ninstead stand ready to respond if and when a collapse in the prices of some assets threatened its ability to meet its policy\nmandates. Now, in the aftermath of the crisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to\nsigns that an asset bubble may have emerged. This notion is often described as an imperative to \"lean against a bubble,\"\nmeaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high.\nToday, I would like to offer my position on this question. I agree that the severity of the recent crisis argues against simply\nwaiting and mopping up after the fact if and when the prices of some assets do collapse. But the type of proactive response by\na central bank that I envision is not well captured by the expression \"leaning against a bubble.\" I prefer to see policy reacting to\napparent exuberance in asset markets and the problematic risk exposure this could create, rather than initiating action out of a\nstrong conviction that these particular assets are overvalued. In addition, the expression \"leaning against a bubble\" evokes\npolices that are aimed at achieving some targeted decline in asset prices. In contrast, I view the goal of intervention as insuring\nthat exuberance in asset markets does not ultimately threaten the financial system or contribute to financial distress.\nLet me elaborate. This will help explain why the conventional view of how policy ought to respond to bubbles has changed in\nthe wake of the financial crisis. The original case for why central banks should not respond to bubbles relies on two arguments.\nThe first holds that it is virtually impossible to determine whether an asset is trading above its fundamental value, certainly not\nin real time and often not even after the fact.1 The second argument holds that monetary policy as a tool is too blunt to prick\nbubbles effectively. This is because monetary policy cannot be targeted precisely, and will affect other financial and\nmacroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. In addition, the typical changes in interest rates that a\ncentral bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices.2\nDoes the recent crisis justify revising this view? On the one hand, the crisis has certainly taught us a great deal about asset\nprice booms and busts. We've learned, for example, that we must be attuned to the warning signs that might indicate potential\ndangers in housing markets.3 But does this mean we should be more confident in our ability to easily and definitively sort out\nin real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is associated with overvaluation? I am skeptical. Each new episode is likely\nto involve its own idiosyncratic features—enough to bring a new chorus proclaiming that \"this time it is different\" and arguing\nthat we are not in fact facing a bubble. As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff remind us in their recent book, this pattern has\nbeen going on for at least eight centuries.4 As for the bluntness of monetary policy tools, I don't think the crisis has\ndemonstrated that the typical levers of monetary policy are any less blunt than we used to think.\nInstead, it seems it is the severity of the crisis, and the desire to not let one like it reoccur, that has encouraged people to\ncontemplate alternative policy responses. Certainly, the crisis ought to have sobered us to the thought that asset price collapses\nare always sufficiently manageable after the fact. But if the ultimate desire is to reduce the likelihood of such crises, our policy\nresponse should focus on achieving financial stability rather than on identifying and purging asset bubbles per se. An\nappropriate policy response may entail responding to bubbles, but I would argue that this should only be a means to achieving\nthe broader goal of financial stability, rather than an end in and of itself. Indeed, I am concerned that some policies may not\nreceive enough attention if we frame the lessons from the recent crisis too narrowly in terms of leaning against a bubble.\n\n\fSo what steps should we take to reduce the chances of another financial crisis? Part of the answer lies in structural\nprescriptions. The formulation of such frameworks will not be easy, and would greatly benefit from further research on how\nfinancial markets interact with real economic activity. Researchers in both macroeconomics and finance have a good deal of\nwork to do on this score. But I am hopeful that this research can help identify which environments might best reduce the\nchance that financial markets trigger ruinous crises, as well as determine what policy instruments we should add to our toolkit.\nAt this point, I think that regulatory policy provides the most promise. For one, it is important to improve resolution\nprocedures for financial institutions in the event of insolvency. This includes requiring firms to formulate contingency plans\nthat would be used in the event of their failure. Doing so should reduce the chances that the collapse of a particular institution\nwill threaten the broader financial system. Just as importantly, these plans also would improve discussions between supervisors\nand institutions. This would facilitate horizontal reviews and in so doing help first identify and then reduce potential systemic\nrisk exposures.\nAt the same time, maintaining financial stability is also likely to involve more-proactive, state-contingent measures, that is,\npolicies that vary with economic conditions. For example, when faced by several indications that asset markets may be\nexuberant, we might consider increasing capital requirements. This might be either for financial institutions as a whole or for\nspecific institutions that choose to hold assets for which there is concern of a price collapse. These requirements should serve\nas a cushion if purchases of these assets result in losses. They may also end up putting downward pressure on asset prices and,\nat some point, even eliminate speculative excesses. Here I have in mind theories of bubbles that are due to so-called agency\nproblems, where those who trade assets are acting as agents on behalf of others and cannot be perfectly monitored. These\nmodels, such as the models in the papers presented at the conference by Gadi Barlevy and Xavier Ragot, suggest that forcing\nagents to stake more of their own resources could provide a strong disincentive for market participants to purchase overvalued\nassets, possibly deflating a bubble that has already emerged.5\nThat said, it is important to stress that lowering asset prices would not be the direct intent of these policies and, therefore, not\nthe way we should judge their success. We should consider an intervention successful if it helps to safeguard financial\ninstitutions and the real economy in the event that asset prices collapse, not if it manages to lower asset prices to better reflect\nthe true worth of the underlying assets. In fact, we are unlikely to ever know if we accomplished the latter.\nOne advantage of using financial stability as our metric is that it does not require a central bank to take a stand on whether the\nassets in question are overvalued. Rather, the responses would be implemented whenever there are concerns that asset prices\nmay experience a sharp decline in the future, regardless of whether this decline is driven by fundamentals or by the bursting of\nan asset bubble.\nI should note that some policymakers have recently expressed openness to the notion of leaning against bubbles. The proposals\nI just outlined are not out of scope with some of their thinking. This is because they, too, often give regulatory policy a\nprominent role.6 Thus, while I might motivate and describe the appropriate policy response somewhat differently, my\nrecommendation does not represent a radical departure from what others have argued.\nIn closing, let me return to the broader themes of the conference. In the past, economists used to debate whether bubbles were\neven possible. The research discussed here shows that there are conditions under which bubbles can unequivocally occur, even\namong fully rational market participants, and that in some cases it might be desirable to burst them. But what these papers do\nnot show is how central banks can reliably identify bubbles. The best they can offer are useful warning signs, such as those in\nthe paper that Carsten Detken will present tomorrow.7 As long as we can't detect bubbles with great confidence, it seems\nunwise to adopt fighting them as a policy objective, even if only sparingly. Instead, it seems better to commit to what central\nbanks are already mandated to do: preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system at all times, including when there\nis apparent exuberance in asset markets.\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer\nKrane, and Gadi Barlevy.\n1\n\nFor example, in Peter M. Garber, 2000, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias, Cambridge, MA: MIT\nPress, the author revisits three historical episodes that are commonly described as bubbles. Garber concludes that in all three,\nprice movements can be explained by changes in the expectations of fundamentals by market participants. Ellen McGrattan and\nEdward Prescott similarly argue that the rise in the stock market prior to the 1929 crash was not a bubble; see Ellen\nMcGrattan and Edward Prescott, 2003, \"Testing for stock market overvaluation/undervaluation,\" in Asset Price Bubbles: The\nImplications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael\nPomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 271–276.\n2\n\nThe notion of a policy being too blunt because it can affect many variables in addition to asset prices is usually attributed to\nBernanke and Gertler; see Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 1999, \"Monetary policy and asset price volatility,\" Economic\nReview, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 17–51. The notion of a policy being too blunt because it is\nineffective has been raised by Greenspan; see Alan Greenspan, 2002, \"Central bank perspectives on stabilization policy—\n\n\fArticles from the bank's Economic Policy Symposium, ‘Rethinking Stabilization Policy,’\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 5–12. See also Frederic S. Mishkin, 2008, \"How should we respond to asset price\nbubbles?,\" speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute's Annual Financial Risk Roundtable,\nPhiladelphia, May 15.\n3\n\nIn a November 2008 speech, Don Kohn offers an insightful discussion of how his view of asset bubbles was informed by the\ncrisis, including whether we can have advance warning that certain markets are subject to bubbles before the prices of these\nassets decline; see Donald L. Kohn, 2008, \"Monetary policy and asset prices revisited,\" speech at the Cato Institute's 26th\nAnnual Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC, November 19.\n4\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2009, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton, NJ:\nPrinceton University Press. Reinhart and Rogoff go on to argue that since these episodes are so similar, contrarian claims\nshould be refutable with evidence from various advance indicators of such crises. By contrast, Caballero and Kurlat argue that\ncrises are nearly impossible to predict; see Ricardo J. Caballero and Pablo Kurlat, 2009, \"The ‘surprising’ origin and nature of\nfinancial crises: A macroeconomic policy proposal,\" paper at the Economic Policy Symposium, Financial Stability and\nMacroeconomic Policy, Jackson Hole, WY, August 20–22. This debate underscores the point I wish to make: that making the\ncase that we are facing a bubble is likely to be difficult, since it will always be possible to argue about the relevance of\nindicators that predicted crises in the past.\n5\n\nGadi Barlevy, 2009, \"A leverage–based model of speculative bubbles,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13; and Simon Dubecq, Benoit Mojon, and\nXavier Ragot, 2009, \"Risk shifting, fuzzy capital requirements and the build up of financial fragility,\" paper at Banque de France\nand Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13. The original\nwork on bubbles and agency problems was done by Franklin Allen and Gary Gorton, 1993, \"Churning bubbles,\" Review of\nEconomic Studies, Vol. 60, No. 4, pp. 813–836, and Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale, 2000, \"Bubbles and crises,\" Economic\nJournal, Vol. 110, No. 460, pp 236–255; however, they do not emphasize the role of capital requirements in avoiding bubbles\nin these papers.\n6\n\nSee William Dudley 2009, \"Lessons learned from the financial crisis,\" remarks at the Eighth Annual BIS conference, Basel,\nSwitzerland; Gary H.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nThe International Financial Crisis: Asset Price Exuberance and\nMacroprudential Regulation\n2009 International Banking Conference\nChicago, IL\nThank you, Justin. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. On behalf of the World Bank\nand everyone here at the Chicago Fed, it's my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\nOver the years, this conference has served as a valuable forum for the discussion of current issues affecting global financial\nmarkets, such as international regulatory structures, the globalization of financial markets, systemic risk, and the problems\ninvolved with the resolution of large, globally active banks. Also, we have been fortunate to have leading academics, regulators,\nand industry executives participate in the various venues—providing valuable perspectives and enriching the discussions on the\nissues.\nThis year's theme is the international financial crisis. If you look back at the past conferences, you will see that the most\ncommon theme over the years deals with various aspects of financial crises. After looking over this year's program, I want to\ncompliment the organizers from both the World Bank and the Chicago Fed for putting together a very impressive group of\nexperts in the current debate on how best to reduce the probability of another financial crisis, and, if one should occur, how to\nrespond. I look forward to the next two days and believe you will find the discussion cutting edge and useful for deciding how\nwe as a global financial community should move forward. Again, on behalf of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago, enjoy the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\nBefore I turn the podium over to Doug, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the theme of this year's conference—financial crisis—\nwith an emphasis on the oversight of financial markets. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those\nof the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWhen thinking about the events of the past couple of years, what comes to mind most often, or the big \"take away\" from all of\nthis, is that we don't ever want to find ourselves in this situation again.\nIf we are committed to that outcome, we should ask ourselves, first, how can policies be changed so that in the future, it will be\nmuch less likely that systemically important financial institutions will find themselves in crisis situations? And, second, if such\ncrises do occur, how can we best contain them, preventing them from having a major impact on the rest of the economy as in\nthe recent crisis? Surely, prevention should form our first and strongest line of defense and remedial, or containment, policies\nshould form the second.\nI recently gave a speech to the European Economic and Financial Center on the issues associated with too-big-to-fail. I argued\nthat in the current regulatory environment it is unrealistic to expect that regulators would allow the uncontrolled failure of a\nlarge, complicated, and interconnected financial institution—certainly not if they had the ability to avoid it and if there were\nsystemic ramifications to the failure. If you accept this premise, and I believe the failure of Lehman Brothers is the\ncounterexample that proves it, then it becomes imperative to construct an environment that prevents our economic and\nfinancial system from again reaching the crisis state we have seen over this past year.\nIn my earlier speech I stressed the need for policy reforms, such as the introduction of an orderly and efficient failure\nresolution process that would create a credible regulatory environment in which firms and their creditors would not expect\nrescues or bailouts. This would reduce the moral hazard issues associated with the too-big-to-fail perception. It also would\nbetter align the incentives of the stakeholders of financial firms with those of society at large. In addition it would allow a\nlarger role for financial markets to oversee and regulate firm behavior. However, even though I think we can significantly\nstrengthen the role of market discipline, regulation will continue to play a very important role in ensuring financial stability.\nThe kinds of events that lead to our recent interventions inevitably occur during periods of financial exuberance. One way or\nanother, asset prices rise beyond conservative fundamental valuations and risk premiums fall well below appropriate\ncompensation levels. We typically use the loose term \"asset price bubble\" to describe such situations. Although I will continue\nthat tradition, we should keep in mind that not all increases in asset prices represent departures from fundamentals, and not all\nasset bubbles need be disruptive.1 Definitions aside, it seems clear that we need to find a way to deal with potential exuberance\nin financial markets if we want to ensure financial stability.\n\n\fSome seven years ago, at an earlier International Banking Conference, which was also cosponsored by the World Bank, we\ndiscussed the implications of asset bubbles.2 The typical view expressed at the conference, which aligned well with much of the\nresearch literature at the time, was that central banks should not use monetary policy tools to \"manage\" or lean against the\ninflated prices associated with asset bubbles. In the event of a sudden collapse in asset prices, central banks were expected to\nrespond with their standard policy tools to address any adverse impact on real economic activity. In other words, monetary\npolicy should be prepared to \"clean up\" ex post rather than try to prevent ex ante a run-up in asset prices.3\nHowever, given the enormous costs of the recent financial crisis, as well as new research suggesting an increase in the\nfrequency and amplitude of asset price cycles,4 many commentators are reassessing the proper role of the central bank in\nmonitoring and trying to deflate rising asset prices.\nIn reevaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy for this purpose, two approaches are typically considered. One is for the\ncentral bank to take an activist role and directly incorporate asset price fluctuations into its monetary policy deliberations—that\nis, explicitly putting asset prices into the policy response function and \"leaning against the wind.\" As an alternative,\npolicymakers could incorporate asset prices into the price indexes used in determining the future direction of monetary policy.\nWhile recent events have indeed imposed significant costs on society, I fear that monetary policy tools may be too blunt for\nsuch a fine-tuning policy.5 Central bankers have imperfect information, and for many asset classes, sudden price declines may\nhave minimal impact on the real economy.6 So, my concern is that using monetary policy to \"lean against bubbles\" could end\nup causing more harm to the economy than good.\nTo elaborate a bit, taking an activist role would likely have policy aim at explicitly hitting some target range for asset prices or\nrisk premiums. So, we would first have to determine those target ranges. I don't know of any economic theory or empirical\nevidence we currently have in hand that would give us adequate guidance here. In addition, there is the \"bluntness\" of monetary\npolicy. Using wide-reaching monetary policy to slow the growth of certain asset prices could have significant adverse effects on\nother sectors of the economy. In normal times, we use our policy instrument, the short-term federal funds rate, to try to\nachieve our dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Adding a third target—asset prices—\nwould likely mean we couldn't do as well on the other two.\nThe desirability of incorporating asset prices into the inflation measures targeted by central banks is also not obvious. Some\nclaim that standard consumer price indexes do not adequately incorporate inflationary expectations; rather, they only account\nfor past price adjustments. Certain asset prices, for example, those of equities or real estate, may better incorporate such\nexpectations. Thus, some argue that to the extent these asset prices are predictors of future price changes, including them in\nthe target price indexes provides a reasonable operating procedure that leans against rising asset prices and adds an automatic\nstabilizer to monetary policy.\nOne potential issue with this argument is whether real estate or equity market prices accurately forecast future inflation rates.\nA bigger question, however, is how to operationalize such an index. What weights should be assigned to asset prices in the\naggregate indexes? Index number theory provides the conceptual linkage between utility maximization and the expenditure\nweights used to construct consumer price indexes. I have not yet seen the theoretical work that says how to include asset prices\nin an aggregate index. I am open-minded to new research making the case for using monetary policy to address asset inflation.\nBut as of now, I am skeptical.7\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that central banks have to deal with asset price swings and their potentially\ndisruptive consequences. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market infrastructure offer more promising paths\nto increased financial stability. This is the \"prevention\" that forms the first line of defense in our efforts to never be in this\nposition again. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to avoid all of the market events that help to create excessive\nexuberance, but it should play a very large role in controlling the existence, size, and consequences of any bubble. For example,\nresearch suggests that a crisis caused by sudden declines in asset prices is less disruptive to markets when financial systems and\nindividual bank balance sheets are in sound condition before the crisis.8 Better supervision and a sound regulatory\ninfrastructure can increase the resiliency of markets and institutions, enabling them to better withstand adverse shocks.\nHow do we promote such increased resiliency? First, we can make more effective use of our existing regulatory structure, tools,\nand authority. And second, a number of reforms of our current infrastructure—both market and regulatory—may help us to\nbetter address the type of problems we saw emerge during the recent crisis.\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient financial markets, either through\nrule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private initiatives.9 They can also encourage more and better disclosure of\ninformation—a key element of effective risk management.\nRegulators and supervisors are also often in positions to foresee emerging problems before they grow into crises. Along these\nlines, supervisors can do more \"horizontal supervision,\" similar to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) that was\ndesigned for the largest 19 U.S. banks. Using procedures similar to those in SCAP, the likely performance of banks can be\n\n\fevaluated on a consistent basis under alternative stress scenarios. In addition to evaluating resiliency to future conditions, this\ntype of \"stress test\" also enables supervisors to identify best practices in risk management and to push banks with weak risk\nmanagement to improve.10\nWhen emerging issues or practices that could lead to disruptions are identified, regulators can more effectively use tools such\nas memorandums of understanding or supervisory directives to dampen the adverse impact of a variety of financial shocks.11\nIndeed, we probably should have been more aggressive in utilizing this supervisory power during the period leading up to the\nrecent crisis. It can be an effective and powerful tool.\nAlthough I believe we can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, we may also need to address the shortcomings of\ncurrent regulations. Already policymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring a variety of reforms.12\nIntroducing a systemic regulator who can identify, monitor, and collate information on industry practices across various\ninstitutions tops most of the reform agendas. While plans for systemic regulation vary in the structures they propose—for\nexample, a single regulator versus a committee of regulators—they all envision macroprudential supervision and regulation as\nthe key mandate of the new regulator. This would be a major component of what I called our first line of defense.\nReform proposals also typically include ways in which we can make capital requirements more dynamic and tailor them to the\ntype of risks an institution poses for the financial system. Varying capital requirements and loan loss provisions over the cycle\nare examples of these proposals. History shows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant\nstate, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions. During downturns, faced with\neroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and binding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and\nexcessively tighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Allowing the required capital ratio to\nvary over the cycle could serve to offset some of this volatility and to partially offset the boom–bust trends we have seen in the\npast.\nVarying loan loss provisions over the cycle is an alternative or complementary way to better cushion firms against sudden\ndeclines in asset prices.\nCapital requirements also could be adjusted by extending risk-based weighting schemes to account for institutions'\ncontributions to systemic risk. This could involve higher risk weights based on factors such as institution size and the extent of\noff-balance-sheet activities. It might also include some assessment of the degree to which the institution was interconnected\nwith others. Such adjustments to capital requirements would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect\ntheir impact on society. The information needed to account for the new risk factors—for example, the degree of\ninterconnectedness—fits well within the framework of information that would be required by a new systemic regulator, and is\nnow being considered in regulatory reform proposals in the U.S.\nSo, in order to fortify our first line of defense, we must make more effective use of the existing regulatory structure and tools,\nintroduce a systemic risk regulator, and reform capital requirements to make them more dynamic and tailored to systemic\nrisks. But adjustments to the current regulations and infrastructure alone are probably not enough. We also need to fortify our\nsecond line of defense—containing the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of systemically important institutions\nwithout resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A necessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a\nsystemically important institution. This is something we currently lack in many cases, though there are proposals now under\ndiscussion that would provide this resolution power.13\nAnother reform proposal that I think can play an important role in the resolution process of systemically important institutions\nis what is typically referred to as a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan. Under this proposal, systemically important institutions would be\nrequired to provide the information necessary to determine how their failures could be handled in a relatively short period of\ntime, as well as to design a plan to efficiently implement such a resolution.14 I see a number of ways these plans can fortify\nboth our first and second lines of defense.\nRequiring systemically important institutions to identify and think through their organizational structure and interactions with\nvarious parties can improve the risk-management practices of their institutions. By developing plans to address systemic\nproblem areas ex ante, the need for an ex post \"too-big-to-fail\" action could be reduced.\nIn addition, should the first line of defense fail, these plans could provide an initial blueprint for the resolution of large\ninterconnected institutions and, in so doing, improve our second line of defense. Currently, individual institutions may not\nhave an incentive to make such plans—after all, they would bear the costs of the planning and see little of the benefits.15 But,\nsociety as a whole would benefit from such contingency planning. Another way to cushion financial firms against sudden asset\nprice declines would be to require them to hold contingent capital.16 Under these proposals, systemically important banks\nwould be required to issue \"contingent capital certificates.\" These would be issued as debt securities that would be converted\ninto equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.17 It would provide firms with an additional equity injection\nat the very time that equity would be difficult to issue, thus enabling firms to better withstand sudden shocks and potential\nspillover effects.\n\n\fThese new policy options, while not easy to implement, would enhance the ability of banks and other financial intermediaries\nto survive shocks—whether from a sudden fall in asset prices or from some other source. I am fully aware that the challenges\nin reforming regulatory structures and practices are not insignificant. But, given the magnitude of the cost incurred in the wake\nof the recent crisis and the possible benefits that would arise from making our economy more resilient to such events, it is\nimperative that we take on these challenges.\nThus, I think we need to strengthen our existing regulatory infrastructure and give strong consideration to making the\nadjustments that could reduce the likelihood of a crisis similar in magnitude to the one we have seen over the past two years.\nWe also need to devise mechanisms to dampen the adverse effects of any disruption that might occur.\nThis year, as in others, this conference invites us to examine and discuss financial crises and asks whether the rules of finance\nhave changed. I've argued that in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the past two years; we need to fortify\nour regulatory lines of defense. We need to have the rules of regulation change. Not necessarily through more regulation, but\nthrough better regulation that is more efficient and effective in its design and implementation. I hope this conference serves as\na platform to inform your thinking and stimulate good debate about the issues I've laid out.\nThank you.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nEvidence of the disagreement concerning what constitutes an asset bubble can be found in Peter M.

Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA:\nMIT Press.\n2\n\nSee William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), 2003, Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for\nMonetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (hereafter HKP).\n3\n\nSee Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 2001, \"Should central banks respond to movements in asset prices?,\" American\nEconomic Review, Vol. 91, No. 2, May, pp. 253–257; Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist, 1999, \"The financial\naccelerator in a quantitative business cycle framework,\" in Handbook of Macroeconomics, Vol.1C, John Taylor and Michael\nWoodford (eds.), New York: Elsevier Science-North Holland, pp. 1341–1393. A quick aside, it should be emphasized that\npolicymakers do currently take asset bubbles into account to the extent that they affect the real sector of the economy. Thus, it\nis not a question of whether policymakers address bubbles. At issue is whether they should or can address asset price increases\nex ante to avoid a resulting sudden decline in prices that more adversely affects the real economy than would have occurred\nwithout the bubble.\n4\n\nFor example, see Randall Kroszner, 2003, \"Asset price bubbles, information, and public policy,\" in HKP, pp. 3–12; and\nClaudio Borio and Philip Lowe, 2003, \"Imbalances or bubbles? Implications for monetary and financial stability,\" in HKP, pp.\n247–263.\n5\n\nThere is broad literature on this issue.

Mishkin makes the argument that not all bubbles have the same impact on the real economy. In\nparticular, he argues that bubbles associated with credit booms are more dangerous because they put the financial system at\nrisk and may result in negative spillover effects for the real economy. Thus, these bubbles may deserve a more activist\napproach.\n7\n\nFor an alternative discussion of potential problems, see Trichet (2003) in footnote 5.\n\n8\n\nSee Frederic Mishkin and Eugene White, 2003, \"U.S. stock market crashes and their aftermath: Implications for monetary\npolicy,\" in HKP, pp. 53–76.\n9\n\nAn example here would be the central bank serving a coordinative role encouraging banks to address operational risks\nassociated with back-office operations in credit default swap contracts.\n\n\f10\n\nFor a further discussion of SCAP, see Daniel K.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nRemarks at Conference on Successful Strategies for Financial Literacy\nand Education\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nChicago, IL\nIntroduction\n\nGood morning. I'm Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and it's my pleasure to welcome\nyou to today's conference. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the importance of financial education, a\ntopic that is particularly relevant in light of the subprime crisis and the struggles that many families are facing to stay in their\nhomes.\nThis morning I would like to offer some observations on the importance of financial education, which is of particular concern\nto those of us at the Federal Reserve. I will also discuss the origins of Fed engagement in financial education and some\nsimilarities that I see between the economic and political climate that prompted the Fed to ramp up its financial education\nefforts in the 1970s and where we are today. I will close with some thoughts about the particular strengths that the Fed brings\nto the financial education arena.\n\nThe Importance of Financial Education\n\nRecent research shows that American consumers have relatively low rates of financial literacy. For example, two-thirds of older\nAmericans do not have a clear understanding of financial concepts like compound interest and inflation.1 Financial illiteracy is\nparticularly acute among specific demographic groups, including those with low education, women, African-Americans, and\nHispanics.\nIt is perhaps useful to consider why we think it is important for individuals to be financially literate. To my mind there are (at\nleast) two key reasons. First, if individuals are financially literate, then they will be able to make better financial decisions for\nthemselves and for their families when it comes to budgeting and buying, financing a home, or planning for retirement, for\nexample. Second, when individuals have a better understanding of financial and economic concepts, it is easier for them to\nappreciate the role of the Federal Reserve and the benefits of the Fed's independence when it comes to monetary policy. When\nyou don't understand what inflation is or the risk that it presents to your financial well-being, then it is difficult to appreciate\nthe importance of a Federal Reserve that can take politically unpopular steps to combat inflation.\nSince the 1970s the Federal Reserve has been actively involved in a variety of financial education programs. Of course, it is\ndesirable to know how helpful this instruction is, so we can assess whether programs are cost-effective and perhaps even\nworthy of being replicated broadly. However, evaluating financial education programs is far from a straightforward task—\nsimply looking at the outcomes of program participants can be misleading, because individuals choose whether or not to\nparticipate. For example, enrollees in credit counseling programs might make better mortgage contract choices. But the fact\nthat they choose to enroll reveals their interest in making good decisions about their personal finances. Thus, those particular\nindividuals might have made good choices even without attending a program.\nThe gold standard for dealing with such problems is randomized assignment, which ensures that individuals selected for\nprograms do not differ systematically from the target population. There are important examples of this type of work within the\nFederal Reserve, for example assessments of home ownership education and counseling at the Philadelphia Fed and other\nresearch that will be highlighted in the second panel. But randomized assignment evaluations are usually quite costly. They\nrequire very careful design, the ability to replicate that design, the political fortitude to exclude populations from treatment,\nand extensive follow-up. Moreover, most financial literacy programs—for instance, 2 hour credit counseling—offer small\ntreatments that are likely to produce small effects. Detecting such effects requires studying large populations, raising the cost of\nevaluations even further. So, for some financial literacy programs, such rigorous assessment may simply be impractical. One\nthing I hope we will get from this conference is a better sense of how we should approach the evaluation of such programs.\n\nOrigins of the Fed's Engagement in Financial Education\n\nI date the beginning of the Fed's engagement in economic and financial education to the mid-1970s.\nSo, what did the economic landscape of the mid-1970s look like? The economy had just gone through a severe recession,\nduring which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent. At the same time,\ninflation had been around 3 to 4 percent earlier in the decade, and then soared to more than 10 percent in 1975. The oil\n\n\fexport embargo by Arab states and President Nixon's wage and price controls combined to create long lines at the gas pump\nand restrictions on gas purchases. The oil price shock exacerbated a buildup of inflation and inflation expectations, which was\nfurther worsened by rapidly rising prices of agricultural products and other commodities.\nDuring this period, there were several Congressional attempts to curtail the Federal Reserve's independence. Sound familiar?\nIt was in this environment that the Federal Reserve grew increasingly concerned that the American public was uninformed\nabout the Federal Reserve's statutory responsibilities, especially its monetary policy role. By 1976, a consensus had developed\nwithin the Federal Reserve System that an expanded public information program was needed to reach a broader segment of the\nAmerican public and to dispel misconceptions about the Federal Reserve. This led the Fed to create a more professionally\norganized public information program at the Board and within the 12 Regional Reserve Banks. The recommended programs\nwere designed to move the Fed from a \"passive\" information stance to a more active posture by expanding the dissemination of\ninformation to as wide an audience as possible.\nThe education efforts focused initially on improving public understanding of the Federal Reserve's purposes and functions and\ninforming consumers of their rights and lenders of their responsibilities. Documents from the Fed at that time list several\ndiverse groups who would benefit from the Fed's public information and education efforts, including: bankers, members of\nCongress, representatives of electronic and print media, consumer advocates, educators, students, representatives of organized\nlabor, and the general public.2 Then as now, the audience was broad and diverse.\nAn expansion of public information programs, including economic education programs, began in earnest in the 1980s. During\nthis period, Reserve Banks across the country undertook a burgeoning array of initiatives and activities to facilitate public\nunderstanding of the Federal Reserve and developed greater coordination and information exchange throughout the System.\nEconomic education also became a specialty within public information programs, supporting the development of publications,\ncurricular materials, programs and Reserve Bank staff activities targeting K-12 educators and students.\nOver the past decade, the Fed's education initiatives have broadened to include an additional focus on financial education and\nliteracy. These initiatives concentrate on practical issues, such as: financial skill-building, economics education, bank account\nownership, financial planning, wealth accumulation, consumer protection, and foreclosures—issues that affect many people at\ndifferent stages of their lives.\nAs I'm sure you've noticed, there are some similarities between today and the environment of the mid-1970s. While we are\ntentatively emerging from a severe recession, unemployment remains high; thankfully, inflation and inflation expectations are\nunder control However, there is a similar lack of understanding of the role of the Federal Reserve, threats to its independence\nand various proposals that would change its functions.\nIn some respects, confusion over the Fed's role is quite understandable, given the unconventional steps we have taken over the\npast two years to ensure liquidity flows in the wake of the financial crisis and the non-traditional monetary policy environment\nthat we are in. At the same time, we have an important responsibility to explain our policy actions to a broad and diverse\npublic. Today, as in the past, the better the public understands the work of the Fed, the easier it will be for us to achieve our\nmission.\nWhat You Will to Get Out of this Conference\n\nToday's conference provides a timely and important opportunity to discuss what the regional Reserve Banks and the Board of\nGovernors are doing to ensure that the public understands the role of the Fed. The conference also offers an occasion for a\ndiscussion of what the Federal Reserve System is doing to provide opportunities for consumers to become better prepared to\nmake complicated financial decisions. During the course of the conference, you will have the opportunity to share strategies for\ndesigning successful programs and partnerships in financial education, to learn how regional Feds make the most of scarce\nresources, to hear about research on the effectiveness of various financial education efforts, as well as some of the challenges\ninvolved in measuring the impact of financial education programs generally. In addition, you will have the chance to learn from\npartners and potential partners about strengths and areas for improvement in the Fed's financial education efforts.\n\nOur Comparative Advantages\n\nLet me conclude my remarks by briefly highlighting why I think that the Federal Reserve has a critical and ongoing role to play\nin the field of financial education. First, as I've mentioned, the Fed has two very important reasons for working to increase\nfinancial literacy: wanting consumers to have the information and knowledge necessary to make good financial decisions and\nwanting the public to have a better appreciation of the role of the Fed.\nIn addition, the structure of the Federal Reserve—with the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—\nallows us to work effectively on both the regional and national levels. The regional Feds are ideally positioned to develop\nfinancial education programs that take into account the needs of their regions. For example, they can respond to variations in\nstate education standards and to regional economic conditions. In addition, they are adept at identifying strong partners in\ntheir communities.\n\n\fAt the same time, by working together with one another and with the Board of Governors, the regional Feds and the Federal\nReserve System can impact financial education at a national level. The Federal Reserve System provides an important\nindependent and unbiased source of financial and economic information, as well as a wide variety of opportunities for\nindividuals to build their financial literacy.\nLet me now turn the podium over to my colleague here in Chicago, Doug Tillett, who directs our Public Information and\nEconomic Education efforts and is moderating the opening panel of the conference.\nThank you again for coming to this timely and important conference. I hope you enjoy the conference and your stay in\nChicago.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\nNotes\n1\n\nAnnamaria Lusardi, 2008, \"Financial Literacy: An Essential Tool for Informed Consumer Choice?,\" Joint Center for Housing\nStudies, Harvard University, paper, February, No. UCC08-11.\n2\n\nLawrence K.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nThe Great Inflation 2.0 Debate\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, NY\nThanks for inviting me and thanks for that kind introduction. You'll note that I became president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago exactly two years ago. While I can assure you there's no correlation, this period has been among the\nmost interesting and extraordinary in the history of the Federal Reserve System. So much of what the Fed has done in the last\ntwo years has been under scrutiny from the government, the media, the general public and various others. And while the\ndebate has been loud and at times far ranging, our mandate from Congress has remained quite clear: the goal of the Fed and its\nmonetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to promote monetary and financial conditions that\nfacilitate the attainment of maximum employment and price stability. For about the last 30 years, there has typically been no\nconflict in pursuing each of these goals with a single tool—the short-term interest rate. This is because rising inflationary\npressures are often accompanied by unsustainably high growth, and economic slowdowns are typically associated with\ndisinflationary pressures.\nNevertheless, this simple description of the way monetary policy responds to growth and inflation prospects belies the fact that\ndiscussions within the FOMC often touch on a wide range of drivers for inflationary pressures. A small set of relevant factors\nshould include money growth, resource slack, inflationary expectations, energy and commodity price shocks, and assessments\nof the credibility of future policy commitments. And there is a surprising amount of disagreement and uncertainty over the\nexact roles forces play. I'm not talking out of school on this issue: A careful reading of FOMC transcripts over the last 20 years\nwill reveal many different views on inflation. Perhaps this is not surprising. The economics community itself continues to\ndebate strongly the importance of different transmission channels for inflation. Policymakers who are informed by these\ndevelopments—and, in many cases, have contributed to the scholarly research in this area—continue to have a healthy discourse\nover the issues and facts.\nDuring normal times, inflation evolves gradually, and this debate rarely spills over into major disagreements about policy. But,\ntoday, we are not in normal times. The inflation debate on the determinants of inflation has broken out on the front pages of\nnewspapers, with major disagreements among distinguished experts. For example, in recent New York Times op-eds Paul\nKrugman said that large resource gaps have made him worried about deflation, while Allan Meltzer said that massive growth in\nthe monetary base has made him worried about inflation.1\nCertainly, the stakes could not be higher. We have ample evidence of the harm that deflation can cause. The history of the U.S.\neconomy in the 1930s is a case in point, where the price level fell by over 25 percent,2 contributing to the severity of the\nGreat Depression. But, history also shows us the damage that high inflation can wreak on the U.S. economy. From 1965 to\n1980, inflation rose from about 1-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.3 Many economists refer to this period as the \"Great Inflation.\" The\ncostly process of breaking the Great Inflation and then, subsequently, the achievement of price stability took the better part of\nthe next 17 years.4 So it is quite disconcerting when highly regarded analysts talk about the possibility of another debilitating\ndeflation while others—just as highly regarded—suggest that even though we have avoided the Great Depression 2.0, the U.S.\neconomy may be facing the Great Inflation 2.0.\nThis morning, I would like to frame these two extreme views on inflation risks within the language economists and\npolicymakers use to discuss these issues. After highlighting the terms of these disagreements, I will provide some commentary\non the \"lessons learned\" from the historical record on inflation. In brief, I think neither a harmful deflationary episode nor a\nrepetition of the Great Inflation is very likely. Stimulative policies combined with the economy's resilient market forces will,\nover time, reduce resource gaps. Deflation has been averted. And as the economy continues to improve, and when we see rising\ninflation pressures, Fed policy will respond aggressively. Having said this, the main threat to these outcomes would be if clear\ndanger signals were ignored or if central bank independence were compromised.\nAs always, my remarks today reflect my own views and do not reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the views of the Federal Reserve System.\nTwo articles of faith\n\nIt is natural to start by considering the factors that affect inflation. What do economists say? Well, macroeconomists are a\ncontentious bunch. The most accomplished scholars in this field share two overpowering attributes. First, they are highly\nintelligent; and, second, when the subject is monetary policy and inflation, they appear to agree on very little. Nevertheless, I\nthink that there are two strongly held articles of faith that are, in fact, shared by the vast majority of macroeconomists.\n\n\fFirst, large, sustained and explosive growth in money is associated with high and variable rates of inflation. The logic and\nevidence are overwhelming. Economies that are running the printing presses on overdrive, usually to finance unsustainable\nfiscal deficits, generate great instability in prices and high inflation. We saw this in post-WW1 hyperinflations in Germany and\nAustria, and, more recently, in high-inflation episodes in Portugal, Italy, and Argentina. In addition, numerous studies have\ndocumented that when sustained over long periods of time, even moderately high rates of money growth are often associated\nwith significant inflation. However, it's important to note that over shorter time frames, and at lower rates of money growth,\nother factors can intervene to significantly weaken the strong positive relationship between money and prices that we see in the\nhigh inflation examples and in long run studies.5\nThe second article of faith is that high unemployment rates and slack capacity utilization—which we refer to as resource gaps—\nare often associated with falling inflation. A prime example of this is the 1981-82 recession, when unemployment rose to\nnearly 11 percent as the Volcker-led Fed broke the Great Inflation. But, similar to money growth, the evidence regarding the\ninfluence of resource gaps on inflation is strongest when considering extreme economic conditions—when there is either a\nlarge degree of slack or, on the flip side, an excessive strain on productive capacity.\nClearly, these two articles of faith can help frame the current discussion of inflation risks. On the one hand, the explosion of\nthe Federal Reserve balance sheet has led to an enormous increase in bank reserves and the monetary base. Left unchecked,\nthese monetary facts seem to scream \"inflation risks.\" On the other hand, the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is currently only 65 percent, which is the lowest level since this statistic started to be\ncomputed in 1948.6 These resource gaps suggest that disinflationary winds are blowing with gale-force effect.\nIn trying to assess inflation risks from monetary conditions and resource slack, we must remember that these factors are strong\npredictors only in relatively extreme cases. So it is the fact that we currently find ourselves in a situation with competing\nextreme cases—both large resource gaps and big expansions in the monetary base—that leads to today's Great Inflation 2.0\ndebate.\nIn a few minutes I'll return to how I see this conflict turning out. But these two articles of faith provide only a partial\nunderstanding of the factors that determine inflation during more usual times. So it is useful to first describe a relatively\nmainstream view on how inflationary pressures emerge under more typical circumstances.\nFirst-order forces of inflation determination\n\nAlthough inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, many factors come in to play when thinking about its evolution over\nthe medium term. The most important ones are: changes in resource costs, wage and price setting behaviors, and inflation\nexpectations.7 As we'll see, these forces are related to both articles of faith that I just discussed. However, there are\ndisagreements over how much weight to place on each factor, and also how to interpret the fundamentals underlying each of\nthem.\nLet me begin with resource costs. When firms set prices for the products they sell, they pass along current and expected future\nchanges in input costs, including labor costs. As a result, market prices and inflation move in the same direction as these\nresource costs. Resource costs, in turn, move with changes in demand and supply. And everything else equal, expansionary\nmonetary policy will increase demand.\nIt's natural to use movements in measures of aggregate resource utilization, such as unemployment and capacity utilization, to\ncapture changes in the supply-demand balance. In this way, resource costs are linked to resource gaps, which was the focus of\nour second \"article of faith\" about inflation determination. Unfortunately, for a host of theoretical and statistical reasons, these\nmeasures of resource utilization are imperfect proxies for supply and demand pressures, and as such, have an uncertain\nrelationship with price determination. As a result, economists will disagree on the importance of these measures for inflation\ndetermination at a given point in time. I will return to these uncertainties in a few minutes.\nAnother factor affecting inflation is inertia in wage and price setting behavior. Businesses, workers, and households typically\nmake changes to their wages and prices in an orderly fashion. For example, firms tend to stick to their pricing plans, and\nworkers' wages are typically revisited only on an annual basis. This sort of pricing behavior makes inflation inertial. However,\nthese behavioral regularities are not always well understood and we don't really know whether this sort of inertia will continue\nto characterize inflation in all future economic conditions.\nIn addition to direct cost pressures, price setting is influenced by expectations of future underlying inflation. Many things can\ninfluence peoples' expectations about the future path of inflation—it is a veritable kitchen sink. In addition to the resource costs\nI just talked about, other important influences are: changes in money growth, fiscal factors, and central bank credibility and\nindependence. Higher money growth today may lead people to conclude that inflation will increase in the future.\nUnchecked fiscal imbalances can also lead to higher expected inflation if the public believes that at least some of the fiscal\ndeficit will be paid off by printing money. And inflation expectations can increase if everyone believes that a central bank will\nrefrain from increasing policy rates for political reasons, even in the face of inflationary pressures.\n\n\fExpectations are clearly a powerful determinant of inflation, but they are inherently unobservable. Expectations reflect a\nconfluence of both objective market data and subjective beliefs of market participants. Similar to other important economic\nforces—like the output gap—the lack of observability and difficulty in measuring inflation expectations represent a powerful\nchallenge for monetary policymakers. Here is how I approach the issue. Initially, we can attempt to directly assess each\nimportant force for future inflationary pressures. This approach could construct a risk assessment for inflation pressure\nindicators and would include all of the factors cited above, at a minimum, along with an assessment (or weighting) of their\nimportance.8 Although there will be disagreements, I find this constructive approach facilitates rigorous and robust debate.\nAn alternative approach is to be agnostic about the factors that influence how inflation expectations are formed. Instead, we\nwould simply try to infer expectations from surveys and financial market data. Although this is intriguing, there are limitations\nin using this approach to the exclusion of more direct measures of inflationary forces. In particular, if monetary policy is so\nfully credible that everyone believes inflation will not deviate from its goal, inflation expectations will not respond to changes\nin the economic environment. For example, many believe that the European Central Bank's commitment to price stability over\nthe medium term is so strong that measures of euro-zone inflation expectations rarely move. But this sort of stability in\nexpected inflation does not mean that the central bank can relax its vigilance against inflationary forces. On the contrary, this\nstability is a consequence of that very vigilance. We cannot rely solely on direct measures of expected inflation without some\nsort of risk assessment that monitors indicators of inflation pressures. Fortunately, these two approaches for assessing inflation\nexpectations are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are complementary.\nOne of the big questions, however, is to ask what the historical record says about the importance of these different factors. So\nnow would be a good time to turn to a couple of quite salient historical examples.\nThe Great Inflation 1.0: 1965-82\n\nThe Great Inflation in the U.S. from 1965 to 1982 provides a good example of how a long, sustained increase in money\ngrowth tends to increase both contemporaneous inflation and expectations of future inflation. Over this period the price level\nmore than tripled, with the inflation rate peaking at over 11 percent in 1980. This rise in the price level was accompanied by\nstrong growth in both narrow and broad monetary aggregates. The monetary base, like the price level, more than tripled over\nthis period, with a growth rate peaking at nearly 10 percent.9 M2, which is a broader measure of transaction money, more\nthan quadrupled during this period, and its growth rate topped 11 percent.10 It is important to note that this broader measure\nof money, M2, largely consists of the liabilities of the private banking sector, so an expansion of broad money can be triggered\nby an increase in base money only if there's an associated growth in bank credit provision. Increased bank lending was a key\nfactor in broad money growth and the Great Inflation.\nTo see how this works, note that an expansion of base money implies an increase in both a bank's deposit liabilities and—at\nleast for the moment—its excess reserves at the central bank. Banks may choose to put these excess reserves to work by making\nloans, which will further increase the aggregate balance sheet of the commercial banking sector through the standard money\nmultiplier story. This increase in broad money, in turn, can increase inflation.\nDuring normal times, an increase in the monetary base results in an increase in broad money because banks generally lend out\nalmost all of their excess reserves. But if, for some reason they choose not to do so, then broad money will not increase as fast\nas the monetary base, and the likelihood of an increase in inflation is greatly diminished. An example of this occurred during\nthe early part of the Great Depression, when base money grew significantly but the broad money stock actually fell by a\nthird.11 We also find a disconnect today between the monetary base and broad money. Over the past year, the monetary base\nhas nearly doubled as the Fed has rapidly expanded its balance sheet. But, given the sluggish growth in bank credit, broader\nmoney has risen much less—by only around 8 percent. So, we'll need to see much more expansive bank lending if the\nmonetary base expansion is to trigger an inflation response. And we have yet to see this happen in the current economic\ndownturn.\n1979 to 1982 provides a different example of the tenuous link between money and inflation. Between 1980 and 1982 the\ninflation rate declined from its peak at 11.6 percent to 4.8 percent.12 Yet this disinflation was accompanied by an increase in\nbroad money growth, with M2 growth rising from 7.8 to 8.8 percent.13 It is noteworthy that a decline in money growth was\nnot essential for reducing inflation. The explanation is that this was a period of restrictive credit, with real interest rates\nsoaring to over 10 percent. Partly as a result of this tight credit environment, economic activity weakened considerably,\ngenerating substantial resource gaps. Restrictive credit conditions and resource gaps dominated the influence of relatively high\nrates of money growth. This episode constitutes a caveat for the monetary explanation of inflation pressures: you need to\nconsider both demand and supply pressures for money—you can't ignore the prices of liquidity and credit. Indeed, empirical\nresearch has found that outside of extreme cases money growth generally does not have much predictive power for inflation\nover the short and medium runs.14\n\nMeasures of resource slack may be misleading\n\nHistory also cautions us about relying purely on resource slack as the sole guide to inflation pressures. For example, although\nhigh rates of unemployment are typically viewed as disinflationary, the stagflation of the 1970s serves as a counterexample. A\nproblem here is that measures of resource slack can be misleading. One popular measure of resource slack is the output gap,\nwhich is the difference between actual and potential output. Here, potential output is defined as the maximum level of output\n\n\fthat can be produced without generating inflationary resource cost pressures. The problem is that potential output changes\nover time. Furthermore, it is not directly observable and must be estimated. If our estimate for potential output is off, then so\nis our measure of the output gap. This mismeasurement could confound policy. Athanasios Orphanides argues that something\nof the sort happened in the 1970s.15\nAccording to his story, economic weakness was interpreted by the Fed as evidence of a substantial output gap. This apparent\ngap prompted the Fed to expand monetary policy in an effort to attain maximum sustainable growth. But this period of\neconomic weakness coincided with a major structural slowdown in productivity growth and rising structural unemployment.\nSo the sluggish economy represented not so much an output gap as a slowdown in the growth rate of potential output. In\neffect, the resource and output gaps were overestimated, leading to an overly accommodative monetary policy.\nIs this sort of dynamic likely to be a factor in the current situation? Although some of these forces may be present, I am\nskeptical of their quantitative significance. Recent studies done at the Chicago and San Francisco Feds find little evidence that\nsectoral reallocation or other factors are increasing the unemployment rate or reducing measured output gaps on a very large\nscale.16 So I believe that resource gaps remain substantial today. That's a significant mitigating factor against inflation pressures.\nFiscal deficits and weak central banks\n\nBefore concluding, let me turn to the relationship between central bank independence, fiscal policy, and inflation outcomes.\nIndependence of the central bank is always important. Periodically, the central bank at times must take tough actions that are\nneeded for future and medium-term prosperity, even though these actions are painful in the immediate short-term. The classic\nexample is the need to increase policy rates on early signs that inflation could be rising substantially even though the real\neconomy remains weak. In this situation, there may be pressure for the central bank to inappropriately re-weight its dual\nmandate objectives and postpone the monetary tightening until matters in the real economy improve further. A central bank\nthat lacks independence and therefore opts to postpone tightening policy has effectively abandoned its low inflation goal. As a\nresult, both expected and actual inflation can increase.\nFiscal pressures can also pose problems for central bank independence if large deficits are expected into the foreseeable future.\nEven if the central bank pursues a tight monetary policy, both current and expected future inflation can still increase if the\npublic believes that the central bank will be forced to monetize the government debt sometime in the future. Tom Sargent and\nNeal Wallace coined the term \"Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic\" for this process.17 In principle, very large debt levels could\ncompromise the independence of even the strongest central bank if the choice is between monetizing the debt or, inducing a\ncostly monetary contraction.\nHere again, the historical link between fiscal pressures and very high inflation is clear. As I noted earlier, the major hyperinflations in Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland during the inter-war years, and more recent high-inflation episodes in\nArgentina, Portugal and Italy, all involved to varying degrees large structural fiscal imbalances combined with some lack of\ncentral bank independence. The key take-away is that rising, unsustainable fiscal deficits can derail the low inflation plans of a\nweak central bank, and can test the souls of the strongest central bankers. Unpleasant monetarist arithmetic argues that fiscal\ndiscipline is a necessary component for favorable inflation outcomes. There is no reason to think that this conclusion does not\napply to the U.S. While significant fiscal stimulus was an appropriate response to a very large recession, it is essential that the\nnation show that it has a plan for restoring long-run fiscal balance.\n\nPolicy conclusions\n\nI started today by describing two extreme views for the future of inflation. One view, motivated by the expanding Fed balance\nsheet, has inflation greatly increasing in the future, while the other view, motivated by a sluggish economy and large resource\ngaps, has strong disinflationary forces. My view is that large resource gaps have been met by a large growth in reserves: In an\neffort to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, the Fed acted quickly and decisively over the past year to provide liquidity\nto markets and to prevent systemically important institutions from failing. These are things that the 1930s Fed did not do. It is\nprecisely these actions that have greatly expanded our balance sheet. So, the co-existence of the motivating observations for the\ntwo extreme inflation views is not very surprising.\nNow for the hard part: Just as the Fed acted responsibly to prevent a potential deflation, it will do so to prevent a future\nincrease in inflation above our price stability objective. Unfortunately, this sounds too much like, \"just trust us to do the right\nthing.\" This is uncomfortable for everyone, but it is a natural dilemma at this point in the economic cycle when it is yet too\nsoon to actually begin removing policy accommodation.\nI am confident that the Federal Reserve will achieve the price stability component of our mandate. Our response will embody\nthree principles; prepare, monitor, and act. Chairman Bernanke recently testified on the tremendous preparations that the\nFOMC is undertaking in order to be sure our balance sheet can be reduced and that appropriately restrictive monetary policies\ncan be implemented when necessary. And the FOMC is monitoring economic and inflation conditions for the signs that\nadjustments in policy are needed. I hope my comments on inflation expectations and direct assessments of inflationary\npressures have been helpful in this regard. Finally, the Fed will act in a timely and appropriate manner to achieve our dual\nmandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\n\fNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer\nKrane, Hesna Genay and David Marshall and Ed Nosal.\n1\n\nSee Krugman (2008, 2009) and Meltzer (2009).\n\n2\n\nAccording to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), the implicit price deflator level fell by about 25 percent between 1929 and\n1933.\n3\n\nThe PCE (personal consumption expenditures) chain price index increased 1.7 percent between December 1964 and\nDecember 1965 and 10.5 percent between December 1979 and December 1980.\n4\n\nYear-over-year PCE inflation did not consistently fall below 2 percent until May 1997. It remained below 2 percent until\nDecember 1999.\n5\n\nSee, McCandless and Weber (1995), Fischer et al (2002), and Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n6\n\nManufacturing capacity utilization was 65.4 percent in July 2009, which is the lowest reading since January 1967 when the\nNAICS-based capacity utilization series start. (NAICS is North American Industry Classification System.) Before 1967, capacity\nutilization is available on an SIC (Standard Industry Classification) basis; at no time between then and its first reading in\nJanuary 1948 does this measure fall below 70 percent.\n7\n\nThese ideas are embodied in macroeconomic analyses from Friedman (1968) and Lucas (1972) to current generations of\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium models like Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).\n8\n\nThese weights could be informed by the performance of formal statistical inflation forecasting models that use these\nindicators.\n9\n\nBetween 1971 and 1980, the monetary base grew, on average, about 8 percent per year.\n\n10\n\nGrowth in seasonally adjusted M0 from Jan 1965-Dec. 1982 = 238.67 percent; growth in SA M1 over the same period =\n195.46 percent; growth in SA M2 over the same period = 346.62 percent.\n11\n\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 299, also Table B-3.\n\n12\n\nThese are December-to-December changes in the PCE chain price index.\n\n13\n\nYear-over-year growth in M2 was 8.0 percent in October 1979 and 8.8 percent in October 1982.\n\n14\n\nSee Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n15\n\nSee Orphanides and van Norden (2002) and Orphanides (2004).\n\n16\n\nSee Valletta and Cleary (2008), Fernald and Matoba (2009), and Rissman (2009).

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 12/01/09\n\nNontraditional Monetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\nChamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County\nSouth Bend, IN\nIntroduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you, Mark [(Dobson), president and CEO of the Chamber] for that introduction. And thanks to the\nChamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County for inviting me this afternoon to share my thoughts on nontraditional monetary\npolicies and the economic outlook.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or\nsurpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. Much like the rest of Indiana and surrounding states, the South\nBend—Mishawaka area has been hit hard by the national recession.\nWhile the area's outsized education and health services sectors have buffered overall job loss to some extent, this buffer has\nbeen undone by the region's outsized concentration in manufacturing and distribution.\nThese exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for both the economy and policymakers. For us at the Fed, the\nresponse has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ significantly from the standard\npolicies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these exceptional circumstances. As such,\nthey will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is more clearly headed toward\nsustainable growth and price stability. Today I would like to discuss the precepts that underlie these nontraditional policies,\nprovide my outlook for the economy, and conclude with thoughts on some of the tactical issues we must consider when\nunwinding the programs. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\n\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds\ntarget rate, which is the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be reduced\nbelow zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the\nfunctioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align riskadjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across\nthe entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that\narbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not\naffect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional monetary policies. These can be broadly categorized in three\ngroups. The first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely, discount window\nlending through which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral.\nSince August 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including\nreducing the discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new\nlending facilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for\nfinancial participants that are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and Treasury securities. This can be seen as\nan extension of traditional open-market operations. The Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly different scale.\nTaken as a whole, our nontraditional monetary policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\"\n(TSLF, PDCF, etc.). But there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first\nis insurance: Don't put all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the\nthird is size: In an environment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of\nthese precepts before addressing some tactical issues we must consider in unwinding the programs and returning to more\ntraditional policies.\n\nInsurance\n\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks and related uncertainties that emerged in the past\ntwo years and the speed at which they transpired. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial\nsystem, stable growth, and price stability. We saw failures in parts of the financial system, but did not know how serious they\n\n\fwere and how they would affect the rest of the economy. We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, but\nwere uncertain how deep the downturn would be. Finally, price levels declined for the first time in decades, but we did not\nknow if we would slide into an extended period of deflation.\nThe diagnosis of our problems was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that\nwe considered brought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies\nand were unsure how effective they would be and which could be implemented in a timely fashion given the practical and legal\nconstraints we were facing.\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on\nany single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope\nthat we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\nInnovation\n\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss\none program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change.\nLet's look at the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nAfter the failure of Lehman Brothers, the markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) effectively shut down in October 2008. The\nABS markets play a vital role in providing funds that support loans to consumers and small businesses. In response the Fed\nannounced the formation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF is aimed at revitalizing the ABS\nmarkets by providing loans to investors to finance their purchases of certain highly rated asset-backed securities, with the\nsecurities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nThe first markets targeted by the facility were relatively simple assets—auto, student, credit card, and Small Business\nAdministration (SBA) loans. These securities were familiar to market participants, and their pricing was relatively\nstraightforward. Since then we have moved on to more complex and long-lived instruments, including legacy assets.\nTALF has generated two opposite concerns: One is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to fund large\nvolumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck a good\nbalance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent credit\nquality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not\nintended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former\nlevel of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal is to boost private sector credit flows in support of\nthe economy by mitigating some of the stresses in these markets. In turn, this should allow the markets to reach their\nappropriate size in a less disruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on assetbacked securities have come down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some\ninstitutional investors are re-entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have\nlabeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in\nthe federal funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nNotably, in March we announced a considerable increase in our large-scale asset purchase program, in which we buy GSE\nagency debt and MBS and long-term Treasury notes. We made this aggressive move to substantially increase monetary\naccommodation in light of the considerable risks that the real economy faced at that time. As a consequence, however, there\nwas another large increase in the size of our balance sheet, and it is now well above what it has typically been.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper\ndesign required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take\ntime to affect economic activity. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest\nactions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as\ninadequate.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nTurning now to the economic outlook, the U.S. economy has contracted sharply since the middle of last year, with real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) having dropped at an average annual rate of about 4.1 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the\nfirst quarter of this year. Employment has fallen by more than 5-1/2 million since then. The downturn in activity has been\nwidespread across the economy, with significant declines in consumer spending, residential investment, and business\ninvestment.\nHowever, there have been some favorable developments of late, and the possibility that the economy is closer to a turning point\nis stronger now than just three months ago. Although the data have been uneven, our reading of the recent indicators is that\nthe pace of contraction is slowing and that activity is bottoming out. We expect modest increases in output in the second half\nof this year followed by somewhat stronger growth in 2010.\n\n\fSo what are these signs of improvement that underlie this forecast? First, financial market conditions have improved, with\ncredit spreads and other measures of market stress much lower than they were in late 2008 and early 2009.\nConsumer spending, which had dropped sharply since the second half of last year, has been roughly flat so far in 2009.\nHousing markets, after more than three years of decline, have also shown some signs of stabilizing. Sales of both new and\nexisting homes have appeared to flatten out in recent months, though both remain at very low levels. Meanwhile, homebuilders\nhave reduced their backlog of unsold new homes—a precondition for any recovery in homebuilding. But the backlog of unsold\nexisting homes remains high, and delinquency and foreclosure rates continue to be a substantial risk to the housing market\nrecovery.\nLabor markets remain weak, but there has been a (somewhat uneven) decline in the pace of job losses. The May and June\naverage of monthly declines in employment was about half the rate of contraction as the beginning of this year, and newly filed\njobless claims seem to have peaked in late March. However, firms are still reluctant to hire, and the unemployment rate reached\n9-1/2 percent in June and will likely further increase through the remainder of the year before it flattens out in 2010.\nThe industrial side of the economy has been especially hard hit this year, but there are signs that the worst of the decline in the\nsector is in the past. Business fixed investment remains weak, but the decline is getting shallower. Steep inventory liquidations\nmade significant negative contributions to output growth in late 2008 and early 2009. But this means that inventories are in\nbetter alignment with sales, so we expect to see less dramatic liquidation in the months ahead. In turn, the smaller declines\ntranslate into a net positive for GDP growth. Finally, in the coming months, the fiscal stimulus will continue to have positive\ninfluences on the economy.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the\nremarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast\nfor 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two\nconflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of\ncapacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed,\nsome statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent\nwe might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely, consumers' and businesses' expectations of\nfuture inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise\nconsidering that the severity of the downturn might have worked to lower them. And as economic conditions improve,\nconsumers and businesses might expect upward pressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation\nexpectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many economic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, core inflation is near 2 percent, a level I generally find acceptable. In the near term, I think the downward forces on\ninflation will be greater than the upward forces, and we could see some declines in core inflation. But over the medium term I\nsee the risks to the inflation forecast as being more balanced.\nBack to normal\n\nOver time, as the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the challenge for the Fed will be\nthe unwinding of our nontraditional programs. As this happens, the Fed will progressively return to its traditional policies—\nthat is, setting the federal funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short-term loans, so as these programs come to\nan end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to\nbe unattractive in normal times. As they cease to be useful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being\nused less, and we should see that trend continue as conditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to\nmanage it actively so that monetary policy can be more easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out\nas we were on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our\nassets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse\nrepurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on\nreserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could\nrequire sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem\nwith our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the federal funds rate near the target.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance\nsheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast and remains large. There are historical\nprecedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit expansion and to be subsequently\nassociated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: Inflationary pressures will not arise without\nbroader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present.\n\n\fNevertheless, these precedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the\ngrowth in our balance sheet.\nRight now, in the absence of unexpected shocks and changes, I don't foresee the need for any major changes to the policy\nparameters of the programs, and I view us in a wait and see mode.\nConclusion\n\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from\ntraditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety\nof risks we have faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends\nremain unchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable\ngrowth, and price stability. As economic conditions continue to improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction\nin our balance sheet, these ends remain uppermost in our minds.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

The European Economics and Financial Center (EEFC) has a history of engaging practitioners and theorists in the\nhealthy exchange of ideas, promoting closer links between the two groups. Indeed, the type of research and advisory work\nperformed by the EEFC is even more important when policy is addressing interconnected global issues.\nAs we all are too well aware, these are turbulent times in financial markets. We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis\nsince the 1930s. Numerous important financial institutions have either disappeared or survived only with substantial\ngovernment assistance. Even among those escaping such fates, many have seen their balance sheets significantly damaged by\npoor risk management over the last decade. As these institutions have deleveraged and recapitalized, there have been substantial\ndisruptions in credit flows, and economic activity around the world has suffered significantly.\nThis crisis has revealed some major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework. If we truly hope to be able to say \"never\nagain,\" we need to act aggressively to address these weaknesses. All around the world, there is a healthy debate currently under\nway over how best to do this. I believe this debate is valuable. As we adopt new public policies in response to the crisis, we\nneed to be confident in our evaluations of the lessons we've learned and understand how regulatory changes will affect the\nefficiency of the financial services sector going forward. Here in the UK, you have responded to the turmoil with the passage of\nthe Banking Act of 2009. In the U.S., the Obama administration has just unveiled a plan for financial regulatory reform and\nsent it to Congress for review. 1\nAll the major proposals seek to impose greater discipline on the industry. Such discipline, both from the market and from\nregulators, should lead to changes in behavior that reduce the likelihood that firms will find themselves on the brink of failure.\nIn practice this is likely to mean new requirements on capital structure, enhanced liquidity management, and perhaps some\nrestrictions on activities. But, no matter how well crafted such policies are, we also have to recognize the risk that financial\ninstitutions still may fail. Thus, there appears to be broad agreement on the need for reforms in how we deal with the possible\nfailure of systemically important financial institutions—what people often call the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. That is my\ntopic for this evening.\nFor good reason, the development of an orderly process for resolving distressed institutions is a common element of both your\nBanking Act and the Obama administration's new proposal. I'll argue that having such a mechanism is important not just\nbecause some institutions will inevitably fail and thus need resolution, but because without it, market discipline is significantly\ncompromised. For market discipline to be effective, failure has to be a real possibility for all institutions. Meltzer once said:\n\"Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.\" And given the events of the last two years, market participants would be\njustified in at least having some doubts about whether certain firms would be allowed to fail in future crises. Thus, in order to\ncreate effective market discipline, we need a regime shift that removes such doubt.\nAs I'll discuss, TBTF is a very important, but difficult problem. And one for which important details all too often get\noverlooked or ignored. However, it is the details that will determine the success of policy in this area. Additionally, there is\nprobably no single adjustment that would resolve the problems associated with TBTF.\nRather, it will likely take a multifaceted solution. Tonight, I want to give you my take on some issues related to too-big-to-fail,\nas well as stress the importance of some of the details and the reasons for a multifaceted approach to the problem. I should\nnote that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat is the too-big-to-fail problem?\n\nThe TBTF problem is the perception—and perhaps the reality—that the failure of some institutions would have such large\nspillovers to other parts of the financial system, and such significant repercussions for the economy, that regulators would need\nto step in to prevent failure. These interventions could insulate creditors, counterparties, and perhaps even shareholders from\nlosses. Left unchecked, this introduces a classic moral hazard problem: Financial institutions will have incentives to grow too\nlarge, to take on too much risk, and to be too slow to recapitalize when they encounter difficulties.\n\n\fIn the U.S., the TBTF problem first came to prominence with the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois Bank—a bank located\ndirectly across the street from the Chicago Fed. In the resolution process, equity holders were wiped out, but there were\nconcerns about the potential spillovers if debt holders were required to take losses. Thus, Continental was deemed TBTF and\ndebt holders were rescued.2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took temporary ownership of the bank and did\nnot relinquish it until later in the decade.\nAfter the failure of Continental and the heavy losses associated with the thrift industry in the late 1980s, the U.S. Congress was\nvery critical of bank supervisory forbearance. It enacted legislation that dictated \"prompt corrective action,\" or PCA. When a\ntroubled bank's capital falls below successive capital thresholds, it must raise additional capital, restrict activities, restrict\ninterest payments and asset growth, cease payment of dividends, and limit senior executive compensation.3 With the same\nlegislation, an explicit policy on TBTF was codified in the systemic risk exception to the 1990 Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The goal was to explicitly minimize the use of TBTF by making the process very\npublic and requiring sign-off by leading regulators and senior officials, including the U.S. President.\nWhile PCA worked fairly well in the recent financial crisis, some large commercial banks failed and were liquidated. Others\nwere purchased, some with support from regulatory authorities and some without support. There were, however, some\nperceived inconsistencies and concerns about ad hoc procedures in certain situations. Two notable cases were the sale of\nWachovia Corporation—which, by the way, was the first time the systemic risk exception to FDICIA was ever deployed—and\nwhen the FDIC took over management of the day-to-day operations of IndyMac Federal Bank after it was unable to find a\nbuyer.\nThe recent financial crisis also revealed new dimensions of the TBTF problem. The systemic risk exception applies only to\ncommercial banks. But recently there have been significant issues regarding the systemic implications from the failure of large\nnonbank financial firms. Significant problems in the U.S. have occurred surrounding investment banks, and similar concerns\nare being expressed about insurance companies and hedge funds. There are also issues regarding the relationships between\nbanks and their parent holding companies. For example, significant losses have been imposed on stakeholders of bank holding\ncompanies—although the stakeholders were not always clear on whether they owned claims on the bank or on the holding\ncompany. More generally, the complicated interconnections between the bank and its holding company have made the\nresolution of the bank more difficult and costly.4\nThese nonbank financial institutions are organizations for which no formal systemic risk exception exists; their resolution is\nhandled through standard bankruptcy proceedings.5 Such proceedings do not bring any extra resources to bear to deal with\npotential spillover effects to other market participants and the real economy. Although the societal costs from such spillovers\nare difficult to quantify, at times they could be substantial. Concerns about the disruptive aspects of putting a systemically\nimportant nonbank through the bankruptcy process has made regulators and others rethink the regulatory infrastructure\ncovering these institutions in a number of ways.\nCan regulators \"just say no\"?\n\nLet's discuss some of the means people have suggested to address TBTF problems. One view is rather simple: Let the market\nwork. This view holds that TBTF problems arise only because regulators lack sufficient backbone to let large firms fail. If the\nauthorities would just commit to not undertaking bailouts and let existing financial and bankruptcy laws operate, the resolution\nprocess would proceed with losses being allocated according to predetermined priorities. There may be temporary market\ndisruptions, but the claim is that the disruptions will be manageable.\nAdvocates of such a hands-off policy argue that the main problems resulting from TBTF are moral hazard and the long-run\ndistortions and inefficiencies associated with it. In this view, problems arise when authorities deviate from a policy of\nnonintervention, sending mixed signals and confusing markets. This weakens the incentives of firms and their creditors to\nexercise prudent judgment. If there were no expectation of a government intervention, financial institutions would be\ncompelled to choose a capital structure to withstand market forces, prudently manage risk, and, as a result, lower the\nprobability of a large bank failure.\nThe logic of market discipline is certainly compelling. Given adequate transparency, the market has substantial potential to\nmonitor firm behavior, perhaps more closely than a small number of regulators. And in my view, enhanced market discipline is\nalmost certainly an important part of the solution to our regulatory problems. But the shift to a policy of increased reliance on\nmarket discipline is not a simple process. Regulators cannot simply decide to \"just say no\" going forward. Their commitment to\navoid intervention must be credible, and must be perceived to be credible by the markets. Credibility can take years to develop\nand can be destroyed quickly by just one instance of forbearance or the provision of exceptional assistance.\nPlus there is another issue: It is not obvious that the optimal choice in dealing with the potential failure of a systematically\nimportant financial institution is always to \"just say no.\" Let's think about the underlying the decision to let such an institution\nfail or to provide it with exceptional support.\nThe costs of providing exceptional support are increased future risk-taking by other large or highly interconnected (TBTF)\ninstitutions without inducing corresponding increases in risk management. Such increased risk-taking would lead to distortions\nin both the levels and allocation of credit, possibly inducing excessive investment in higher-risk projects or sectors of the\n\n\feconomy. This would adversely affect real macroeconomic performance.\nAlternatively, the costs of letting a large institution fail in a disorderly way are the macroeconomic consequences of resulting\ndisruptions in financial markets. Creditworthy households and businesses may not be able to fund their ongoing activities.\nFurthermore, investment in plant and equipment would be distorted, which could also have long-run implications resulting\nfrom a suboptimal capital stock.\nThe cold calculus of this decision would involve comparing the two costs. This is very difficult to do and intelligent individuals\ncan reasonably disagree on the two magnitudes. Proponents of the \"just say no\" policy will argue that in the moment of crisis,\nregulators overestimate the cost from current market distortions and discount the future benefits from imposing market\ndiscipline. That is human nature. As a result, regulators may occasionally err on the side of providing exceptional assistance.6\nPerhaps. However, it is not at all clear that this has been the case in recent situations.\nConsider one of the more prominent episodes during the course of the current crisis. In March of last year, the Federal\nReserve provided extraordinary assistance to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. Proponents of the \"just say\nno\" position argue that this was a mistake.7 Bear should have been allowed to fail, they argue, with debt holders and\ncounterparties taking appropriate losses. This, in their view, would have sent a clear message that government assistance would\nnot be forthcoming in the future. They claim the consequences for the economy would have been relatively modest and worth\nthe long-term benefits. I disagree.\nLet's think about the counterfactual question of what would have happened if we had simply let Bear fail at the outset of the\ncrisis. While it is impossible to know for sure how events would have turned out, I think that it is quite likely that we would\nhave seen markets seize up sooner than they actually did. My thinking is influenced by the events following the failure of\nLehman Brothers, when investors became extraordinarily risk averse and withdrew liquidity funding. I think a Bear Stearns\nfailure would have almost surely led to similar risk aversion. For instance, Bear also was prominent in the tri-party repo\nmarket, which serves as an important source of short-term funding for large financial institutions. Upon failure, Bear's\ncounterparties would have received collateral, which they either could not or would not want to hold. This could have lead to a\ndumping of certain asset classes on the market at fire-sale prices and, most likely a general aversion to counterparty risk.\nSimilarly, just like the Reserve Fund held too much of Lehman Brothers' commercial paper when it failed, other mutual funds\nwere likely overexposed to the paper of Bear Stearns. Thus, a Bear failure might also have generated at the time a run on\nmoney market mutual funds and commercial paper markets.\nFurthermore, the problems in financial markets were already largely in place by the spring of 2008. Losses related to mortgage\nportfolios were going to be incurred by someone. The credit default swap (CDS) exposure of AIG (American International\nGroup Inc.) had been put in place years before and losses from that exposure were not a result of poor risk management\nfollowing the demise of Bear Stearns, on March 17. In retrospect, given the massive mortgage-related losses, the downgrade of\nAIG was likely inevitable based on its investment strategy. The calls for additional CDS collateral were going to be triggered\nregardless of the decisions on Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, resulting in the type of liquidity crisis that necessitated loans\nfrom the central bank.\nIn my view, the conclusion to be drawn from this hypothetical is that not providing exceptional assistance to Bear would have\nresulted in financial distress and a stock market implosion in March of last year rather than in September. While one cannot\nsay for sure whether the situation would have been worse, I personally doubt it would have been better. Without assistance, the\npotential for even more widespread disruption seems more plausible to me. A fundamental observation is that large mortgage\nlosses had to be allocated among leveraged investors. This set in motion a scramble to avoid taking losses.\nNevertheless, the argument can be made that by letting Bear Stearns enter bankruptcy during a period of financial distress,\nfinancial institutions would have realized that they would be subject to market discipline in the future, which would induce\nmore prudent behavior. However, I think it is more likely that we would have seen exactly the opposite reaction. Given the\nlikely severe fallout, regulators would have been sharply criticized. This could have generated a perception that regulators\nwould never again allow such a calamity to occur. Thus the commitment to \"just say no\" would no longer be credible. The\nmarket would perceive the potential for using TBTF to actually be greater than before, not less. Indeed, this is the lesson that\nsome draw from the failure of Lehman Brothers and the resulting financial upheaval.\nThese concerns about the role of market discipline and its limitations are strongest during times of crisis. The decisions\nregarding the failure of a single large bank during a more tranquil time could be very different. But the cost–benefit calculus\ncould also be made significantly different, even during times of crisis, if a better infrastructure was in place to resolve problem\ninstitutions in a less disruptive manner. We would all prefer such a tilting away from forbearance and public assistance.\nHowever, to assume you could \"just say no\" in the environment of March 2008 with the existing infrastructure is somewhat\nidealistic in my view and overlooks a number of details involved with the resolution process.\nTo position ourselves to better utilize market discipline, we need a better resolution process that will address the new\ndimensions of the TBTF problem. I believe an effective resolution process requires two elements:\n\n\f1. An entity must be responsible for overseeing systemically important financial institutions (micro-prudential regulation). In\norder to reduce the chances that the systemically important institutions get into financial difficulties, that entity would need the\npower to gather necessary data and to restrict the behavior of these institutions. The entity would also need to evaluate the\ninterconnectedness of institutions and to address potential problems for markets as a result of spillover effects (macroprudential regulation).\n2. There should be a well-defined resolution process that limits market disruption and avoids the problems associated with a\nfinancial institution going through the standard bankruptcy process. Regulators have been criticized too often for addressing\neach failure in an ad hoc manner, as if there were no lessons from history. The need for an advance plan is imperative.8\nThe Obama administration's reform plan provides useful proposals for these concerns. Yet even under the best plan that meets\nthese elements, getting the details right is crucial. Who will decide when the resolution process begins? What should the trigger\nbe? Should prompt corrective action begin at higher levels of capitalization than the current triggers for banks? Is temporary\nnationalization a necessary component? Will allowing for this potential lead to excessive use of this option? How will a\nmultinational presence complicate the policy alternatives and how can that best be addressed? Details matter, and by getting the\ndetails correct, we can hopefully minimize the TBTF problem going forward.\nLimiting size and complexity\n\nSome recommendations to address TBTF involve limiting the ability or incentive of financial institutions to become\nparticularly large or complex, thus lessening the odds of adverse spillovers. In other words, to keep institutions from becoming\ntoo big to fail, keep them from becoming too big, period.9 In the U.S., one could possibly achieve this by strictly enforcing\nnational deposit share limits and perhaps tightening those limits over time. One could even consider the breaking up of firms\nin a manner similar to how Standard Oil was broken up in the U.S. in the early twentieth century. But size is not the only\nfactor that would need to be considered. There would also have to be limits on \"interconnectedness\" and on product\ncomplexity. Additionally, there are probably other time-varying dimensions that may prove to be significant. The dynamic and\nevolutionary features of systemic importance will require continual monitoring.\nI'd like to make two points about these policy alternatives. First, one would assume that financial institutions increase their size,\ndevelop new financial products, and become interconnected with other firms because doing so creates real economic value. It\nmay be that this went somewhat beyond socially optimal levels in recent years. But at a basic level, growth, new products, and\nactivities that increase interconnectedness can improve welfare. Thus, one needs to be careful to not overly constrain such\nactivities.10\nA second issue involves the market response to regulatory constraints. If we constrain certain behavior, firms will likely develop\nalternative means to accomplish the same ends.11One can argue that many of the off-balance-sheet items and special-purpose\nvehicles that were created in recent years were at least in part attempts to get around regulatory constraints. This so-called\nregulatory arbitrage also likely increased the role of the shadow financial sector.12Thus, while constraints sound\nstraightforward and simple to implement, they may require significant resources to effectively enforce and may be less effective\nthan expected as firms attempt to get around them.\nWhile severe limits on the size and scope of financial institutions may be neither feasible nor desirable, if such activities result\nin risk to the financial system it may be appropriate to impose special requirements on them. Thus, an alternative proposal to\naddress TBTF is to expand the risk-based capital requirements to explicitly account for contributions to systemic risks. This\ncould involve larger weights on factors associated with systemic risk, such as institution size, off-balance-sheet activities, and\nthe degree of interconnectedness with other institutions. Adjusting capital requirements for these and other systemic factors\nwould make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society rather than just themselves. This\nidea of forcing financial institutions to account for the impact of their actions on others is also addressed in the Obama\nadministration's proposal. This approach could fit within our existing Basel capital requirements, as regulators could expand the\nrisk factors to account for systemic risk. Of course, we would still encounter regulatory avoidance. And it also could be\nparticularly difficult to decide on the variables and weights to include in the risk-based capital calculations.\nThis incorporation of systemic risk factors would require supervisors to obtain improved measures of interconnectedness and\nsystemic importance. Along these lines, the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation13has recommended the\ndevelopment of a new comprehensive database to be managed by supervisors. All larger institutions would be required to\nprovide systemic-risk-related data at regular time intervals—say, on a quarterly basis—into the central system, as would\nfinancial institutions of any size deemed to have operations that would lead to significant spillover effects. One could easily\nenvision this including a broad array of financial institutions (banks, thrifts, insurance companies, hedge funds, governmentsponsored enterprises, etc.) and possibly entities outside of the financial sector.\nThe goal is to allow regulators and, potentially, the market to better understand the fault lines in financial markets and to more\nclearly understand the impact of systemic risk. The Squam Lake Working Group stresses the need to share the information\namong regulatory agencies and to provide it to the private markets, perhaps with a lag, to enable the marketplace to detect\ntrends and tendencies that may otherwise be overlooked.14\n\n\fIn addition to modifying the risk weights, there have also been proposals to introduce countercyclical capital requirements. It is\ntypically during boom times that excessive risk taking occurs, as firms get caught up in the good times and seem to assume\nthey will continue forever. Countercyclical capital requirements would tend to lean against the wind to combat this. For\nexample, just to fix ideas for the discussion, to be considered adequately capitalized, tier 1 plus tier 2 capital requirements\ncould be changed from 8 percent across the entire business cycle to perhaps 10 percent during \"good times\" and 7 percent\nduring \"problem times.\" Time-varying requirements would serve as a governor to excessive growth and would allow for the\ngeneration of an additional capital cushion that could be utilized when the economy slows. Although this would induce credit\nrestraint if imposed in the middle of a cycle, sufficient planning and credibility would ultimately lead institutions to adopt more\nrisk-prudent capital structures.\nWhile I believe there is a place for such revisions to capital requirements, again, the details are crucial. Attempting to force\nfirms to hold capital to reflect the systemic risks they pose is easy to defend in principle, but very difficult to adequately\nimplement. Liquidity problems were a major concern during the recent crisis. How would liquidity be incorporated into\nchanges in capital requirements? Recall that the Basel capital requirements generated concerns about banks gaming\nimperfections in the relative capital requirements across asset risk categories. Imposing capital requirements on systemic-riskrelated factors and weights that vary across the business cycle would be significantly more difficult and would induce a\nresponse by the affected firms. Thus, regulators would need to anticipate and react to that response in setting policy. As such,\nproperly setting capital requirements will likely be an ongoing, iterative process.\nContingent capital and self-created bankruptcy plans\n\nThe idea of supplementing bank capital during \"good\" times has been taken further by Mark Flannery and members of the\nSquam Lake Working Group. Fundamentally, the argument is that banks need to hold more capital and they tend to resist\nholding higher levels because it is expensive. Similarly, existing shareholders are not in favor of issuing new capital because of\nthe associated dilutive effects. To address this problem, the Squam Lake Working Group proposes that systemically important\nbanks should be required to issue new \"contingent capital certificates.\" These securities would be sold as debt liabilities that\nmake standard tax-deductible interest payments. However, unlike conventional debt obligations, they would be converted into\nequity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.15 The triggering mechanism could be based on a number of\nthings including existing capital levels, equity share prices, declaration by the regulators that conditions of systemic stress exist,\nor a violation of covenants in the debt contract. Conversion would not be optional; rather it would be mandatory once\ntriggered by one of these mechanisms. If all goes well, the bonds are retired with typical cash payments to the debt holders.\nHowever, if the bank's position deteriorates, the debt converts into new equity shares, diluting the existing shares and serving\nto cushion losses. To avoid reaching this point of conversion the bank would likely be more willing to promptly issue new\nequity when difficulties are encountered. Thus, the new debt instruments could improve risk-taking incentives and provide an\nadditional capital cushion to insulate taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund from costly interventions. Another problem\nmight occur if the supply of funds to these convertible investments is small, and hence, the debt would be expensive. Well, if\nmore capital was in place, the convertible debt would be less likely to convert; hence, it would be less risky and presumably\ncheaper. For safety and soundness reasons, a better capital structure is a key objective, and these forces help to improve the\ncapital structure.\nA related alternative involves enhancing capital cushions by requiring systemically important firms to purchase contingent\ncapital in the form of capital insurance.16 The general purpose is the same as that for using contingent capital certificates—that\nis, to provide a source of additional capital during crisis periods. With this proposal it is imperative that the insurance be failproof; thus, proposals typically require that the insurance funds be placed in a segregated lock box—perhaps in Treasuries.17\nTargeted issuers of the insurance could include sovereign wealth funds or private equity. The trigger for the insurance payment\ncould be based on the condition of the individual firm or on the condition of the financial industry. Again, the purpose of the\ninsurance is to address catastrophes; thus it would be more commonly associated with deteriorating industry conditions.\nA final reform proposal requires that systemically important financial institutions help plan their own resolution process. The\nidea is to have a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan that has already considered and addressed problem resolution areas. This may sound\nsomewhat odd, but the firm itself must be in a preferred position to be aware of potential impediments to resolution.18\nSupervisors would require firms to address potential resolution problem areas, such as the transfer of the derivatives book or\nresolution of foreign subsidiaries. One can envision this plan being stress tested as part of the regular examination process.\nSuch a discussion would yield risk-management benefits for the firms and the supervisor. Requiring such a plan could also\nsomewhat constrain firms from taking on higher-risk activities during boom times and would force them to think about\ncontingent plans and develop them even when financial difficulties seem far removed. Again, the plan sets up ex ante\nprocedures to help avoid conditions that require consideration of TBTF.\nAs interesting as these new proposals are, they also have potential implementation problems. Again, details count. For\ncontingent capital there is the matter of deciding on the appropriate conversion trigger. For the \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan, there\nare potential issues of regulatory avoidance and attempting to hide relevant information. There is also the issue of deciding\nwhether the information should be made public. All these issues need to be carefully evaluated. The quality of the decisions on\nthese details will determine the effectiveness of the new program.\n\n\fClosing comments\n\nSo where do I come out on these issues? I do believe that we can do a much better job of preventing (albeit, not entirely\navoiding) crisis situations and I believe we can be better prepared to address them when they do occur. Much of the current\npolicy discussion on the need for some form of a systemic risk regulator and improved resolution process is most appropriate\nand should be thoroughly vetted. Both ideas are included in President Obama's regulatory reform proposal that was recently\nsent to Congress. Obviously, there are a number of details to be addressed, but I hope we can grasp the moment and not let the\nopportunity to implement meaningful reform pass.\nI believe that such policies aimed at influencing the ex ante behavior of the firm are likely to be effective at avoiding crisis\nsituations in the first place. The reinforcement or backup capital created through the contingent capital or catastrophe\ninsurance requirements would better enable firms to ride out the turbulent times. The countercyclical capital requirements\nand/or the self-created \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan could serve as a governor on risk-taking during boom times, again, serving to\ndecrease the potential for encountering financial crises. It could also lead to a more efficient and effective failure resolution\nprocess. I believe these proposals merit careful consideration.\nFor a number of reasons, I think it is important to create \"regime-shifting\" reforms. Here, the reform proposals could also be\nuseful in that they announce to the industry that a new regulatory environment exists. Procedures would be in place to dampen\nthe potential need for TBTF policies. There would be fewer costs involved from letting relatively complex firms be resolved\nwithout social assistance. Thus, there would be fewer incentives to protect the troubled financial firm. Realizing this, it would\nbe in the financial firm's best interest to more prudently manage risk. Less emphasis would be placed on regulatory experiences\nfrom the past. Moral hazard would be reduced.\nFinally, while I find a number of these proposals to be interesting, I don't see how any in isolation would fully address all the\nassociated problems. It seems that there is a need for a systemic regulator and a fully developed failure resolution plan for\nsystemically important firms. While these changes are necessary, additional tools are required to alter firm behavior to lower\nthe potential for encountering problems and to make the resolution go smoothly once it becomes necessary. I believe a number\nof the proposals discussed could serve that purpose, and they would be complementary instead of substitutes. They warrant\nserious consideration if we are to adequately address the issues associated with TBTF.\nNotes\n1\n\nSee The Banking Act of 2009, available online; and U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, Financial Regulatory Reform, A\nNew Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation, Washington, DC, June 17, available online.\n2\n\nWhile Continental Illinois is often associated with the first use of the TBTF policy in the U.S., many of the characteristics of\nthe resolution were not unique and had been utilized before.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 11/30/09\n\nNontraditional Monetary Policy\nExecutives' Club of Chicago\nChicago, IL\nIntroduction\n\nGood morning and thank you, Diane for that kind introduction. And thanks to Kaarina of the Executives' Club of Chicago for\ninviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on non–traditional monetary policies.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or\nsurpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. These exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for\npolicymakers. For us at the Fed, the response has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ\nsignificantly from the standard policies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these\nexceptional circumstances. As such, they will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is\nmore clearly headed toward sustainable growth and price stability. This morning I would like to discuss the precepts that\nunderlie these nontraditional policies and some tactical issues we must address in unwinding them. I should note that these are\nmy own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\n\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds\ntarget rate, which had been the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be\nreduced below zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the\nfunctioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align riskadjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the Federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across\nthe entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that\narbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not\naffect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional policies. These can be broadly categorized in three groups.\nThe first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely discount window lending\nthrough which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral. Since\nAugust 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including reducing\nthe discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new lending\nfacilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for financial\nactors who are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of GSE notes. This can\nbe seen as an extension of traditional open-market operations: the Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly\ndifferent scale.\nWithin these groups, there are a number of particular programs or facilities, each with its own terms and conditions. Taken as\na whole, our nontraditional policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\" (TSLF, PDCF, etc.).\nBut there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first is insurance: Don't\nput all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the third is size: In an\nenvironment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of these precepts in\nturn, before concluding with some thoughts about the return to traditional policies.\n\nInsurance\n\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks that emerged in the past two years and the speed at\nwhich they emerged. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial system, stable growth, and price\nstability; and diagnosing each risk raised difficult questions. We saw failures in parts of the financial system. How serious were\nthey, and how would they affect the rest of the economy? We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, with\nmonth–to–month job losses and sales declines as steep as any in recent memory. Finally, prices declined for the first time in\ndecades. Were we about to slide into an extended period of deflation?\nThe diagnosis was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that we considered\nbrought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies. Which\ntreatment was appropriate and could be implemented in a timely fashion, particularly given the practical and legal constraints\n\n\fwe were facing? Under what circumstances and for how long should it be applied? How should the treatment be scaled back as\nconditions improve?\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on\nany single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope\nthat we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\nInnovation\n\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss\none program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change.\nLet us look at the Term Asset–Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nThe market for asset–backed securities has long played a vital role in funding loans to consumers and small businesses. This\nmarket effectively shut down in October 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. In response the Fed announced the\nformation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF provides loans to investors to finance their\npurchases of certain highly–rated asset–backed securities, with the securities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nAs conditions evolved we modified the facility along multiple dimensions, even before it began its operations at the beginning\nof April. The first markets targeted by the facility were those for securities backed by relatively simple assets. These securities\nwere familiar to market participants and their pricing was relatively straightforward. Then we moved on to more complex and\nlong–lived instruments.\nInitially the only eligible securities were those backed by newly and recently originated auto, credit card, and student loans, and\nsmall business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. In April, other securities were made eligible, namely,\nloans backed by mortgage servicing advances, leases of business equipment or vehicle fleets, and dealer inventories. This month,\neligibility was broadened to commercial mortgage–backed securities.\nWe changed the acceptable origination date as well. Initially, securities were eligible for TALF only if they were backed by new\nor recently issued loans. The intent was to bring the asset–backed market back to life by directly financing investors willing to\npurchase the securities, and therefore indirectly funding the loans that backed them. In March 2009, the Fed signaled that\nTALF could be extended to legacy assets, with the intention of stimulating the extension of new credit generally by easing\nbalance sheet pressures on potential lenders.\nFinally, the maximum maturity of TALF loans has been extended from three years to five, and in February the maximum size\nof the operation was increased from $200 billion to $1 trillion to match the growing list of eligible securities.\nAdmittedly TALF has generated two opposite concerns: one is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to\nfund large volumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck\na good balance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent\ncredit quality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not\nintended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former\nlevel of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal rather is to jump–start these markets back to life by\nmitigating some of the stresses they are experiencing. In turn, this should allow them to reach their appropriate size in a less\ndisruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on asset–backed securities have\ncome down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some institutional investors are\nre–entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have\nlabeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in\nthe Fed funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nLast March, as the Fed gave notice that TALF would be expanded, we also announced a considerable increase in the size of\nanother program, our large–scale asset purchases in which we buy agency debt, agency-guaranteed mortgage–backed securities,\nand Treasury securities. These actions, taken together, represented a substantial escalation of our nontraditional policies, and\nthey will probably maintain or increase the size of our balance sheet well above what it was until a year ago.\nI think this aggressive move was appropriate considering the many risks we were facing, the direness of some forecasts, and the\nuncertainty surrounding our new tools. Future developments will help us determine if our actions to date have been too much,\ntoo little, or just right.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper\ndesign required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take\ntime to affect economic activity. So I expect to see further deterioration in some areas, notably job market conditions, before\n\n\four policies gain full traction. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest\nactions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as\ninadequate.\nOver time the degree of success of specific programs will let us reconsider the size of our actions. If we find that a given\nprogram is not proving as useful as we anticipated, we would be faced with a choice between making its terms more attractive\n(and taking on more risk) or letting it lapse. We will then need to keep in mind that the same level of aggressiveness may not\nbe warranted by the circumstances of the day. Indeed, the possibility that the economy is close to a turning point is stronger\nnow than just two months ago. Financial market spreads have improved even as long Treasury and mortgage rates have\nincreased. And disinflationary pressures have been weaker than we had feared. Part of rightsizing will be to decide where\nboldness ends.\nBack to normal\n\nOver time, as the economy moves toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the Fed will progressively return to its\ntraditional policies—that is, setting the Fed funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short–term loans, so as these programs come to\nan end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to\nbe unattractive in normal times, and attractive only to those who really need them in these unusual times. As they cease to be\nuseful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being used less and we should see that trend continue as\nconditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to\nreduce it actively so that monetary policy can be easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out as we\nwere on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our assets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse\nrepurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on\nreserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could\nrequire sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem\nwith our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the Fed funds rate near the target. Finally,\nas we announced in March, we are seeking with the help of the Treasury additional tools through legislative action. An example\nof such tools would be the authority to issue interest–bearing debt in exchange for reserves or an expansion of the\nSupplementary Financing Program.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance\nsheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast in a matter of weeks last fall, and\nremains large. There are historical precedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit\nexpansion and to be subsequently associated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: inflationary\npressures will not arise without broader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present. Nevertheless, these\nprecedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the growth in our balance\nsheet.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the\nremarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast\nfor 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two\nconflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of\ncapacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed,\nsome statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent\nwe might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely consumers' and businesses' expectations of\nfuture inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise\nconsidering the severity of the downturn. But as economic conditions improve consumers and businesses might expect upward\npressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation expectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many\neconomic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, with core inflation near 2 percent, I see inflation at a level that would be acceptable under normal circumstances.\nBut these two potentially strong forces work in opposite directions, and the Fed must be in a position to respond, whichever\nforce dominates.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from\ntraditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety\nof risks we faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends remain\n\n\funchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable growth, and\nprice stability. As economic conditions improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction in our balance sheet, these\nends remain uppermost in our minds.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 11/30/09\n\nCentral Banking in Times of Crisis\nCzech National Bank\nPrague, Czech Republic\nIntroduction\n\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to participate in this important discussion.\nWe are in the midst of the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years. Extraordinary disruptions in the flow of credit and\nliquidity have weighed on the economies in the United States, Central and Eastern Europe, and around the world. As events\nhave unfolded over the past 20 months, the Federal Reserve, together with the United States Treasury and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), has implemented a broad range of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in our financial\nsystem and the fallout on the rest of the economy.\nI believe that our interventions are helping to address the difficulties we face and to eventually move the United States back to\nfinancial stability and economic recovery. And, as you are all well aware, capital flows are international. So, these efforts should\nalso be positive factors for financial markets and economic activity around the world.\nToday I will concentrate my remarks on the Fed's responses to the liquidity and credit shocks that have affected the U.S.\nfinancial system. I will also discuss the challenges that lie ahead and our continued commitment to confront them. I should\nnote that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCredit and liquidity shocks\n\nTrouble began in 2007, when falling housing prices and rising mortgage defaults produced strains in the market for securitized\nmortgages. As a result, many financial institutions reported severe losses. Famous names such as Bear Stearns, Wachovia,\nWashington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG), were on that list. Some of\nthese firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear\nStearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange\nloans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps\nwritten by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses, no sale or loan support could be made\nat suitable terms. As a result, Lehman went into bankruptcy last September.\nLehman Brothers' bankruptcy intensified market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as\nover the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money\nmarket industry. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these redemptions,\nsome funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThe disruptions in the money market industry were the product of two main shocks: a credit shock and a liquidity shock. First,\nbecause of deteriorating economic conditions, market participants expected greater losses on commercial paper and other\nshort-term securities. This is what I refer to as a \"credit shock.\" Second, the ease of trading these securities worsened:\ntransaction volumes shrank dramatically, and in some cases it was even difficult to obtain price quotes. This is what I call a\n\"liquidity shock.\" The two shocks are not independent, as deteriorating liquidity conditions can spillover to produce higher\nlosses among market participants. The interplay between credit and liquidity shocks made it difficult for firms to issue all but\nthe safest and most liquid commercial paper. Only very short-term, often overnight, debt was issued when market conditions\nwere at their worst.\nIt is easy to see the role that \"flight to quality\" played in these events. And I would like to underscore that \"flight to liquidity\"\nalone was sufficiently severe to disrupt the functioning of some markets that were largely immune from credit shocks. For\nexample, in the United States many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite these guarantees,\nliquidity disruptions have nearly shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a\ngood deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities\nbacked by student loans. A second example is the market for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Like other Treasury\nsecurities, TIPS benefit from the guarantee of the federal government. Yet, in past months they have traded at a significant\ndiscount relative to more liquid (on-the-run) nominal Treasuries.\n\n\fMonetary policy in exceptional times\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to these extraordinary events. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has lowered the target for the federal funds rate—our standard overnight interest rate policy lever—\nbringing it to essentially zero in December of last year. In addition, we have made adjustments to make it more attractive for\nbanks to borrow from the discount window.\nHowever, financial distress, the weak outlook for growth, and the prospects for unusually low inflation call for more policy\naccommodation. With the funds rate near zero, the Fed has had to work to find new ways to inject monetary accommodation\ninto the economy.\nOne way to make monetary policy more accommodating is to work to lower the unusual liquidity and risk premia that are\nraising private and longer-term borrowing costs. In this arena, the Federal Reserve has adopted several innovative policies that\nare providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets.\nSome of these policies were aimed at easing the liquidity pressures I spoke about earlier that hit the money market funds and\ncommercial paper markets last fall. Two important ones were the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (or MMIF) and the\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).\nMost recently, a new joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, became\neffective on March 19. The first lending through this temporary facility is designed to make credit available to consumers and\nsmall businesses on more favorable terms by facilitating the issuance of new asset-backed securities (ABS) and improving the\nmarket conditions for ABS more generally. The TALF is providing financing to investors to support their purchases of certain\nhighly-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans\nguaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Purchasers of these ABS will be able to borrow from the TALF, using the\nsecurities themselves as collateral.\nThe ABS market has typically played a critical role in providing credit to U.S. consumers and small businesses. However, this\nmarket has virtually closed since the worsening of the financial crisis last October. The TALF is aimed at re-opening this\nmarket by helping lenders finance new issues. Moreover, the program provides a lending backstop that will enhance the\nliquidity value of TALF-eligible securities. Since the announcement of the TALF, liquidity conditions in these securities have\nalready improved. It is important to note that the TALF loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably\nlonger than those available through other Fed lending facilities. So, TALF can impact longer-run interest rates.\nAnother important feature of the TALF is that the terms on these loans are attractive during current market conditions but are\nmore costly than those that prevail during more normal times. So, TALF loans will become unattractive when conditions\nimprove in markets for traditional sources of funding. Appropriate haircuts on the collateral and funding from the Treasury\nprovide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. For instance, the Fed already is\nundertaking a substantial expansion of the TALF. Last Thursday we added four new categories to the list of TALF-eligible ABS.\nAnd yesterday an expansion of the TALF to legacy assets was announced, with the new assets expected to include non-agency\nresidential and commercial mortgaged-backed securities.\nMoreover, on March 18 the FOMC decided to further increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by purchasing up\nto $1.15 trillion of additional securities, comprising (up to) $300 billion of longer-term Treasuries, (up to) $750 billion more of\nagency mortgage-backed securities, and (up to) $100 billion more of agency debt. Prices of Treasuries jumped sharply after the\nFOMC announcement, with the ten-year yield falling nearly 50 basis points over the day.\nTogether with the Treasury and the FDIC, the Fed earlier had also taken exceptional measures to attenuate the effect of the\ncredit shock. For example, we provided assistance to JPMorgan Chase in the acquisition of Bear Stearns, and we arranged the\nring-fencing of some non-performing assets held by Citi and Bank of America. Moreover, we provided capital to support the\npurchase of some collateralized debt obligations and the unwinding of AIG's credit default swap positions.\nAdditional interventions to deal with the credit crisis are being implemented. For instance, there is the Treasury's Financial\nStability Plan. The plan includes a Capital Assistance Program to strengthen U.S. financial institutions so that they have\nsufficient lending capacity to better support economic recovery. The plan also includes a Public-Private Investment Program,\naimed at providing greater means for financial institutions to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as\n\"legacy\" assets. Many of the details of this program were released yesterday, including the expansion of the Fed's TALF to\nlegacy assets that I just mentioned.\nWhen economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the\nFed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this\nwind-down process will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features\n\n\fof these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have\nbeen put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with\nbetter economic and financial performance.\nConceptual motivations for these new initiatives\n\nLet me briefly step back and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage\nmoves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets.\nThis is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing\nrates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. When financial markets are functioning well, the Fed can focus on the\nsize of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Because of balancesheet capacity limitations, or because of higher-than-normal uncertainty and risk aversion, market participants are largely\navoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For instance, as I mentioned previously, liquidity disruptions have made it\ndifficult to attract investors to several types of securities backed by student loans, even in the presence of a federal government\nguarantee.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in\nto take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. If they were, they could ease liquidity\npressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this market segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less\nlikely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus can significantly improve that market's functioning, seeding its transition to\nmore normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for focusing our nontraditional policies on loans and securities\nthat affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets that are not the\nparticular focus of policy intervention could experience some relative disadvantage because of the segmentation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Market participants\nwill become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and segmentation will diminish. This will diminish both\nthe need and usage of the special programs we have created.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over\ntime and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nThe programs I discussed today will help improve credit and liquidity conditions in U.S. financial markets. Since capital flows\nare international, these initiatives have the potential to positively impact capital markets around the world as well.\nThe Federal Reserve has also worked together with other countries to address pressures in global money markets directly. For\ninstance, the Fed has established temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with several nations' central banks.\nThese facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets and to make it easier to obtain U.S.\ndollar funding.\nOther international efforts are in place to provide direct support to countries that have been particularly affected by the\nfinancial crisis. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided funds to several Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries, including Latvia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Belarus; and Romania is in talks with the IMF. Moreover, the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group, and the World Bank\nGroup recently pledged to provide up to €24.5 billion to support the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe and to\nfund lending to businesses hit by the global economic crisis.\n\nConclusions\n\nModern economic theories usually imply that there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in\ntechnology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This logic would carry\nover to financial shocks as well, if we chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that policy has a very different role to play in mitigating the impact of financial shocks.\nFor one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the financial intermediation process. This means\nthere could be alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\nSince August 2007, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated to deal with the \"adverse feedback loop\" between\ndisruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced not only the setting of the funds rate,\nbut also the implementation of several new policies aimed directly at the financial shocks, some of which I have discussed\ntoday.\nI believe these initiatives will help in restoring the normal functioning of the financial system. They will also have a stabilizing\neffect on markets around the world and will therefore eventually help stimulate worldwide economic recovery.\n\n\fNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

        "content": "Office of the President\n\nMoney Museum\n\nLast Updated: 11/30/09\n\nEconomic Outlook and Policy Challenges\nRockford Chamber of Commerce\nRockford, IL\nIntroduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. And thank you, Einar Forsman, [President and CEO of\nthe Rockford Chamber of Commerce], for that kind introduction.\nCurrently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the\nlarge downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Many manufacturing-intensive\ncommunities, like Rockford, have been particularly hard hit. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the\noutlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these\nare, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBackground\n\nOver the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial\nservices industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a\nsignificant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six\nmonths. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and to bolster aggregate demand. As you know,\nyesterday, the President signed the $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill. And last week, the Treasury recommended new proposals to\ndeal with the financial sector problems. These actions, I believe, will help in addressing the difficulties we face and in moving\nus toward financial stability and economic recovery.\nThese certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages.\nThe problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and\nthe prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital\npositions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the\nfall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets,\ndeclines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities.\nThese factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\nA series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses. Famous\nnames like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group\n(AIG) were on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial\ninstitutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the\nTreasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had\nexposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last\nSeptember, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\nThese developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as\nthe ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money\nmarket industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to commercial paper and other short-term credit markets.\nWorried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate\nassets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThis process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls\nthrough these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been\nable to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system,\nsqueezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\n\fActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in\nthe financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its standard monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last\nyear.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more\nhad to be done to facilitate market functioning.\nAt first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—\nwhich is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\nGiven the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to\ndirectly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions. The Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the\neconomy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nMost of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that\nengage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo\nmarket. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a\nnumber of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—\ngenerally not more than 90 days.\nMore recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began\npurchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage\nmarkets.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and\nbegan to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies.\nCongress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets\nRelief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial\nsystem to support the lending capacity of banks.\nLast week, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the Plan is to combine public and\nprivate capital in an effort to value illiquid assets and move them off of banks' balance sheets.\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are\nbeginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for\ninterbank lending, and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate, have come down appreciably since October\nparticularly at the one-month maturity. More than $150 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating\nmedium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have\ndeclined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity riskfree government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect\nspreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing shortly before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly\nunderpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\nOver the longer run, policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets\nwill help move us toward a new benchmark and more stable financial conditions. This will not be an easy process, and it could\ntake time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until\nthey do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated\nsignificantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6\npercent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and home prices\nhave led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our\nexports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more\npessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by\ninvestors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending\ncommitments.\n\n\fTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending.\nOverall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a\n3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter—moreover, recent data suggest that the revisions will make this figure even worse. Last\nquarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate,\nand consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the\nrecessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Although\npreliminary data for January were positive for retail sales, there continues to be weakness in housing starts, employment, and\nauto sales. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will\nbegin to expand later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup\nreflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the\nstrains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In\naddition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full impact is still unclear, and our forecast could need\nsome recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the\npace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see\ngrowth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment\nrate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food\nand energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy\nand other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity.\nLooking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood\nof some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases.\nConsequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over\nthe longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the\nneighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that\ninflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\nSome Perspectives on Policy\n\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to\ncombat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus\nstimulates aggregate demand.\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With\nthe fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary\npressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to\nimpart monetary stimulus to the economy.\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and\ncommunications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions\nmade by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual,\nendorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an\nanchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising\nprivate and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena,\nadopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if\nnecessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities\nLoan Facility, or TALF. And last week the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF.\nAlthough not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the\ndemand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a\ndepressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the\nTALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus\nTALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large\nhaircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our\nother lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\n\n\fI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the\npurchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly\neffective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\nLet me step back for a minute and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system,\narbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across\nmarkets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect\nborrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the\nliquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balancesheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely\navoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal\ngovernment. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate securities markets that\nstudent loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in\nattracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in\nto take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity\npressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to\nleak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal,\nseeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies\nfocus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is\nthat markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Financial firms will\nbecome more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need\nand effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over\ntime and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the\nsize of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate.\nSome of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design\nfeatures of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities\nthat have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated\nwith better economic and financial performance.\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses\nduring the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending\nfacilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us\nto continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability\nworldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and\nother governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its\ndifficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.
