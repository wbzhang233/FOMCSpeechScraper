Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nOpening Remarks at the\nCollaboration for Inclusive Economic Development:\nA Forum for Philanthropies, Policymakers, and Practitioners\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, MA\nNovember 29, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Eric Rosengren, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and the Living Cities Collaborative for\norganizing this public forum exploring new opportunities for advancing economic opportunity and\neconomic mobility. Based on every event I have attended at the Boston Fed over many years, I know that\nI will come away with new insights and I look forward to our conversation.\n\nFed governance is arcane and I’m not planning to talk about it today except to say that I chair the\ncommittee across the Reserve Banks that focuses on the Fed’s community development work. I have\nbeen asked to present some opening remarks on these efforts, why they are important to our mission of\nfostering a healthy economy, and what the Fed is doing to encourage more inclusive growth. My remarks\nwill reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed in the Community\nThe origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. The CRA was intended to help ensure equitable access to credit for all\nindividuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the\ncommunities in which they are chartered to do business. To help these institutions comply with the CRA,\nthe Fed built a function to provide technical training and other support.\n\nOver time, the Fed’s interest and activities in community development have grown: today, community\ndevelopment is one of the Fed’s core business functions. The financial health and access to economic\nopportunity of consumers and communities is a key component of the country’s overall economic health\nand resiliency. The Fed recognizes that in order to perform our various duties, we need to have a good\nunderstanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities as well as more\naffluent areas. This understanding helps ensure that we are taking a consistent approach to advancing the\n\n\f2\nCRA and promoting access to credit, investment, and financial services across low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, small businesses, and communities. Our relationships with community development\norganizations and philanthropies at the local level provide us with valuable sources of information about\nthe economic health of people across various segments of the population and across the communities in\nour Districts, and this helps us gauge the effectiveness of our monetary policy. Our community\ndevelopment work also helps us gather information on developing trends in financial services and markets\nthat could raise risks to bank safety and soundness or to financial stability more broadly.\n\nMany factors determine the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods, including access to\ncredit, capital, and financial services; affordable housing; workforce development; job training and\neducation; health and wellness services; and infrastructure, including transportation and broadband\nservices. Over the next several years, our Community Development staffs across the Federal Reserve\nSystem will be focusing their efforts on advancing the economic resiliency and mobility of low- and\nmoderate-income and underserved households and communities. What factors make certain individuals\nand communities better able to recover from economic setbacks, and how can those factors be promoted\nbroadly? Why are some places and households mired in persistent poverty, and what can be done to turn\naround those bad outcomes? What factors allow people to move up the economic ladder regardless of\nwhere they live or their racial or gender makeup? What policies can ensure broad access to economic\nopportunity for all people and places?\n\nThese are hard questions. The Fed is committed not only to increasing knowledge about the economic\nchallenges facing low- and moderate-income households and communities, but also to helping to identify\neffective policies and best practices to address these challenges. We aim to do that by gathering and\ndisseminating data; conducting applied, action-focused research; and holding forums such as this one.\nWe strive to conduct our data gathering and research with the utmost rigor and the highest standards of\nquality, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our engagement with\n\n\f3\ncommitted stakeholders like you is critical to ensuring that our research hits the mark, that it contributes\nto the public discourse, and that it informs public policy and yields concrete and positive outcomes. The\npeople in this room know very well that the issues facing lower-income households and communities in a\ndynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many of the solutions will be complex as well and will\ntake committed and collaborative actions from all of us.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development Work in Action\nI’d like to conclude my opening remarks by highlighting just a few examples of the Federal Reserve’s\nefforts in community development.\n\nOn the access-to-credit front, the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection program allows community\nand economic development organizations in the District to have project proposals pre-screened by Kansas\nCity Fed staffers to determine whether the project is CRA-eligible. The organizations then get a chance\nto pitch their proposals to potential funders, including financial institutions and community foundations.\nSince 2011, Investment Connection has facilitated more than $30 million in loans, investments, grants,\nand services to community economic development organizations. And because the program has been\nsuch a success, other Federal Reserve Districts, including Minneapolis, St. Louis, New York, and\nCleveland, have either started or are considering piloting programs of their own.\n\nAn example of the Fed’s data gathering, dissemination, and analysis, our annual Small Business Credit\nSurvey, has become a trusted source of information on the conditions of firms with fewer than 500\nemployees. This survey and the associated analysis, which is a collaboration among all 12 Reserve\nBanks, are used by a wide range of stakeholders seeking to understand the financing needs of the small\nbusiness sector, an important driver of the economy.\n\n\f4\nIn terms of our collaborative efforts, workforce development is a key issue that affects economic vitality\nacross all regions. So, considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our\ncommunity partners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skilldevelopment programs needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce.\nThe Federal Reserve System is engaged with the Heldrich Center at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall\nCenter at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Upjohn Institute in an effort called Investing in\nAmerica’s Workforce. This initiative seeks to align the skills of the workforce with employers’ needs by\nreframing the discussion of workforce development efforts as investments rather than costly social\nservices. Earlier this month, the initiative released a three-volume set presenting workforce development\nprograms and policies that are considered to be best-practice in terms of delivering positive returns to\nsociety, employers, workers, and job seekers. The volumes were a culmination of many listening sessions\nand engagement with a vast number of practitioners and academics from across the country.\n\nIn addition to these collaborative efforts across the Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank also does\nwork on the issues and needs of low- and moderate-income households and communities that are\nespecially relevant to their individual Districts. An excellent example of this is the Boston Fed’s Working\nCities Challenge, which began in 2013. Informed by the Boston Fed’s research and designed in\npartnership with its network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a\ngrant competition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas\nand households in the Northeast in an enduring way.\n\nAnother example is the Cleveland Fed’s work on the opioid crisis, an issue that disproportionately affects\nthe people in our District and their ability to productively engage in the economy. Cleveland Fed research\nhas documented the effects of opioids on different segments of the population, in terms of race and\ngender, and across geographic areas. In addition to research, the Cleveland staff has engaged our\ncommunity contacts and advisory councils to provide insights into this public-health problem, which is\n\n\f5\nhaving significant economic consequences in terms of workforce attachment.\n\nAs I said, this is just a taste of the type of work being undertaken by the Federal Reserve to better\nunderstand and help to provide workable solutions to these complex community development challenges.\nThese problems are not going to solve themselves. Determining viable solutions will take collaboration\namong all stakeholders, as underscored by the title of today’s program, Collaboration for Inclusive\nEconomic Development. As I am certain you are too, I am looking forward to today’s panel sessions\nfeaturing leaders from philanthropic foundations and some of my Fed colleagues. They will discuss the\nbarriers to inclusive economic progress, what responses are being brought to bear, and where the Federal\nReserve System, philanthropies, and others can collaborate to foster further innovative approaches and\nsolutions. Thank you all for being here today to participate in this important dialog.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and\nNormal Policymaking Now and in the Future\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nMoney Marketeers of New York University, Inc.\nNew York, NY\nOctober 25, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me back to speak tonight. When I\nwas here four years ago, I discussed the important role that Federal Reserve communications play in\nmaking effective monetary policy and the need for these communications to evolve as we moved from a\nperiod of extraordinary monetary policymaking to more normal policymaking. At this point, that\ntransition to more normal policymaking has been underway for some time, reflecting the health of the\nU.S. economy and the progress that’s been made on the FOMC’s monetary policy goals. Tonight, I’ll\ntalk about the economic outlook and monetary policy, FOMC communications, and upcoming\nconsiderations that will help determine what normal policymaking will look like in the future. My\nremarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\nFrom the perspectives of the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, the U.S. economy\nis doing very well. Growth has been running above trend for the past couple of years, inflation has\nmoved up to the FOMC’s 2 percent target, and labor markets are very strong. The unemployment rate is\nat its lowest level since the late 1960s and job growth is well above trend.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and it has been running around 3 percent over the\nfirst three quarters of this year. Early this month, longer-term interest rates moved up, and over the past\ncouple of weeks, volatility in equity markets has increased. While a deeper and more persistent drop in\nequity markets could dash confidence and lead to a significant pullback in risk-taking and spending, we\nare far from this scenario. The S&P 500 index remains higher than it was a year ago. Similar to the\nswings in the market we saw earlier this year, the movements of late do not seem to be signaling that\ninvestors are becoming overly pessimistic. While the market volatility poses a risk to the forecast and\nbears monitoring, it has not led me to change my modal medium-run outlook. I expect growth to come in\n\n\f2\na tad above 3 percent this year and to be in the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range next year, well above my 2\npercent estimate of the economy’s trend growth rate.\n\nBoth consumer and business spending are making solid contributions to growth and I expect that to\ncontinue. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market. In the\naggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making\nfor sound balance sheets. The changes in tax policy that became effective earlier this year added a\npositive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending.\n\nBusiness activity and spending have also been healthy. Investment in equipment and intellectual property\nhas strengthened this year and strong order flows suggest that strength will continue. The changes in tax\npolicy, including lower corporate tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and\nintangibles, support further business spending. Increased federal government spending is also a positive\nfor growth over the next couple of years. Despite the uncertainty around trade and tariff policies,\nbusiness sentiment is high. Earlier, when the expansion was getting underway, businesses’ main concern\nwas weak demand; now it is the difficulty in finding workers to keep up with strong demand.\n\nThe housing market has slowed somewhat over the past year. Some softening is to be expected as interest\nrates have moved up; the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about a percentage point higher than a year ago.\nIn some areas, a lack of housing supply may also be negatively weighing on housing activity. In addition,\nthe tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership, including the limit on the\ndeduction for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes, and the limit on the mortgage interest\ndeduction, both of which will affect those taxpayers who continue to itemize deductions. I am not\nanticipating a strong pullback in housing over the next year, but I also do not expect it to be a strong\nengine of growth for the overall economy.\n\n\f3\nGrowth abroad has improved in recent years, but forecasts have recently been revised down. The\ndivergence between economic growth prospects abroad and in the U.S. puts upward pressure on the dollar\nand suggests that net exports – the difference between exports and imports – will likely be a small drag on\nU.S. growth over the next couple of years. However, this assessment is complicated by the uncertainty\naround trade and tariff policies. The recent U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to replace NAFTA\nreduced some of this uncertainty, but rules under which the firms operate – for example, what constitutes\noff-shore content – still need to be worked out and the agreement needs Senate approval. The impact of\ntrade developments between the U.S. and China will depend on the actions ultimately taken and on\nwhether the uncertainty itself leads to a pullback in spending. The majority of business contacts from my\nDistrict report that they have not changed their plans or revenue outlook in response to concerns about\nescalating trade tensions. However, some manufacturing contacts have reported that the tariffs have been\nquite disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs\nof production. These effects could last for some time because reorganizing supply chains cannot be done\nquickly. Thus, the tariffs will act as a tax on inputs to U.S. production and are a headwind to productivity\ngrowth, which has been low during the expansion.\n\nLabor Markets\nAbove-trend growth has led to continued strong job growth and declines in the unemployment rate.\nPayroll job gains have averaged over 200,000 jobs per month this year, up from about 180,000 per month\nlast year, and are well above most estimates of trend, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000.\nAnother sign of a strong labor market is the stability of the labor force participation rate, which\ndemographics suggest will be trending down over time. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4\npercent for the past six months. It fell to 3.7 percent in September, which is lower than the levels reached\nduring the past two expansions, and is well below my 4.5 percent estimate of the unemployment rate that\nis sustainable over the longer run. I expect that strong growth will support further tightening of the labor\nmarket, with the unemployment rate falling to slightly under 3-1/2 percent by the end of next year.\n\n\f4\n\nAs I mentioned, firms continue to report that it is very difficult to find workers. These reports are coming\nfrom a variety of industries, across skill levels and geographic regions. Firms are responding to labor\nshortages by offering higher wages and more flexible work schedules. In fact, some of my contacts tell\nme they are offering incentive payments to workers based solely on their attendance. Other firms tell me\nthey are automating faster, although they recognize that finding even the reduced number of workers\nneeded for automated plants is going to be a problem in the short run. Some manufacturers have told me\nthey would be investing more in plant and equipment if they thought they could find workers. So the\ntightness in labor markets may develop into a headwind on growth.\n\nThe official statistics on wages and compensation have been lagging the anecdotal reports, but recently,\nthe readings have caught up. Various year-over-year measures of wage growth are nearing 3 percent, up\nfrom 2 percent early in the expansion. Some people ask: if labor markets are so tight, why aren’t we\nseeing wage growth in the 3 to 4 percent range like we saw in the prior two expansions? This is a\nlegitimate question.\n\nFirst, it has to be acknowledged that it is difficult to know with any precision how tight labor markets are;\nmaybe they aren’t as tight as we once thought. In fact, the behavior of labor force participation and the\nfact that wage growth has remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened have led many\npolicymakers to reassess the level of the unemployment rate they view as sustainable in the long run.\nFive years ago, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate among FOMC\npolicymakers ranged from 5.2 to 5.8 percent. 1 In projections this September, the central tendency was\n\n1\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nSeptember 17-18, 2013.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20130918.pdf)\n\n\f5\nabout a percentage point lower, at 4.3 to 4.6 percent, with a median projection of 4.5 percent. 2 Over time,\nI have also moved down my own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to my current estimate of\n4.5 percent.\n\nBut even relative to these lower longer-run estimates, labor markets are tight, and based on a broad set of\nlabor market indicators, my assessment is that we are beyond maximum employment, one part of the\nFed’s monetary policy mandate. So there is still some explaining to do regarding the relatively moderate\nwage growth we’ve seen so far. Much of the explanation lies with the low levels of inflation and\nproductivity growth over this expansion. 3 The recent increase in nominal wage growth reflects the recent\nfirming in both factors, but I wouldn’t expect to see a strong acceleration in wages unless we see a strong\npickup in productivity growth. Such a scenario would be welcome, since wage growth reflecting higher\nproductivity growth does not contribute to inflationary pressures in a competitive economy.\n\nInflation\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in\nthe price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The goal is symmetric,\nmeaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently\nbelow this goal and such persistent deviations would warrant a policy response. 4 But month-to-month\nvariations in the inflation measures, due to idiosyncratic factors or in response to temporary economic and\n\n2\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nSeptember 25-26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180926.pdf)\n\n3\n\nOver the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\nexpansion, the annualized growth rate of labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, has been about 1.1 percent, less than half the pace over the prior two expansions.\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n\n\f6\nfinancial disturbances, are to be expected. Policymakers look through temporary undershoots or\novershoots of our inflation goal and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis.\n\nAs the expansion has continued, inflation has gradually firmed, consistent with reports from business\ncontacts that they now have a greater ability to raise their own prices in response to higher input costs and\nstrong demand. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, have been\nrunning near 2 percent for several months. Inflation expectations have been stable, and this has helped\nanchor inflation despite the tightness in labor markets and the strength of the economy. In this\nenvironment, maintaining stable inflation expectations will be the key to maintaining inflation at target.\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, my outlook is that inflation will remain near 2 percent,\nsubject to the usual monthly variations in the measures.\n\nMonetary Policy and Communications\nAt its meeting in September, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis\npoints, to 2 to 2-1/4 percent, and continued on its pre-announced plan for gradually reducing the amount\nof assets held on its balance sheet.\n\nAs the economy has improved, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy to gradually reduce the\nextraordinary accommodation that was put in place to address the Great Recession. This approach is one\nthat balances the upside and downside risks to achieving and maintaining our dual mandate goals so that\nthe expansion is sustained. We want to avoid a buildup in risks to macroeconomic stability that could\narise if the economy were allowed to overheat, but we also want to avoid choking off the expansion. In\naddition, gradually reducing accommodation helps mitigate the risks of financial imbalances that can arise\nin a low interest rate environment. Currently, I would characterize these risks as moderate. But growth in\nleveraged lending is strong, commercial real estate valuations are lofty, and I believe we are at a point in\nthe business cycle where increased attention to financial stability risk is warranted because the economy\n\n\f7\ncontinues to grow above trend and financial conditions remain accommodative, even taking into account\nthe recent increase in long-term interest rates.\n\nAs the funds rate target gets closer to the range of estimates of the neutral rate – the level of interest rates\nconsistent with stable prices and maximum employment in the long run – we are nearing the completion\nof the exit from the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking and moving close to a period of\nnormal policymaking. Our communications are appropriately changing. You may have noticed that in\nSeptember, we removed language indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\nThis wasn’t meant to signal any change in policy strategy or the likely path of policy. Indeed, we said\nthat given the economic outlook we expect further gradual increases in the funds rate will likely be\nwarranted. Instead, I view the change in language as an indication that we are getting back to a period of\nnormal policymaking.\n\nIn the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking, when the policy rate was at its effective lower\nbound, the FOMC used forward guidance about the expected future path of interest rates as a policy tool.\nWe conveyed that our future path was going to be very accommodative for a long time. But in normal\ntimes, there is no need to use guidance as a policy tool and there is less certainty around the future policy\npath. That path will depend on the evolution of economic conditions and their effect on the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. So instead of giving explicit guidance, normal policy\ncommunications should convey the rationale for policy decisions and the FOMC’s reaction function, that\nis, how policy is likely to systematically respond to changes in economic conditions – whether those\nchanges are anticipated or unanticipated.\n\nLet me underscore that just because the future policy path isn’t known with certainty and will depend on\neconomic developments doesn’t mean that policymakers will be nonsystematic in their approach to\npolicymaking. It just means that in normal times, it would be inappropriate to commit to a future path\n\n\f8\nbecause the path taken will depend on how economic conditions evolve. Let me also note that in addition\nto contributing to transparency and accountability, being systematic and communicating so that the public\nunderstands normal policymaking will make the forward guidance we use in extraordinary times more\neffective. They will understand that keeping interest rates lower for longer is not business as usual, and\nthis awareness can help put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n\nMight the return to normal policymaking be an argument for the FOMC’s dropping the so-called dot plot\nfrom the Summary of Economic Projections, as some have suggested we do? I think it would be a\nmistake to discontinue the dot plot. The dot plot provides information on the policy paths that individual\nFOMC participants view as appropriate to promoting the FOMC’s monetary policy goals. The dots can\nchange over time because of economic developments, but that’s a design feature, not a flaw. The FOMC\nalso provides a chart illustrating the uncertainty band around the median policy path across participants. 5\nIt clearly shows that the farther out in the projection horizon one goes, the wider the degree of uncertainty\n– this is a characteristic of normal policymaking. Omitting this information would not make the\ndivergence in views across FOMC participants or the uncertainty around their projections disappear, but it\nwould be a significant step back in transparency.\n\nLet me conclude by touching on two considerations that will help determine what normal policymaking\nlooks like in the future. The first is the operating framework the Fed uses to ensure that its policy rate is\n\n5\n\nThe FOMC began providing charts of the confidence bands around the median projections in the March 2017\nSummary of Economic Projections. For the latest charts, see the Summary of Economic Projections section of\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” September 25-26, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180926.pdf)\n\n\f9\nbeing maintained at the appropriate level, and the second is the monetary policy strategic framework that\nthe FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy rate is. 6\n\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: Operations and Strategy\nSince last October, the FOMC has been in the process of gradually and predictably reducing the holdings\nof Treasury and agency securities that were purchased to address the financial crisis and Great\nRecession. 7 We plan to shrink the balance sheet until the Fed is holding no more securities than\nnecessary to implement policy efficiently and effectively, and as noted in the minutes of the July FOMC\nmeeting, the FOMC will likely soon be resuming a discussion of what that implementation framework\nwill be. 8\n\nOne option is to try to return to operating like we did before the financial crisis, when the FOMC kept the\nsupply of bank reserves scarce. In June 2007, banks were holding about $10 billion in reserve accounts at\nthe Fed. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nand this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC’s target. But\nnow, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant. While reserve levels\nare down from their peaks, banks are still holding about $1.8 trillion in reserve accounts at the Fed, and\nalmost all of this is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the\n6\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks),\nand Mester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework)\n7\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n8\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” July 31-August 1, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)\n\n\f10\nsupply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into\nits target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase\nagreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. Reserves and currency are the main liabilities\non the Fed’s balance sheet, so the choice between these two frameworks will determine the volume of\nassets the Fed will hold on its balance sheet.\n\nBoth operating frameworks have proven to be effective during the periods in which they have been used.\nThere are several things to consider in determining which implementation framework will be most\neffective going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial crisis, 9 and\nthe regulatory changes put in place since the crisis have likely affected the banking system’s demand for\nreserve balances. This may limit the feasibility of returning to a framework with scarce reserves, and it\nalso raises the question of whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the general level of\nshort-term interest rates, regardless of the operating framework. On the other hand, a relatively large\nbalance sheet, which would accompany an abundant reserves framework, might be viewed with some\nskepticism or generate requests for the Fed to aid other industries or use the balance sheet to fund\ngovernment initiatives, as occurred during and since the crisis.10,11 I believe this type of risk can be\neffectively handled by clear and timely communication by the FOMC on the rationale for its decision\n\n9\n\nFor a review of changes in the fed funds market since the financial crisis, see Craig, Ben R. and Sara Millington,\n“The Federal Funds Market since the Financial Crisis,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nApril 5, 2017.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201707-the-federal-funds-market-since-the-financial-crisis.aspx)\n\n10\n\nFor example, during December 2008, as Congress debated a bailout for American automakers, several members\nof Congress requested of then-Chair Ben Bernanke that the Fed lend directly to auto companies. Needless to say,\nthe Fed was reluctant to go down this path, which would have put it squarely in the midst of industrial policy, a\nresponsibility of Congress. See the discussion in Chapter 17 of Ben S. Bernanke, The Courage to Act: A Memoir of\na Crisis and its Aftermath, New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2015.\n11\n\nMore recently, Congress used funds from the Fed’s surplus account to pay for highways and other budget\ninitiatives, and put limits on the size of the surplus. See the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Act, or FAST Act, and\nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.\n\n\f11\nabout the implementation framework, as well as its other policy decisions in pursuit of our goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhich brings me to the other important issue that will determine what normal monetary policymaking is\nin the future, namely, the strategic framework used to determine appropriate monetary policy. Currently,\nwe use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in effectively\npromoting our policy goals. But based on demographics, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors,\nmany economists anticipate that the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in\npast decades. This would mean there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a\nnegative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the effective lower bound would be\nhigher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the\npotential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of inflation well below target. 12\n\nSo we need to ask whether there are alternative policy strategies that could lower the probability of\ngetting into this situation, and at the July FOMC meeting, participants agreed to discuss this topic at\nfuture meetings. 13 Researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting an\ninflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflation-targeting range instead of a point goal, or\ntargeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather than for inflation. None of these alternative\nframeworks are without challenges but all are worth thorough review. It might be useful to do something\nakin to simulated stress testing to see how each framework might fare when confronted with things like\ndata revisions; uncertainty about the levels of the equilibrium interest rate, potential growth, and longer12\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n13\n\nSee “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” July 31-August 1, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180801.pdf)\n\n\f12\nrun unemployment rate; and the challenges of effective policy communications. My colleague Eric\nRosengren, president of the Boston Fed, recently put out a proposal for regular review of the Fed’s\nstrategic framework. 14 I support this idea; it makes sense to me that, as a matter of good governance, a\ncentral bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. I also believe that to\ninform our evaluation of the framework, we should seek a wide range of perspectives, including those\nfrom experts in academia, the private sector, and other central banks. I am confident in predicting that\nthere won’t be a consensus among this wide-ranging group, but I am equally confident in predicting that\nwe will ultimately get to a better decision – whether it be to stay with our current framework or adopt an\nalternative – if we listen to a diverse set of views on the subject.\n\n14\n\nSee Fuhrer, Jeffery C., Giovanni P.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, MO\nOctober 3, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank President Jim Bullard and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for inviting me to present the\nopening keynote address at the 2018 Conference on Community Banking in the 21st Century. This is the\nsixth conference in this important series sponsored by the Fed, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors,\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As you look at the agenda, you’ll see that it is\nquite distinct from other conferences in mixing together researchers, practitioners, regulators, and\npolicymakers. I am a big proponent of the thesis that examining issues from diverse perspectives and\ndiscussing those perspectives yields better policy and regulatory decisions. So I am very much looking\nforward to the conversations we will have over the next two days about the future of community banking.\nToday, I will focus the bulk of my remarks on the efforts being undertaken to modernize the Community\nReinvestment Act. The views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBanking is on a lot of people’s minds these days. Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the\nfailure of Lehman Brothers, a watershed moment at the start of the global financial crisis. It’s hard to\nhave lived through the crisis and not been changed by it. Researchers had to rethink their well-established\ntheories of how financial markets and institutions actually operate; they had to identify the deficiencies in\ntheir models and poor inferences from empirical analyses. Policymakers and regulators had to rethink the\neffectiveness of banking regulation and supervision in ensuring the stability of the financial system as a\nwhole; their eyes were opened to the inter-connectedness and complexity of the global financial system\nand its regulations. Bankers had to take stock of how they monitored the risks they were taking and\nwhether they had sufficient capital and liquidity to weather what could be unexpectedly deep shocks.\n\nMuch has changed over the past 10 years. Credit is generally available to financially healthy borrowers;\nthe financial system is now holding higher levels of capital and liquidity; credit quality is higher;\ninstitutions and supervisors have improved their monitoring of risk within institutions; and policymakers\n\n\f2\nare now working to identify emerging risks across the financial sector as a whole. Some of these\nimprovements were mandated by regulation, but others were undertaken by bankers themselves, having\nseen the damage that can be caused by not fully understanding the risks being taken. I think it would be a\nmistake to turn back the clock and unwind many of the important steps taken since the financial crisis to\nimprove financial system resiliency. At the same time, I support the efforts that are now underway to\nbetter align regulation and supervisory oversight with where the potential systemic risks lie, including\nproposals to make regulation less burdensome on community banks in the U.S. Better aligning our\nregulation and supervision with the risks imposed should allow for simplifications without sacrificing\nsafety, soundness, and stability. As we strive to make our regulations and supervision more effective and\nefficient, we must not forget the important lesson that maintaining a resilient financial system is necessary\nfor a healthy economy.\n\nCommunity Banks Are Trusted\nSaying that a healthy economy depends on a resilient financial system may seem like an obvious\nstatement for those in this room. But during the financial crisis, many people lost faith that the U.S.\nbanking system could deliver any benefits. The reputation of the financial industry and its regulators was\ndecidedly tarnished, some say deservedly so. But remarkably, the public did not lose faith in their local\nbanks. According to a survey published by the business schools at the University of Chicago and\nNorthwestern University, the public has put and continues to put more trust in their local banks than in\nnationwide banks, the stock market, or mutual funds. 1 I believe this is because the public understands\nthat community banks are important to the economic vitality of households, small businesses, and\n\n1\n\nThe University of Chicago’s Booth School and Northwestern University’s Kellogg School publish the Financial\nTrust Index, which is based on an annual survey of a representative sample of about 1,000 American households.\nThe 2015 results (wave 24) give trust by bank category. I thank Professor Luigi Zingales at the University of\nChicago for providing the updated results for 2017. In the 2017 survey, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means “I do\nnot trust them at all” and 5 means “I trust them completely,” the average response was 3.6 for local banks, 3.0 for\nnational banks, 2.7 for the stock market, and 2.9 for mutual funds.\n\n\f3\nneighborhoods. 2 Before turning to the Community Reinvestment Act, let me say a few words about the\nbenefits conveyed by community banks.\n\nCommunity Banks Play an Important Role in the Economy but Face Challenges\nBanks provide funding to creditworthy businesses and households. They offer customers methods for\nsaving and making payments. They help people and firms manage their financial affairs. Community\nbanks, in particular, play a crucial role in their local economies. In many small towns and rural areas,\nfinancial service providers are very limited except for community banks. 3 By investing in households and\nneighborhoods, they help promote economic prosperity in local communities. Community banks have\nbeen and continue to be an important source of credit to small businesses, which play an important role in\nthe U.S. economy. In fact, three-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees, and while\nlarger businesses employ the most people, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with\nfewer than 50 employees. 4 Because small businesses tend to have less available hard quantitative\ninformation, like audited financial statements, on which to make credit decisions, they have more limited\naccess to credit from large banks or capital markets. Community banks fill that void.\n\nResearch has documented that community banks have had some advantages over larger banks in\nextending loans to smaller firms for which public information is less available. Being local, community\nbanks can forge relationships with their customers. These relationships help community banks assess the\ncreditworthiness of smaller borrowers. According to the Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit\n\n2\n\nThe Federal Reserve classifies banking organizations with $10 billion or less in assets as community banks. Other\nanalysts define community banks as banks with assets of $1 billion or less. The FDIC uses a larger set of criteria\n(see FDIC, 2012).\n3\n4\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (2003).\n\nThese data are from Supplemental Tables F and G of the National Business Employment Dynamics Data, U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics. See Mester (2016) for further discussion of the role of small businesses in the economy.\n\n\f4\nSurvey, banks remain the most common source of financing for small businesses. 5 Community banks\naccount for about half of small-business bank lending in the U.S., and the Fed’s survey indicates that\nsmall businesses are more satisfied with their credit experience at small banks than at large banks or\nonline lenders. 6 And because they tend to finance themselves with core deposits and are less reliant on\nvolatile short-term funding sources, community banks are better able to continue to lend to their\ncustomers through times of adverse financial conditions. 7 So small banks offer a service that allows\nborrowers to weather turbulent times.\n\nDespite the benefits provided by community banks, they are facing some challenges. First, the banking\nindustry has been consolidating. Over the past two decades, the number of banking organizations has\nfallen from nearly 9,000 institutions to about 5,000, and the number of community banks, especially small\ncommunity banks, has fallen as well. 8 There are now about 1,200 banking organizations with assets of\n$100 million or less, down from about 4,000 two decades ago. At the same time, banks are getting larger.\nThere are nearly 30 banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets, compared with fewer than\n20 two decades ago, and the share of total industry assets held by these large institutions has risen from\n43 percent to nearly 70 percent.\n\nThe community bankers I speak with regularly report that they are facing higher costs of technology and\nincreased regulatory compliance burdens. These reports accord with the data in the national survey\n5\n\nFederal Reserve Banks (2017), page 14.\n\n6\n\nFederal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2017), Table 5, and Federal Reserve Banks\n(2017), pages 14 and 17. Eighty percent of respondents reported being satisfied with their credit experience at small\nbanks, compared with 78 percent at credit unions, 77 percent at community development financial institutions, 61\npercent at large banks, and 46 percent at online lenders.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSee Berlin and Mester (1999) and Berger, Bouwman, and Kim (2017).\n\nThese data are compiled from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Community Banking Study Reference\nData. A banking organization is defined as an independent bank or a top‐tier bank holding company, with assets\nconsolidated across all constituent subsidiaries. All dollar figures are adjusted for inflation and in 2017 dollars.\nMcCord and Prescott (2014) summarize the changes in the size distribution of banks and discuss some of the causes\nof the changes.\n\n\f5\nconducted in association with this conference. 9 In addition, large banks, fintech companies, and other\nnonbank providers of bank services have entered local markets. Developments suggest that the\nadvantages community banks have had in offering relationship lending may be shrinking over time. 10\nAutomated lending technologies, such as small-business credit scoring and data-modeling techniques,\nhave allowed larger banks to increase their share of small-business lending, and in recent years, small\nbusinesses have increasingly been turning to larger banks for funding. New technologies, including\nonline lending platforms, have also allowed nonbank alternative lenders to increase their share of smallbusiness lending. 11 The Federal Reserve Banks’ survey indicates that the smaller small businesses (those\nwith revenues of $1 million or less) frequently turn to online lenders or other nonbank sources for credit,\neven though they report less satisfaction with these lenders.\n\nSome of my own co-authored research has documented that cost considerations may be driving\ncommunity banks to increase their size. 12 First, the average cost per dollar of assets associated with\nregulatory compliance and technological change decreases with institutions’ asset size; in other words,\nthere are scale economies. Second, larger community banks, those with assets between $1 billion and\n$10 billion, appear to do a better job capitalizing on their investment opportunities than smaller\ncommunity banks, and they achieve better financial performance as a result. Given their current\nportfolios, these larger community banks also appear to have financial incentives to expand further into\nsmall-business lending. So we might expect the trend of larger banks providing a larger portion of smallbusiness lending to continue.\n\n9\n\nSee Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2017).\n\n10\n\nSee Hughes, Jagtiani, Mester, and Moon (2018) for a review of this literature.\n\n11\n\nSee the papers by Jagtiani and Lemieux (2016, 2018).\n\n12\n\nSee Hughes, Jagtiani, Mester, and Moon (2018).\n\n\f6\nFrom the borrowers’ and savers’ viewpoint, entry of new players, new technologies, and increased\ncompetition can be beneficial. But from community bankers’ perspective, these factors present\nchallenges and may spur banks to move into products and services with which they have less experience.\nThey also presents challenges to regulators who typically have less insight into nonbank financial\nproviders, making it more difficult to ensure that the institutions providing these services do so in a safe\nand sound manner.\n\nIn this challenging environment, the Federal Reserve has been working to ensure that our supervisory\noversight aligns with potential risks and that we are bringing a cost-benefit perspective to the rules we use\nto implement regulations. Recently, attention has turned to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and\nways we might make its implementation more effective and efficient given the technological and\ncompetitive changes affecting the banking environment.\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act Has Had a Positive Effect on Lending in Underserved Areas\nIn 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act to help address concerns about the\ndeterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S. At the time, many people\nblamed urban decline on limited credit availability and illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA\nreaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to\ndo business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods. 13\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors – the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) – are charged with implementing the\nact. Regulators periodically review how well a bank is serving the needs in its geographic service area,\nidentified by the bank based on the location of its branches and ATMs and where a substantial portion of\n13\n\nFor more on the historical context of the CRA, see Braunstein (2008) and Federal Reserve System (2014).\n\n\f7\nits loans are. The CRA requires regulators to make public the ratings and written evaluation of the banks’\nperformance on the CRA.\n\nThe Fed is deeply committed to ensuring that the goal of the CRA is met: that banks serve their entire\ncommunity and, in particular, the credit needs in low- and moderate-income areas. The Fed’s community\ndevelopment function, which grew out of our responsibilities with respect to the CRA, has been helping\nto build relationships between financial institutions and community development professionals. One\nexample is the Investment Connection program, developed by the Kansas City Fed, which links\ncommunity and economic development organizations with CRA-eligible projects with banks seeking such\ninvestments. 14 Work is currently underway to expand the program to other regions.\n\nThe word “community” is central to the CRA. A body of research has shown that economic opportunity\nis tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility – the probability that a\nchild will be better off economically than his or her parents – is dependent not only on the family’s\ncharacteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration,\nthe quality of schools, and access to social services. Lack of access to credit has been found to have longlasting negative effects on a neighborhood’s economic health, 15 and a body of evidence indicates that the\nCRA has provided some tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, although the\nmagnitude of the effects varies by study. 16\n\nBecause of the CRA, investment in low- and moderate-income areas is a fundamental part of bank\nportfolios. Evidence suggests that, on the margin, bank lending in these areas is higher than it otherwise\n14\n\nSee Mester (2017) for further discussion of the Fed’s community development function. Information about\nInvestment Connection is available on the Kansas City Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/community/investmentconnection.\n15\n\nSee Aaronson, Hartley, and Mazumder (2018).\n\n16\n\nThe Chakrabarti, et al. (2009) volume provides a selection of research articles on the effects of the CRA.\n\n\f8\nwould be without the CRA, and that this lending does not appear to be crowding out lending from\nnonbank lenders, which are not subject to the CRA. There is evidence that CRA assessment areas tend to\nattract more investment than other comparable areas in a bank’s market, 17 although there is some\nvariation across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). For example, one study found a positive effect on\nlending in large MSAs but not in smaller ones. In particular, the study found that the CRA promotes\nmortgage credit supply to low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods in large metropolitan\nareas, particularly at times when merger activity is strong. This suggests that banks pay attention to the\nCRA’s incentives for compliance. 18\n\nIndeed, one way the CRA has encouraged investment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods is\nthrough the formation of so-called public or community benefit agreements.19 These have primarily been\nused by larger banks during a merger application process and involve the banks committing to a\nsignificant increase in lending over a period of years after a merger is completed. Such agreements can\nqualify for CRA credit, and in the view of some advocacy groups, these agreements can meaningfully\nincrease bank branches and lending in the communities.\n\nAnother, less direct, way the CRA might increase lending is by creating a positive information externality\nfor other lenders. For example, the study I mentioned which found an increase in mortgage lending also\nfound that in markets with a low volume of home sales, higher levels of CRA lending by banks is\nassociated with higher, not lower, lending by nonbanks, the opposite of crowding-out. It is possible that\nthe higher volume of CRA lending allows other lenders to better judge the credit risk of neighborhoods in\n\n17\n\nDing and Nakamura (2017) examine lending patterns in the wake of 2004 revisions to the Philadelphia MSA and\nfind that banks supply more credit in low- and moderate-income census tracts where they receive CRA credit than in\nthose areas where they no longer receive CRA credit as a result of the boundary change. Ringo (2017) finds similar\nresults looking at all boundary changes to MSAs in 2014.\n\n18\n\nSee Bhutta (2011).\n\n19\n\nSee Silver (2018).\n\n\f9\nwhich the overall volume of home sales is low. Similarly, CRA lending may pay a future dividend to all\nlenders to the extent that CRA lending in low- and moderate-income communities allows people and\nbusinesses to develop their credit histories, which can then be used by all lenders to make more informed\nunderwriting decisions on loans to these borrowers in the future. 20\n\nFinally, one might ask whether the increased investment under the CRA is spurring banks to take on\nriskier loans, which, depending on the degree of risk, might not be a positive. One study did find higher\napproval rates on mortgage applications in the 1-1/2 year window around banks’ CRA exams and\nelevated delinquency rates on these mortgages, but the estimated effects were moderate.21 Another study\nfound that while the CRA causes a substantial increase in mortgage lending to low-income borrowers, it\ndoes not appear to increase the risk of default on those loans. 22\n\nSo, in my view, the body of evidence suggests that the CRA has had a positive effect on credit availability\nin low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, thereby supporting economic development in these areas. 23\nHowever, just as technological change, the entry of new types of lenders, industry consolidation, and new\ntechniques for delivering credit and other financial services are all affecting banking, they are also\naffecting the regulations and how the regulators should go about assessing compliance with the CRA.\n\nThe CRA Will Be Modernized to Enhance Its Effectiveness\nTo ensure that regulations continue to promote the goals for which they were intended, the federal\nregulatory agencies undertake periodic reviews and offer guidance to bankers in how they assess\n\n20\n\nSee Bhutta (2011).\n\n21\n\nSee Agarwal, et al. (2012).\n\n22\n\nSee Ringo (2017).\n\n23\n\nNot everyone shares this view. See, e.g., Yezer (2017).\n\n\f10\ncompliance. 24 While regulators have offered moderate updates and guidance on the CRA over time, the\nlast time there were substantial revisions to the framework for assessing CRA compliance was in 1995,\nover 20 years ago.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury completed a review of the CRA, engaging with a\nwide variety of stakeholders. The Treasury made some recommendations about how the CRA is\nadministered in order to help ensure that a bank’s CRA activities meet the needs of the communities it\nserves in a safe and sound manner. 25 The OCC, a part of Treasury, has put out an advance notice of\nproposed rule-making (ANPR) seeking comment on ways to modernize the CRA regulations. 26 The\nFederal Reserve is also undertaking efforts aimed at ensuring that the CRA regulations continue to meet\nthe goals of the legislation amid the evolving financial services environment. 27 The legislation is and will\nremain an important piece of the toolkit for ensuring that all communities have fair access to credit.\n\nAssessment areas\nAn important area of focus is the area over which a bank’s CRA compliance is assessed by the banking\nagencies. I say “important” because, as I’ve just discussed, CRA activity is higher in areas covered by\nCRA examinations. So getting the assessment area right will influence the CRA’s effectiveness in getting\nbanking services to low- and moderate-income areas.\n\nCurrently, the regulations largely use the location of branches and deposit-taking ATMs to determine\nassessment areas. This made sense when the CRA originally became law because these were the main\nways that banks delivered services to the markets in which they operated. Now, with interstate banking\n24\n\nFor an example of this with respect to the CRA, see Interagency (2016).\n\n25\n\nSee U.S. Department of the Treasury (2018).\n\n26\n\nSee Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2018).\n\n27\n\nSee Brainard (2018a and 2018b).\n\n\f11\npermitted and technological innovations like the internet, banks can serve communities in which they\ndon’t necessarily have a branch or ATM, and lending and investment officers can forge relationships at a\nlonger distance than they could before. Indeed, online banks offer services nationwide from one location.\nAssessing their CRA compliance based on this single location, as is currently done, seems inappropriate.\n\nBut for those banks using the traditional model, data and research suggest that branches remain very\nrelevant and the presence of a branch helps ensure that communities receive better banking services.\nDespite a drop in the number of bank branches during the Great Recession, the number of branches per\ncapita is higher now than it was two decades ago, even in the wake of significant technological advances\nover that time period. 28 This suggests that bankers themselves see value in their branch networks.\n\nWhile the recent branch closures have not occurred disproportionately in low- and moderate-income\nareas, 29 these and rural areas are particularly susceptible to becoming so-called “banking deserts,” defined\nas no banks within 10 miles of populated areas. 30,31 People in low-income tracts are more than twice as\nlikely to live in a banking desert than those in higher-income tracts. 32 And census tracts in which a\nmajority of the population comprises minorities appear to be the most affected. 33 Branch closures do\nappear to have a serious impact on service in low-income areas. One study found that bank branch\nclosings in the 2000s led to a persistent decline of about 10 percent in local small-business lending, that\n\n28\n\nBased on the FDIC’s Historical Statistics on Banking and U.S. Census Bureau data on resident population, the\nnumber of branches of commercial banks per 10,000 people was 2.24 in 1997 and 2.43 in 2017. It peaked at 2.73 in\n2008.\n29\n\nMorgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang (2016).\n\n30\n\nSee Silver (2018) and National Community Reinvestment Coalition (2017).\n\n31\n\nYezer (2017) points out that the CRA may have inadvertently discouraged the establishment of branches,\nbecause physical offices tend to enlarge a bank’s assessment area and the requirement for more CRArelated activity.\n\n32\n\nMorgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang (2016).\n\n33\n\nSee Nguyen (forthcoming) and National Community Reinvestment Coalition (2017).\n\n\f12\nis, lending within 6 miles of the closed branch. 34 And this negative effect on lending was found to last up\nto 6 years. The author estimates that the decline in lending led to a sizable 2 percentage point reduction in\nlocal employment growth rates. Another study found that when the proportion of local bank branches\nbelonging to small banks versus large banks increases, there is an economically and statistically\nsignificant decline in the proportion of small businesses that feel financially constrained. 35 Results like\nthese point to the importance of continuing to focus on the community aspect of the CRA, even as the\ndefinition of assessment area is updated.\n\nAllowing flexibility but being consistent\nThis discussion of assessment areas points to another way the CRA can be modernized: namely,\nrecognizing that banks come in different sizes, serve areas with different needs, and use different business\nmodels. The focus should remain on making the CRA effective. This means tailoring the assessment\napproach for different kinds of banks and allowing them to meet their CRA obligations in a way that\nplays to their strengths while best servicing their communities, which can differ in terms of credit needs\nand opportunities. Clarifying and perhaps expanding the types of lending and services that qualify for\nCRA credit should also be considered. Incorporating incentives to lend, invest, and provide financial\nservices in areas with the greatest need should be a consideration in modernizing the CRA because, as I\npreviously mentioned, banks appear to respond to incentives in the CRA.\n\nAt the same time that they are allowing more flexibility, the rules and the federal banking agencies also\nneed to take a consistent approach, making sure that they set the same expectations and the same\nexamination and rating criteria. Focusing on outcomes rather than process will allow for flexibility and\n\n34\n\nSee Nguyen (forthcoming).\n\n35\n\nBerger, Bouwman, and Kim (2017).\n\n\f13\nconsistency, and can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRA regulatory framework.\nProviding better clarity and consistency can yield better CRA outcomes.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, community banks have earned a high degree of public trust even as faith in other institutions\nhas fallen. But the banking environment is rapidly evolving. Changes in technology and business\ndelivery models, new entrants, and increased competition all present challenges for both community\nbanks and their regulators. But they also provide opportunities. Community banks are a vital source of\nfinancial services in local communities and will remain so as they adapt to the changing environment.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act has been an important piece of legislation, helping to ensure that all\ncommunities have access to credit, investment, and other banking services, which are so vital to economic\ndevelopment. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators are seizing the opportunity to\nupdate the CRA’s regulatory framework so that it remains effective in a changing banking environment.\nIn this effort, the Fed plans to continue its engagement with bankers and other external stakeholders to\ncollect their views. Modernization efforts will also need to be informed by research and practice. I am\nlooking forward to the discussions we’ll be having over the next two days as we discuss the future of\ncommunity banking and its regulation.\n\n\f14\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Daniel Hartley, and Bhashkar Mazumder, “The Effects of the 1930s HOLC ‘Redlining\nMaps’,” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Working Paper No. 2017-12, revised August 2018.\n(https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-12-pdf.pdf)\nAgarwal, Sumit, Efraim Benmelech, Nittai Bergman, and Amit Seru, “Did the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA) Lead to Risky Lending?” National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Working Paper No.\n18609, December 2012.\n(http://www.nber.org/papers/w18609)\nBerger, Allen N., Christa H.S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nThird Annual ECB Macroprudential Policy and Research Conference\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMay 18, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the European Central Bank for inviting me to participate in this conference on macroprudential\npolicy and research. The work being undertaken at the ECB, other central banks, and universities has\nincreased our knowledge and understanding about the interlinkages between the macroeconomy and\nfinancial systems. It has been nine years since the financial crisis, and the global economy has improved\nsubstantially over that time. In the U.S., the economy is near both of our monetary policy goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability, and the outlook is one of the most favorable we have seen in a\nlong time. As we move further from the crisis, one lesson can never be lost: the importance of\nmaintaining a resilient financial system for a healthy economy. Today, I’ll spend my time discussing\nmonetary policy and macroprudential policy from the practical perspective of a U.S. monetary\npolicymaker. Research informs our policy decisions, but at the end of the day, decisions have to be made\nin a world that doesn’t match our models and without full information. Research can be elegant, practice\nrarely is, but when we are setting policy, effectiveness is what we strive for. Before I continue, I should\nnote that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nU.S. Financial System Regulation and Macroprudential Tools\nIt is an understatement to say that the U.S. financial system’s regulatory structure is complex. A wide\nvariety of institutions offer financial services in the U.S. Banks, a category that includes commercial\nbanks, savings and loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the nation. Other\nproviders include insurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises,\nincluding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other nonbanks,\nincluding broker-dealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\n1\n\nSee Fischer (2014).\n\n\f2\nAt the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit\nUnion Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance\nAgency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases, the regulatory\nauthority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by financial instrument.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which\ncontributed to a build-up in financial imbalances and systemic risk. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law\nin 2010, established provisions aimed at reducing the probability of another financial crisis and reducing\nthe costs on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. It directed the regulatory\nagencies to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which focused on the safety and\nsoundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach, which encouraged assessing the\nrisk across institutions. Dodd-Frank also created a new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council\n(FSOC), to promote coordination and information sharing across the financial system regulators. An\nimportant power of the FSOC is its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing\nthem under more banking-type supervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System has the responsibility for supervising systemically important financial institutions,\nincluding these FSOC-designated nonbank financial companies, large bank holding companies, and the\nU.S. operations of certain foreign banking organizations.\n\nThis complex system of institutions and regulators complicates risk monitoring and the ability to tailor\nregulations and supervisory oversight to potential risks to the financial system. But there are ongoing\nefforts in the U.S. to do so, and the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically\ntracking financial stability risks. Before I describe the framework, let me spend a few minutes on why the\n\n\f3\nFOMC regularly reviews financial stability, even though financial stability is not an explicit part of the\nFOMC’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nFinancial stability matters to the FOMC for several reasons. First, monetary policy affects the real\neconomy by affecting financial conditions. When financial markets are disrupted, as they were during the\nfinancial crisis, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can also be disrupted. Second, the\ngoals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected. Indeed, the FOMC’s statement on its\nmonetary policy strategy says that the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions “reflect its longer-run goals, its\nmedium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system\nthat could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”2 Financial stability is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for macroeconomic stability. On the other side of the coin, macroeconomic stability\nis an important contributor to financial stability, and well-formulated and well-communicated monetary\npolicy supports financial stability.\n\nA third reason monetary policymakers need to consider financial stability is that the financial crisis\nchanged how monetary policy is implemented. From a practical standpoint, monetary policymakers have\nto be more attuned to developments in financial markets and institutions than they once were. The actions\ntaken to address the financial crisis and Great Recession increased the size and changed the composition\nof the Fed’s balance sheet. The Fed is now transacting with a broader set of financial institutions, so\npolicymakers have to have a more complete understanding of the plumbing in financial markets.\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC (2018).\n\n\f4\nThe Fed’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks recognizes the\ncomplex nature of the financial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based and market-based finance\nand its multiplicity of regulatory and supervisory bodies.3 The framework tracks a standard set of\nfinancial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate shocks. It monitors these vulnerabilities\nusing a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures\n(reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity\ntransformation, and interconnectedness and complexity.4 Some of these vulnerabilities, like leverage,\nvary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity, are more structural in nature,\nreflecting the design of markets and intermediaries. The vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of\nthe economy: the banking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and\nshadow banks; the nonfinancial business sector; and the household sector. Tools like heat maps and datavisualization techniques aid in tracking changes in vulnerabilities over time.5 Assessments of individual\nvulnerabilities are then combined to get an assessment of the overall vulnerability of the U.S. financial\nsystem. Recognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the Fed staff has also developed\ntools to assess foreign financial stability.6\n\nFour times a year, the staff uses this framework to brief the FOMC, and an evaluation of developments\nrelated to financial stability is now a regular section in the Board of Governors’ monetary policy report to\nCongress.7\n\n3\n\nSee Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015).\n\n4\n\nImportant research on the propagation and amplification of shocks throughout the financial system includes\nKiyotaki and Moore (1997), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), and Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).\n5\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n6\n\nFor example, see FOMC (2017), page 5.\n\n7\n\nSee Board of Governors (2018a).\n\n\f5\nMacroprudential Policy and Monetary Policy\nAlthough the FOMC regularly discusses financial system stability, the financial system regulators,\nincluding the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (a group that is distinct from the FOMC), have\nresponsibility for maintaining and enhancing the structural resilience of the financial system. In the U.S.,\nstructural resilience is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital (including a minimum\nnon-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards); conducting stress tests; imposing\nliquidity standards; developing effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and\nnonbank financial institutions; requiring large banks to submit living will resolution plans; and\nimplementing reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets.8 Financial regulators are also\nfocused on working with the industry to enhance strategies to improve the cyber resiliency of the financial\nsector, as cybersecurity risk is a continuing threat to financial stability.\n\nIn contrast to the structural tools, compared to other countries, the U.S. has fewer countercyclical tools\nthat can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However, the stress\ntests can be used as a countercyclical tool to the extent that the vulnerabilities of concern can be built into\nthe stress scenarios. For example, this year’s adverse stress scenario includes deep declines in corporate\nbond and real estate prices.9 Another cyclical tool available in the U.S. is the countercyclical capital\nbuffer (CCyB), which can be imposed on internationally active banks. The Federal Reserve Board has\nindicated that it will use this tool only when systemic vulnerabilities are “meaningfully above normal”\nand that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the buffer gradually.10 The Board anticipates giving\n\n8\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission implemented revisions to the regulations governing money market\nmutual funds in 2014 and 2016 to reduce the chance of investor runs on these funds. In 2009, the G20 countries\nagreed that standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts should be cleared by central counterparties. There\nare limits to interday credit exposures in the tri-party repo market.\n9\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018b).\n\n10\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016). Other countries have used limits on loan-to-value\nratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary over the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or\nhousehold credit to control leverage. See Liang (2013) and Fischer (2014).\n\n\f6\nbanking organizations 12 months before an increase would become effective.11 The U.S. has not had\nmuch experience with this tool. It has yet to set a positive countercyclical capital buffer, even though\ncountercyclical policy calls for building up buffers during good times so that they are available during bad\ntimes. And the lead times needed to use this tool likely make it less effective at addressing vulnerabilities\nthat may rapidly develop or may be detected only after they have had time to develop. So focusing on\nincreasing the resiliency of the financial system’s structure across the business and financial cycles seems\nwell-founded. And from a practical viewpoint, even if, in theory, using countercyclical tools might be\npreferred, their limits suggest we need to at least contemplate using monetary policy to address financial\nstability in some cases.\n\nIndeed, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated in a tabletop exercise in which I\nparticipated with some other Federal Reserve Bank presidents.12 The exercise involved a hypothetical\nscenario in which commercial real estate prices were rising sharply but the economy was at full\nemployment and inflation was somewhat below goal. The objective of the exercise was for policymakers\nto use available macroprudential tools and possibly monetary policy to reduce the risk posed to financial\nstability by the commercial real estate boom while fostering the Fed’s monetary policy goals.\nImplementation challenges included having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in some cases, to\nfollow legally required administrative procedures like public comment periods, which delay application\nof the tools. Such delays could make the tools ineffective or even cause them to exacerbate the situation\nrather than shore up the financial system. Another limitation was that some tools applied only to\nregulated banking firms, which could result in risks shifting to other parts of the financial system. I came\naway from the exercise more convinced of the need to focus on the structural resilience of the financial\nsystem across the business and financial cycles.\n\n11\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017).\n\n12\n\nSee Adrian, et al. (2015).\n\n\f7\n\nWhether monetary policy should be used to address financial stability risks, such as sharply rising credit\ngrowth, is still an open question.13 The benefits depend on the extent to which monetary policy would be\neffective at stemming financial imbalances, thereby lowering the probability of a financial crisis or\nlimiting the effects of the crisis, and whether or not there are macroprudential tools that could be used\ninstead. Any benefits of attempting to use monetary policy to stem financial imbalances would need to be\nweighed against the cost of slowing the economy and increasing the volatility of output and of inflation.14\n\nLet me now turn to the practical question of how the decisions about financial stability policy and\nmonetary policy might effectively be organized, and then end with some conclusions.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\nI argued earlier that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability policy are complementary over\nthe longer run. But the policies do interact, and at times, there can be short-run trade-offs between\nmonetary policy actions taken to support macroeconomic stability and financial stability. For example, an\nextended period of very low interest rates aimed at returning the macroeconomy to health might also\ngenerate financial imbalances and pose potential risks to financial stability by spurring investors to search\nfor yield. Or a tightening of macroprudential policy to address financial stability risks could result in\ntighter financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy\nresponse would be needed to promote macroeconomic stability.\n13\n\nBorio, et al. (2018) argue that monetary policy should be more attentive to the financial cycle. Svensson (2017)\nargues against “leaning against the wind.” International Monetary Fund (2015) and Smets (2014) review the\nliterature on the use of monetary policy for financial stability.\n14\n\nAn interesting paper by Gourio, Kashyap, and Sim (2017) shows that the cost-benefit analysis depends on the\nnature of the shocks hitting the economy and the severity of the financial crisis. In the case of only demand and\nproductivity shocks, having monetary policy focus only on macroeconomic stability also limits the probability of a\nfinancial crisis. But when there are financial shocks and when a financial crisis would have a large negative impact\non the economy, using monetary policy to limit credit growth would increase welfare, even though it would mean\nhigher volatility of output and inflation.\n\n\f8\n\nIn many countries, responsibility for monetary policy and responsibility for financial stability policy are\nhandled by two different committees, which, in some cases, have some members in common.15 Canada’s\nfinancial sector regulator is not part of the central bank, but the Bank of Canada assesses financial system\nvulnerabilities and risks and publishes this assessment twice a year.16 In Sweden, the financial stability\nauthority is not part of the central bank, but the central bank publishes a financial stability report and its\ngovernor sits on the financial stability council, an advisory board. The ECB is somewhat different, with\nresponsibility for both monetary policy and macroprudential policy ultimately resting with the ECB\nGoverning Council.\n\nThe U.K. has a two-committee structure housed within the Bank of England. The monetary policy and\nfinancial policy committees are independent, but they also share members, which allows for good\ncommunication and information sharing between the two committees. One example of coordination came\nin August 2013 when the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee initiated forward guidance that\nit would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at least until the unemployment\nrate had fallen to 7 percent.17 But it also said that a condition that would vacate this guidance would be if\nthe Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee found that the stance of monetary policy was\nthreatening financial stability in a way that couldn’t be contained by the available macroprudential tools.\n\nIn the U.S., financial system complexity means that we don’t have a single authority that oversees\nfinancial stability. While the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has the ability to designate\nfirms as systemically important financial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the\n\n15\n\nKohn (2015) discusses the benefits of what he calls this two-committee approach.\n\n16\n\nSee Bank of Canada (2017).\n\n17\n\nKohn (2014) discusses this example, and see Bank of England (2013).\n\n\f9\nFed, the FSOC does not have the authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can\nmake recommendations to the regulatory agencies and to Congress, which can then decide to act or not.18\n\nBut all is not lost. With its oversight of systemically important financial institutions, the Board of\nGovernors plays an important role in setting macroprudential policy in the U.S. The Board also\nconstitutes part of the FOMC, so that there is a potential for some coordination between macroprudential\npolicy and monetary policy or, at the very least, good communication and information sharing. In some\nsense, the U.S. has a two-committee set-up and one could imagine a relationship between the FOMC and\nthe Board of Governors similar to that between the two policy committees in the U.K.\n\nIn the U.S., housing both committees within the central bank has an important governance benefit. By\ndesign, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions are independent from short-run political considerations,\nwith appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public. Similarly, it is also important that\npolicymakers have some independence in setting macroprudential policy.19 There will be times when\ntools have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability. This might be difficult to explain,\nand there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be invoked in seemingly good times.\nThis means that macroprudential policymakers should be communicating with the public to improve the\npublic’s understanding of how financial stability risks are being monitored, what tools are available to\npromote financial resilience, and the rationale for macroprudential policy decisions. Systematic and\ntransparent application of financial stability policy would seem to be as important as it is in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Still, we are a distance away from being able to articulate a clear strategy and a set of\nprinciples to guide decisions about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a\ntool for financial stability and when we should rely upon macroprudential tools.\n18\n19\n\nKohn (2014) compares and contrasts the financial stability structure in the U.S. with that in the U.K.\n\nKohn (2014) discusses the importance of the financial stability authority being able to pursue its goals\nindependent of short-run political considerations even when the actions taken aren’t popular.\n\n\f10\n\nConclusions\nLet me conclude with three points I take away from this practical viewpoint on financial resilience and\nmonetary policy in the U.S.\n\nFirst, given some of the limitations on macroprudential tools and the complexity of financial system\nregulation, ensuring the structural resilience of the financial system throughout the cycle is the first line of\ndefense in promoting financial stability. Higher levels and quality of capital, liquidity standards, stress\ntests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial\ninstitutions are all important tools for improving resilience. In my view, we should set standards for the\nstructural resilience tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more experience with and\nconfidence in the countercyclical tools. I support efforts to better align regulation and supervisory\noversight with where the potential system risks lie, including proposals to make regulation less\nburdensome on community banks in the U.S. However, I think it would be a mistake to unwind the steps\ntaken since the financial crisis that have led to a more resilient financial system. I would like to see how\nthe new settings perform throughout the cycle before making major changes.\n\nSecond, monetary policymakers need to monitor the resiliency of the financial system and be cognizant of\nthe interlinkages between monetary policy, financial imbalances, and financial stability risks. In a\nsituation of rising financial stability risks, while using macroprudential tools might be preferred, we have\nhad little experience with these tools. If they proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks\ncontinued to grow, monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. Note that, in this case,\nthe blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the\nrisks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals\nwould also be in jeopardy over the medium run.\n\n\f11\nThird, it will be important for the FOMC and Board of Governors to make progress toward a systematic\nstrategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, including the\nappropriate use of monetary policy to counteract financial imbalances, and to communicate this strategy\nto the public. There are two concrete steps the Federal Reserve can take now. The Fed can continue to\nhold tabletop exercises designed to illuminate the interactions between macroprudential policy and\nmonetary policy. These scenario exercises can help clarify policymakers’ views on the appropriate use of\neach type of policy and help the Federal Reserve develop a systematic strategy for dealing with the\ninteractions between the policies. In addition, similar to other central banks, the Fed can develop and\npublish a financial stability report, which discusses the Fed’s assessment of financial system\nvulnerabilities. This report could also provide more context for the Board’s decisions about the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and any regulatory guidance aimed at mitigating emerging risks.\n\nIn summary, I believe the steps taken since the financial crisis have made the financial system more\nresilient. Today, systemically important financial institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers\nand better risk-management systems. However, we cannot take greater resiliency for granted. If, as many\neconomists predict, the new normal is a world with lower equilibrium interest rates, then the interactions\nbetween monetary policy and financial stability are likely to remain center stage. It’s important that we\ncome to some clarity about how we will use all of our policy tools to promote a healthy macroeconomy\nand resilient financial system.\n\n\f12\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macroprudential Policy: Case\nStudy from a Tabletop Exercise,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper RPA 15-1, September\n30, 2015, revised December 2015.\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/risk-and-policy-analysis/2015/macroprudential-policy-casestudy-from-a-tabletop-exercise.aspx)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Annual Review of\nFinancial Economics, 7, December 2015, pp. 357-395.\n(http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-financial-111914-042008)\nAikman, David, Michael T.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nGlobal Interdependence Center Central Banking Series with Banque de France\nParis, France\nMay 14, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking the Global Interdependence Center and the Banque de France for inviting me\nback to this important conference series. I always learn a lot from the GIC’s Central Banking Series\nconferences, and I am proud of the association I have had with the GIC for many years.\n\nThree years ago when I spoke here, I reviewed the tools that monetary policymakers had put in place to\naddress the financial crisis and Great Recession. I discussed the Federal Reserve’s plans for normalizing\npolicy and some of the challenges we would face as we transitioned from extraordinary economic and\npolicy times back to ordinary times. Today, the environment has changed, but policymakers, as always,\ncontinue to face challenges in determining the most effective policies within the environment. So today,\nI’d like to carry on the theme and talk about current and future issues that Fed policymakers will face as\nwe set appropriate monetary policy. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary\npolicymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\nThe U.S. economy is performing very well and I expect that to continue. Over this year and next, I expect\nabove-trend output growth, continued strength in labor markets, and firming inflation. I believe the U.S.\neconomy is slightly beyond maximum employment, from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions\nmonetary policy can address, and that inflation will reach our symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustainable\nbasis over the next one to two years. This outlook is based on favorable underlying fundamentals,\nincluding accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal\nincome, a global economy that is improving overall, and stable inflation expectations.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there are risks around the outlook. Financial market volatility has risen\nfrom the very low levels of recent years. But, so far, investors seem to be taking it in stride and firms tell\n\n\f2\nus the volatility has not thwarted their spending plans. The rise in oil prices and increase in the value of\nthe dollar are worth watching. Geopolitical risks have risen and there is uncertainty around trade, which\nmay not be resolved soon. Assessing the impact of trade developments on the U.S. macroeconomy will\nultimately depend on the actions actually taken by the U.S. and its trading partners. But in the meantime,\ncontinued uncertainty may also cause businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and alter their spending in the near term. We will need to continue to monitor the trade\nsituation. On the upside, the tax package and increased federal spending in the U.S. are expected to add\nto an already healthy level of spending in the second half of this year and next year, but the magnitudes\nand exact timing are still somewhat uncertain.\n\nDespite the risks, this is one of the most favorable outlooks we have had in a long time, so one might ask:\nWhat are the challenges? The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy\noutlook to meet and maintain our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. At its\nmeeting earlier this month, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This was consistent with the strategy the FOMC has followed as progress has\nbeen made on our monetary policy goals, namely, to gradually remove the high level of accommodation\nthat was needed to address the Great Recession. Also, at the May meeting, the FOMC continued to\nimplement its plan, initiated last October, to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.1 The balance sheet grew in size and lengthened in maturity during the Great\nRecession when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets in order to put further\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates.2 We are now allowing maturing longer-term assets to\n\n1\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n2\n\nAs a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6 percent\nof nominal GDP, to about $4.4 trillion today, or 22 percent of nominal GDP. The balance sheet’s composition\nchanged from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\n\f3\nroll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this process will take several years to\ncomplete.\n\nThe economy is dynamic, so calibrating monetary policy to the medium-run outlook involves several\nmoving parts. Essentially, the challenge for policymakers is to assess current and future performance on\nour policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, and to assess the current and appropriate\nfuture stance of monetary policy. So let me discuss each of these.\n\nMaximum Employment\nThe U.S. labor market is strong. The unemployment rate, at 3.9 percent, is below its lowest point during\nthe last expansion and near its lowest point in the past 40 years. I expect the unemployment rate to fall\nfurther this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. This year, payroll job growth has strengthened\nto an average of 200,000 jobs per month. This is well above most economists’ estimates of trend job\ngrowth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The trend estimate depends on what\none assumes about labor force participation, and this is a key factor in determining whether the economy\nis at or beyond the level of employment that is sustainable over the longer run.\n\nBased on demographic factors, including the aging of the U.S. population, the longer-run trend in\nparticipation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation rate has been fairly stable over the\npast two years, a sign of strength in the labor market. We are increasingly hearing from a wide variety of\nbusinesses and job placement firms that it is hard to find workers, for both higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations, and firms are responding to labor shortages by raising wages. The acceleration in the\nemployment cost index over the past two years suggests that the anecdotal reports of firms raising wages\nto attract and retain workers are now filtering through to the official statistics.\n\n\f4\nAn issue for policymakers is that it is difficult to know with precision how tight labor markets are. The\nacceleration in compensation growth, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-3/4 percent\nmore recently, is not as strong as one might normally expect from tight labor markets. In my view, part\nof the reason for this is the low level of productivity growth over the expansion. Over the longer run,\nwages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this expansion,\nlabor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent.3 This is less than half the pace over the\nprior two expansions. Research from the Cleveland Fed staff suggests that nominal wage growth over the\nexpansion is not a puzzle if you account for productivity growth, labor market conditions, and inflation.4\n\nNonetheless, economists and policymakers have to take on board all the data when assessing where the\neconomy is relative to goal. The movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that\nwage and price inflation have remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened, suggest that\nlabor market conditions may not be as tight as we originally assumed. As the expansion has played out,\nFOMC policymakers have lowered their estimates of the longer-run level of unemployment; these\nestimates come with a considerable amount of uncertainty. Five years ago, in the March 2013 Summary\nof Economic Projections, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate ranged\nfrom 5.2 to 6.0 percent.5 In projections this March, the central tendency was 4.3 to 4.7 percent, down a\n\n3\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n4\n\nSee Pinheiro, Roberto and Meifeng Yang, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017\n(https://clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-great-recession.aspx).\n5\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nMarch 19-20, 2013\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20130320.pdf).\n\n\f5\npercentage point or more, with a median projection of 4.5 percent.6 I have also moved down my own\nestimate of the longer-run unemployment rate over time, to 4.5 percent.\n\nDespite lower estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, in my view, if one combines all the\nindicators, labor markets do appear to be slightly beyond maximum employment, and the outlook\nsuggests that labor markets will continue to be tight over the next couple of years. In the past, when labor\nmarkets have moved too far beyond maximum employment, with the unemployment rate moving\nsubstantially below estimates of its longer-run level for some time, the economy overheated, inflation\nrose, and the economy ended up in a recession. Achieving a soft landing is difficult and recent research\nby Cleveland Fed staff suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to pull more people\nback into the workforce is unlikely to have a lasting effect on labor force participation.7 An interesting\npaper by economists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago suggests that overly tight labor\nmarkets can result in firms having to meet rising demand by hiring workers into jobs that are not the best\nmatch to their skill sets.8 The longer this need to hire lower-productivity workers continues, the larger the\ndecline in employment when the inevitable bad shock and downturn comes. All this suggests that\npolicymakers have to continue to assess labor market conditions, and to balance progress on this goal\nwith progress on our other objective, price stability.\n\n6\n\nSee the Summary of Economic Projections section of FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,”\nMarch 20-21, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180321.pdf).\n7\n\nFallick, Bruce, and Pawel Krolikowski, “Hysteresis in Employment among Disadvantaged Workers,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 18-01, February 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2018-working-papers/wp1801-hysteresis-in-employment-among-disadvantaged-workers.aspx).\n8\n\nJackson, Matthew O., and Pietro Tebaldi, “A Forest Fire Theory of the Duration of a Boom and the Size of a\nSubsequent Bust,” Working Paper, Stanford University and University of Chicago, June 2017\n(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2263501).\n\n\f6\nPrice Stability\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims\nfor inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that this rate is most consistent over the longer run with\nour statutory mandate. The goal is symmetric, meaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation\nwere running persistently above or persistently below this goal and such persistent deviations would\nwarrant a policy response.9\n\nInflation measures can vary from month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to\ntemporary economic and financial disturbances. So when we assess where inflation is relative to our\ngoal, it is important to look through transitory movements and focus on where inflation is going on a\nsustained basis. Our goal is expressed in terms of total PCE inflation, but policymakers also look at a\nvariety of other measures of inflation to get a sense of the underlying inflation trend. These include CPI\nmeasures; core measures of PCE and CPI, which exclude food and energy prices because they tend to be\nvolatile; and the trimmed-mean and median measures, which drop those components with the largest and\nsmallest changes. We also use various models to forecast inflation. The models include components to\naccount for current and past inflation, utilization rates of labor and capital, and inflation expectations. As\ngood as our various models are, it’s important to remember that a significant portion of the variation in\ninflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.10 So forecasts of inflation, like\nthose of longer-run unemployment, have wide error bands. For example, based on historical forecast\n\n9\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n10\n\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f7\nerrors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one to two\nyears ahead is around 1.0 percentage point.11\n\nInflation has been running under the 2 percent goal for much of the expansion, but it has been firming and\nis now near our goal. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation rose to 2.0 percent and core\nPCE inflation rose to 1.9 percent. These are welcome developments, but it is too soon to say that we have\nmet our inflation goal on a sustained basis. Near-term monthly readings of inflation have risen, but some\nof the pickup reflects higher commodity prices and some of the strength is likely to be temporary, as low\nreadings from last March drop out of the calculations.\n\nI expect to see month-to-month variation in the numbers around an underlying upward trend in inflation,\nas inflation moves to our goal on a sustainable basis over the next year or so. One of the challenges for\nmonetary policymakers will be to keep the public and market participants focused on the medium-run\noutlook for inflation, even as higher monthly readings in the near term are followed by some softer\nreadings. We don’t want inflation expectations to react to these temporary movements, and policymakers\ncan best avoid that by continuing to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are\ncommitted to achieving our dual mandate goals. Consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run monetary policy\nstrategy, I am comfortable looking through transitory movements in inflation – those to the low side and\nthose to the high side – as we aim for inflation over the longer run to be at our symmetric 2 percent\nobjective, allowing for the normal variation in measured inflation.\n\n11\n\nSee Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error Ranges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of\nthe “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” March 20-21, 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180321.pdf).\n\n\f8\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nAs the FOMC said in its May statement, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\nCurrently, one indicator that policy is accommodative is that the fed funds rate, adjusted for inflation, is\nnegative even though the economic outlook is strong. Another indicator is that many monetary policy\nrules are pointing to higher interest rates given the outlook. For example, the simple monetary policy\nrules across several forecasts that are available on the Cleveland Fed’s external website indicate that\npolicy rates should be rising given the forecasts, with the median path somewhat steeper in the near term\nthan the median funds rate path in the March Summary of Economic Projections.12\n\nIn its May statement, the FOMC also said it expects economic conditions will evolve in a manner that\nwill warrant further gradual increases in the fed funds rate. In my view, the medium-run outlook supports\nthe continued gradual removal of policy accommodation; it seems the best strategy for balancing the risks\nto both of our policy goals and avoiding a build-up of financial stability risks. We want to give inflation\ntime to move back to goal, and I don’t expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path.\nAt the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and financial conditions are\naccommodative. In my view, it is appropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy\naccommodation to ensure that we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if\nthe economy were allowed to overheat or a build-up of financial imbalances or risks to financial stability\nthat could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates. Of course, the path policy actually\ntakes will depend on how the economy actually evolves. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we\nmay need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower,\nbut the gradual upward path is consistent with the modal economic outlook at this time.\n\n12\n\nSee Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, “Simple Monetary Policy Rules”\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx).\n\n\f9\nAs we continue to move rates up, we will have to continue to assess whether monetary policy is\naccommodative, neutral, or restrictive. Essentially, it requires assessing where the policy rate is relative\nto the level of the short-term interest rate that represents neutral monetary policy, that is, the equilibrium\ninterest rate. This equilibrium interest rate will vary with economic conditions that affect the demand for\ninvestment and the supply of savings; there are wide error bands around estimates of this rate; and the rate\nover a short-run horizon can differ from that over a longer horizon. For example, as the economy\ndeteriorated during the financial crisis and Great Recession, the short-run equilibrium interest rate fell to a\nlevel below what would be expected to prevail over the longer run. Now, with fiscal policy turning from\nrestrictive to stimulative, the economy growing above trend, and investment rising, the short-term\nequilibrium interest rate is rising, too.\n\nAs the expansion continues, it could be that in order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move\nthe fed funds rate, for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the\nlonger run. Indeed, the March Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the median appropriate\npolicy path has the fed funds rate in 2020 moving a bit above the estimate of its longer-run level, which is\nabout 3 percent. Of course, 2020 is a long time away and the policy path actually followed will be\nresponsive to changes in the outlook.\n\nIn terms of that estimate of the longer-run fed funds rate, one needs to consider what policy rate is\nconsistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe\nthat this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering\ntheir estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median\nestimate was 4 percent. Now it is about 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is related to the longer-run\npotential growth rate of the economy, which itself depends on the growth of the labor force and the\ngrowth of productivity, a measure of how effectively the economy combines labor and capital to create\noutput.\n\n\f10\n\nBased on demographics, U.S. labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in\nrecent decades.13 While some of the slow growth in labor productivity during this expansion has been\ncyclical, more persistent structural factors may also be at play.14 The combination of slow labor force\ngrowth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential growth rate of the economy will be lower\nthan it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over the longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot\nslower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, and my own estimate of the longerrun nominal fed funds rate is 3 percent, or 1 percent in real terms.\n\nOf course, policy changes outside the realm of monetary policy could foster higher productivity growth\nand labor force growth and ultimately support higher potential output growth and equilibrium interest\nrates. But such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a\nsustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under\ncurrent policy, the U.S. federal deficit as a share of GDP will be considerably higher 10 years from now,\nwith rising government debt levels implying that a higher share of government spending will go to\n\n13\n\nIn the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered\nthe workforce. But since then, labor force growth has slowed, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over\n2010-2016, and it is expected to remain near that level over the next decade. For further discussion of demographics\nand economic growth, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,”\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November\n16, 2017, and forthcoming in the Cato Journal\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-their-implicationsfor-the-economy-and-policy.aspx).\n14\n\nFor example, on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3\npercent of total employment per year. Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent. For further discussion of\ndynamism, see Mester, Loretta J., “The National and Regional Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” The\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania Annual Business Luncheon, Pittsburgh, PA,\nNovember 30, 2016\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161130-the-national-and-regional-economicoutlook-and-monetary-policy).\n\n\f11\ninterest payments.15 This would tend to crowd out productive investments by the private sector and the\ngovernment, thereby lowering productivity and longer-run growth.\n\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: Operations and Strategy\nLet me conclude by touching on two future monetary policy considerations: the operating framework that\nthe FOMC uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level, and the\nmonetary policy framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy\nrate is.16\n\nBefore the financial crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves scarce. The FOMC could make\nsmall changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, and this allowed the FOMC to\nensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC’s target. But now, as a result of the Fed’s\nlarge-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks are holding a bit more than $2\ntrillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and almost all of this is in excess of what is required by\nregulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate.\nInstead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess\nreserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds\n\n15\n\nThe deficit as a percentage of GDP (adjusted to exclude the effects of shifting payments from one fiscal year into\nanother so that those payments are not made on a weekend) was 3.5 percent in 2017. Under the CBO’s baseline\nassumptions, the CBO projects that this ratio will rise to 4.2 percent this year and be 4.8 percent in 2028. See\nSummary Table 2 from CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,” Congress of the United States,\nApril 2018\n(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651).\n16\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks),\nand Mester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework).\n\n\f12\nrate. As normalization of the balance sheet progresses, the FOMC will need to decide which operating\nframework it will use going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial\ncrisis, and part of the consideration will be whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the\ngeneral level of short-run interest rates.17\n\nAnother issue for the FOMC is the strategic framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy.\nCurrently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in\neffectively promoting our policy goals. But as the economy moves back to normal, it seems an opportune\ntime for the FOMC to undertake a study of its framework. As a matter of good governance, a central\nbank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. Moreover, if the longer-term\nequilibrium real interest rate does remain lower than in past decades, there will be less room for monetary\npolicy to cushion against a negative economic shock, policy would likely hit the zero lower bound more\noften, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would have to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective or are constrained from being used, the potential is for longer recessions and\nlonger bouts of low inflation.\n\nGiven this potential scenario, now is the time to assess whether changes to our current framework could\nmake monetary policy more effective in achieving our goals. Researchers have suggested several\nalternative frameworks, such as targeting an inflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflationtargeting range instead of a point goal, or targeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather\nthan for inflation. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges, but the positives and\n\n17\n\nFor a review of changes in the fed funds market since the financial crisis, see Craig, Ben R. and Sara Millington,\n“The Federal Funds Market since the Financial Crisis,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary,\nApril 5, 2017\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economiccommentaries/ec-201707-the-federal-funds-market-since-the-financial-crisis.aspx).\n\n\f13\nnegatives should be thoroughly reviewed to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives\nwould outweigh those of the flexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use.\n\nConclusion\nThree years ago at this conference, I discussed the challenges U.S. monetary policymakers faced in\npreparing for the start of monetary policy normalization. Today, the medium-run outlook for the U.S.\neconomy is very favorable and policy normalization is well underway. While the economic environment\nhas changed, monetary policy challenges remain. I appreciate the opportunity this conference has given\nme to explain how I’m approaching some of the policy issues the FOMC faces. I look forward to your\nquestions.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business and Deloitte LLP\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nApril 19, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nLet me begin by thanking Dean Arjang Assad of the Katz Graduate School of Business and Dmitri Shiry\nof Deloitte for inviting me to speak with you this evening. Dmitri performs important public service as a\nmember of the board of directors of the Cleveland Fed’s Pittsburgh Branch, and it just so happens that\nthis building formerly housed our branch. In addition to including the western part of Pennsylvania, the\nCleveland Fed’s District comprises the state of Ohio and parts of Kentucky and West Virginia. The\nregional nature of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows\nmonetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people and\nhelps ensure that those decisions incorporate information from all parts of the country, not just\nWashington, D.C. or Wall Street.\n\nThis evening, I would like to give you my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. My\nremarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nSome Context: The Medium-Run Outlook and Monetary Policy\nLet me start with some context. Monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. Some sectors are more\nsensitive to interest rates than others, so it takes some time for changes in monetary policy to be\ntransmitted through all parts of the economy. This means monetary policymakers have to formulate an\noutlook for the economy over the medium run and evaluate the risks around that outlook in order to set\nappropriate policy.\n\nAlthough we use state-of-the-art techniques and incorporate official data and anecdotal information from\nour contacts across the country, there is still a lot of uncertainty around any economic forecast. Indeed, in\nspeaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said, “The only economic forecast in\n\n\f2\nwhich I have complete confidence is that the economy will not evolve along the precise path implied by\nour projections.” 1\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we’d like does not mean that the\nexercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting and assessing risks over the medium run helps us\navoid focusing too much on short-run changes in the economic data or volatility in financial markets. It\nhelps us be systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions to the extent that they change\nthe outlook. And the more that people understand this process, the more they’ll be able to anticipate\nwhere policy is likely to go even if the economy develops in unexpected ways.\n\nWith that as background, let me turn to the outlook.\n\nThe Economy\nI expect 2018 to be another good year for the economy, with above-trend growth, continued labor market\nstrength, and firming inflation. The economy will be supported by favorable fundamentals, including\naccommodative monetary and fiscal policy, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal income,\nand an improving global economy. Nonetheless, financial market volatility has risen from the very low\nlevels of recent years, the trade picture has created uncertainty, and geopolitical concerns have risen. I\nview these as risks to the outlook, but at this point, these factors have not caused me to change my\noutlook for the overall economy. The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this\nhealthy economy to sustain the expansion. Monetary policy is still accommodative, and as the economy\nstrengthens, we don’t want to get behind the curve and find ourselves in a position of having to raise rates\n\n1\n\nSee Bernanke, Ben S., “Federal Reserve Communications,” Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2007.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm)\n\n\f3\nmore aggressively than anticipated. But we also don’t want to overreact to the positive outlook by raising\nrates too aggressively and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing.\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to around 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth this year to be a bit\nstronger. Admittedly, incoming data suggest a moderation in consumer and business spending in the first\nquarter. But this moderation was from high levels, and I expect the first-quarter softness in output growth\nto be temporary, just as it was in the past couple of years.\n\nLast year, growth became more balanced across sectors and less dependent on only the consumer.\nNonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent in 2017, a significant pickup from the anemic\npace of less than 1 percent in the prior two years. That earlier weakness reflected the steep decline in oil\nprices between mid-2014 and early 2016, which caused a sharp pullback in drilling, mining, and their\nsuppliers. The oil price decline was accompanied by a sharp appreciation of the dollar, which hurt\nmanufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. But last year, oil prices rose, the dollar depreciated,\nand the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen, all of which supported increased business\nspending.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up. This should be\na positive for U.S. exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rhetoric suggesting an\nescalation of reciprocal tariffs on certain goods traded between the U.S. and China, and the ongoing\nrenegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have clouded the trade picture.\nThis cloud may not pass over quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately\ndepend on the actions taken by the U.S. and its trading partners with respect to trade, and whether those\nactions or the continuing uncertainty causes businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the\nU.S. economy.\n\n\f4\nWe have already seen a marked increase in volatility in the equity markets this year. However, it is\nhelpful to put this volatility into perspective. Last year, the S&P 500 index rose 19 percent, amid\nextremely low volatility. Equity prices are little changed, on net, this year. More notable is the rise in\nvolatility. We are less than four months into the year, but as of yesterday’s close, there have already been\n29 days on which the S&P 500 rose or fell by more than 1 percent. Through all of last year, there were\nonly eight such days – a very low number compared to the average of about 60 days per year from 2010\nthrough 2016.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. The increased\nvolatility this year has not been associated with signs of financial market stress, such as disorderly\ntrading, a lack of liquidity, or contagion to other markets. And while a deeper and more persistent drop in\nequity markets could lead to a pullback in risk-taking and spending, the movements we have seen thus far\nare not close to this scenario. Contacts tell us higher volatility has not deterred planned spending. Equity\nprices remain considerably above their levels at the start of last year, and both business and consumer\nsentiment remain at high levels.\n\nThe changes in tax policy are expected to buoy both business and household spending this year. Lower\ntax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business\nspending to meet higher near-term demand, some of which will be driven by higher federal spending. In\na recent Cleveland Fed staff survey of firms in the District, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings\nthis year said they planned to use some of the proceeds to increase investment.\n\nThe tax package adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending. Personal\nincomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower personal tax rates and higher\nstandard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the aggregate, although the\nimpact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income.\n\n\f5\nHousehold balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of\ndeleveraging and increased savings.\n\nThe strength in the household sector is also supporting a moderately paced expansion of the housing\nsector, despite the increase in mortgage rates. In the aggregate, housing equity held by households is now\nabove its peak before the housing crash. While the new tax law contains several provisions that affect the\ntax treatment of homeownership, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a\nsustainable pace.\n\nLabor markets\nThe economy’s strength is well illustrated by the very strong conditions in labor markets. I expect that\nstrength to continue. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is below its lowest point during the last\nexpansion. It is under the 4-1/2 percent rate I gauge to be consistent with full employment over the longer\nrun. I expect the unemployment rate to move below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent\nnext year.\n\nOver the first three months of the year, payroll jobs have grown by an average of about 200,000 per\nmonth. This is a pickup from last year’s average monthly gain of about 180,000 jobs and is well above\nmost economists’ estimates of trend monthly job growth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000.\nBased on demographic factors, including the aging of the population, the longer-run trend in labor force\nparticipation is downward sloping, but participation has been fairly stable over the past two years, another\nsign of a strong labor market.\n\nRegional contacts continue to report that finding workers, both for higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations, is very difficult, and that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages\nand benefits and more flexible work schedules. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth\n\n\f6\nhas moved up, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. That’s\nless of a pickup than what is typically seen given the tightness in labor markets, but it is consistent with\nthe low productivity growth we’ve seen over the expansion. 2 As investment continues to pick up, which\nshould help to promote productivity growth, and firms continue to move wages up to attract and retain\nworkers, I expect to see some strengthening in wage growth.\n\nCombining all the indicators, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions\nmonetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond maximum employment, one part of the Fed’s\nmonetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims for inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that\nthis rate is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate. Inflation measures can vary\nfrom month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial\ndisturbances. So to assess where we are relative to goal, it’s always a good idea to look through transitory\nmovements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is\ngoing on a sustained basis.\n\nGetting inflation back to 2 percent has been somewhat of a challenge, but since 2015, inflation has been\ngenerally moving up. At 1.8 percent, PCE inflation is near, but still slightly under, our goal. In the near\nterm, we will likely see some higher inflation readings as last March’s sharp decline in the prices of cell\n\n2\n\nOver the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\nexpansion, growth in labor productivity, as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has\nbeen on the order of only 1 percent, less than half the pace over the prior two expansions.\n\n\f7\nphone data plans drop out of the year-over-year measures, but we need to remain focused on the mediumrun outlook for inflation.\n\nWith growth above trend, strong labor demand, and inflation expectations relatively stable, my outlook is\nthat inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. I\ndon’t expect inflation to move up sharply. But as inflation firms, it is important that monetary\npolicymakers continue to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are committed to\nachieving our dual mandate goals. Before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the Pittsburgh\neconomy.\n\nThe Pittsburgh economy\nThe path of the expansion in the Pittsburgh region reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks\nthat have hit the broader U.S. economy. Pittsburgh saw relatively strong employment growth early in the\nexpansion. But by mid-2012, payroll growth had begun to weaken. The pullback in mining, drilling, and\nmanufacturing in 2015 and 2016 had a significant effect on the Pittsburgh region. The region lost jobs in\n2015, barely saw any job growth in 2016, and the unemployment rate moved up. But last year saw a\nsignificant improvement in job growth, and the unemployment rate resumed its decline and now stands at\n4.8 percent.\n\nPayroll job growth picked up to a pace of nearly 2 percent last year, stronger than job growth in the state\nof Pennsylvania and in the nation. Reflecting the turnaround in energy prices, gains were especially\nstrong in mining and construction. The region’s growing reputation as an attractive tourist destination\nalso led to a rise in tourism-related jobs. The rise seen in education and healthcare jobs reflects a longerrun trend of economic diversification in the Pittsburgh region, which was discussed in a recent Cleveland\n\n\f8\nFed report in the Bank’s Industrial Heartland Series. 3 Such diversification allows regions to better adapt\nto changing economic forces.\n\nBut the region faces some challenges. Pittsburgh’s population has been declining over the past two\ndecades, the population is aging, and despite the presence of some of the best colleges and universities in\nthe country, many students leave the region after graduation. The Allegheny Conference on Community\nDevelopment recently updated its report on regional labor supply and demand. 4 The report projects that\nhealthcare and information technology workers will remain in high demand, but there will also be a\nsizable demand for engineers and skilled technicians linked to emerging technologies, including\nautonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, robotics, and ethane cracker and petrochemical\ndevelopment. The report documents a mismatch in the skill sets of residents in the region and the\nrequirements for workers who will be in highest demand. Reading the report gives you a sense of the\ncomplexity of the issues at hand. But you also learn of the positive steps being taken by business,\ncommunity, and civic leaders to address workforce development issues to ensure that Pittsburgh remains\neconomically competitive in the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. For some time now, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy of\ngradually removing the high level of accommodation that was needed to address the Great Recession.\nThis strategy is a balanced approach, reflecting the improvement in the economy over time and the\nprogress that has been made on our longer-run monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price\n\n3\n\nVenkatu, Guhan, “Rust and Renewal: A Pittsburgh Retrospective,” Industrial Heartland Series, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, February 2018.\n(https://clevelandfed.org/region/industrial-heartland/retrospectives.aspx#pittsburghreport)\n\n4\n\nThe Allegheny Conference on Community Development, “Inflection Point 2017-18: Supply, Demand and the\nFuture of Work in the Pittsburgh Region,” December 2017.\n(https://www.alleghenyconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/018_InflectionPoint.pdf)\n\n\f9\nstability. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I\nsupported this increase, and if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest\nrates will be appropriate this year and next year.\n\nIn my view, a gradual upward path of interest rates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks\nso that our monetary policy goals are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back\nto goal, and I don’t expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path. At the same time,\nthe economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and despite an increase in market volatility and\nlonger-term interest rates since the start of the year, financial conditions are accommodative. It is\nappropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure we avoid a\nbuild-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat.\nRecent research from the Cleveland Fed suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to\npull more people back into the workforce is unlikely to have any lasting effect on labor force\nparticipation. 5 Yet, overheating would have costs – it would necessitate sharper rate increases that could\nin themselves be destabilizing.\n\nA gradual upward path of interest rates should also help to avoid financial imbalances and a potential\nbuild-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates.\nCurrently, in my assessment, financial stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level. Leverage levels in\nthe household, nonfinancial, and financial sectors are low to moderate, and vulnerabilities arising from\nthe financial system’s role in transforming the maturity of assets or funding long-term assets with shortterm liabilities are moderate. But corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields are quite low, and\nprices in the commercial real estate market continue to rise while capitalization rates, which measure\n5\n\nFallick, Bruce, and Pawel Krolikowski, “Hysteresis in Employment among Disadvantaged Workers,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland Working Paper 18-01, February 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2018-working-papers/wp1801-hysteresis-in-employment-among-disadvantaged-workers.aspx)\n\n\f10\noperating income relative to the sale price of commercial properties, are at or near historical lows. These\ndevelopments are worth watching.\n\nContinued gradual reduction in monetary policy accommodation, given the economic outlook, will put\nmonetary policy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside,\nare ultimately realized. The path policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves.\nIf the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on\nthe downside, we may need to go a bit slower.\n\nSince last October, the FOMC has also been implementing its plan to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in\nterms of the size and composition of assets. 6 To address the Great Recession, after the FOMC brought\nthe fed funds rate down to effectively zero, it undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets,\nincluding longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were\nundertaken to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. We are now allowing\nmaturing longer-term assets to roll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this will take\nseveral years to complete.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\nI have been discussing the medium-run economic outlook and associated risks, but to conclude my talk,\nI’d like to address two interconnected longer-run issues facing the U.S. economy.\n\n6\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n\f11\nA country’s standard of living over the longer run depends on its longer-run growth rate, which, in turn,\ndepends on the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity, which measures how effectively\nthe economy combines labor and capital to create output.\n\nBased on demographics, labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in\nrecent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby\nboomers and women entered the workforce. But since then, labor force growth has slowed, rising at\nslightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016, and it is expected to remain near that level over\nthe next decade. 7\n\nLabor productivity growth has also been slow during this expansion. Some of this is cyclical, but more\npersistent structural factors may also be at play. 8 For example, the American spirit of innovation,\nentrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility have contributed to\neconomic growth and well-being in the U.S. These factors of dynamism allow resources to be reallocated\nfrom less-productive to more-productive businesses and allow workers to move up the career ladder. But\nthe level of dynamism has been declining for some time.\n\nThe combination of slow labor force growth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential\ngrowth rate of the economy will be lower than it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over\n\n7\n\nFor further discussion of demographics and economic growth, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their\nImplications for the Economy and Policy,” Cato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of\nMonetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November 16, 2017, and forthcoming in the Cato Journal.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-their-implicationsfor-the-economy-and-policy.aspx)\n8\n\nFor example, on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3\npercent of total employment per year. Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent. For further discussion of\ndynamism, see Mester, Loretta J., “The National and Regional Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” The\nAfrican American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania Annual Business Luncheon, Pittsburgh, PA,\nNovember 30, 2016.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161130-the-national-and-regional-economicoutlook-and-monetary-policy)\n\n\f12\nthe longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot slower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and\n1990s.\n\nOf course, this is not a fait accompli. Investment in human capital, in the form of education and training,\nand investment in physical capital and infrastructure can improve outcomes. The recently adopted\nchanges to the tax code may encourage such investment. Well-designed government policies can also\nhelp spur basic science, R&D, and innovation; make it easier for people to start up companies; and help to\nease the transition for households, industries, and communities being negatively affected by globalization\nand technological change. A well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a\nnecessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nBut such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a\nsustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under\ncurrent policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will be quite a bit higher 10 years from now, with the\nrecent fiscal policy changes estimated to add $1.6 trillion to the cumulative deficit over the next 10 years. 9\nBecause of the accumulating deficits, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP is projected to\nrise from 78 percent at the end of this year to nearly 100 percent in 2028, the highest it has been since\n1946. Note that the CBO estimates would be higher if the major provisions of the new tax and spending\npolicies are extended instead of expiring as they do under current law.\n\nEver-rising government debt levels would mean a higher share of government spending going to interest\npayments. This would tend to crowd out productive investments by the private sector and the\n\n9\n\nThe deficit as a percentage of GDP (adjusted to exclude the effects of shifting payments from one fiscal year into\nanother so that those payments are not made on a weekend) was 3.5 percent in 2017. Under the CBO’s baseline\nassumptions, the CBO projects this ratio to rise to 4.2 percent this year and to be 4.8 percent in 2028. See Summary\nTable 2 from CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028,” Congress of the United States, April 2018.\n(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651)\n\n\f13\ngovernment, thereby lowering productivity and longer-run growth. Investors would demand a higher risk\npremium in order to hold U.S. government debt. With over 40 percent of publicly held U.S. Treasury\ndebt held by foreigners, these interest payments need not be reinvested in the U.S. In addition, the\nsovereign debt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if\ninvestors lose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had\npreviously been viewed as risk-free rates. Longer-run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will depend on\nwhat combination of tax increases and spending controls are put in place to ensure that debt-to-GDP is on\na downward path.\n\nAnd this brings me back to monetary policy. Unless the U.S. can get its longer-run fiscal situation in\norder, high debt levels will constrain using fiscal policy as a tool to buoy the economy in recessions. This\nwill put more of the burden on monetary policy to stimulate the economy during downturns. But in a\nworld with lower potential growth and lower equilibrium interest rates, monetary policy will also have\nless room to act. The zero lower bound on interest rates would be hit more often, and we would find\nourselves having to rely more often on nonconventional policy tools like asset purchases.\n\nToday’s healthy outlook for the U.S. economy over the medium run gives policymakers the opportunity\nto consider these longer-run issues, which the country will need to deal with in order to ensure a healthy\neconomy in the future.\n\nBefore I overstay my welcome, let me end here and thank you for your attention. I look forward to your\nquestions.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Why I Want You to Study Economics:\nIncreasing Diversity, Inclusion, and Opportunity in Economics\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nLeaders, Executives, Entrepreneurs, and Directors (LEED) Program\nCentral State University College of Business\nWilberforce, OH\n\nApril 4, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers of this year’s LEED program and Professor Fidelis Ikem, the dean of the College of\nBusiness, for inviting me to speak today. I am proud of the relationship that the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland is building with Central State University. It’s great to be on campus today, where one feels a\nreal sense of history. At the Federal Reserve, we are proud of the fact that while the first two attempts at\ncentral banks in the U.S. lasted only 20 years each, the Fed is in its 105th year. But Central State is even\nolder. Founded in 1887, the university recently celebrated its 131st birthday. Central State’s designation\nas a historically black college and its focus on providing a high-quality academic experience to all\nstudents are things to be proud of. They make this university a very good place for me to speak about the\nbenefits of an education in economics and the importance of diversity in the field of economics. Before I\ncontinue, I should remind everyone that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhy Study Economics\nI didn’t start out to be an economist. I majored in mathematics at Barnard College but also pursued a\nsecond major in economics because it seemed interesting and didn’t require much additional course work.\nI applied to graduate school in math but ended up in the economics Ph.D. program at Princeton because\ntwo professors there wrote me letters explaining that Princeton’s economics program was very\nmathematical and encouraging me to come there and study economics. I’ve always thought that I lucked\ninto economics. It has provided me with a fascinating career, and I hope that at least in a small way I’ve\nbeen able to provide some good in return through economic research and policymaking.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines economics as “a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis\nof the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.” Well, that’s fine as far as it goes,\nbut it sounds kind of dry. Others think of economics as a path to running a business or working in\nfinance. That’s also fine as far as it goes, but it is too limited a view. Instead, I like to think of economics\nas a social science that helps us think about how people use scarce resources, interact in markets or in\n\n\f2\nother economic settings, respond to incentives, and make trade-offs. The fact that economics is a social\nscience, one that involves people and their choices, makes economics complicated but also very\ninteresting.\n\nBecause economics provides a rigorous way of thinking about trade-offs, incentives, and costs and\nbenefits, it has many real-world applications. It can help a company be more profitable but it can also\nhelp policymakers formulate better public policies that affect people’s lives. It can help us analyze the\ndistribution of income across individuals, regions, and countries, and the causes for those differences. It\ncan help us understand how a small financial shock might be propagated economy-wide or even globally,\nand what can be done to prevent such contagion. It can help us understand the issues facing people in or\nentering the workforce and provide evidence on which programs are most effective at helping them\nfinance their education, develop new skills, and manage the changing job landscape driven by\ntechnological innovation. Economics can help us understand how people make financial decisions and\nhow simple changes can result in better outcomes. For example, a simple change from making employees\nhave to opt out of a company’s savings plan, rather than opt in, can result in higher participation in the\nplan.1 One well-formulated study of a Fortune 500 company’s 401(k) savings plan found that switching\nto automatic enrollment increased employee participation from 49 percent to 86 percent. It also found\nthat employees’ savings decisions tend to be inert, so the default contribution rate and fund allocation are\nimportant features to consider in designing such a plan.\n\nA default rule like this is an example of what behavioral economists call a nudge – something that isn’t\nmandated but points people in the right direction and can change behavior.2 Richard Thaler, an\neconomics professor at the University of Chicago, won a Nobel Prize last year for his foundational work\nin behavioral economics, which combines aspects of psychology with economics. In his Nobel Prize\n1\n2\n\nSee Chetty, et al. (2017).\n\nFor accessible descriptions and examples of nudging, see Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in\nMemory of Alfred Nobel (2017), Thaler (2017a), and Sunstein (2017).\n\n\f3\nlunch lecture, he mentioned that good work is being done around the world to, and I quote: “design and\ntest scientifically informed policies that are working. People are being helped to save more for\nretirement, more poor kids – especially girls – are going to school, peasant farmers are retrieving more\nreliable harvests, and we are all being successfully nudged to use less energy.”3 That passage lists just a\nfew of the areas in which economics is having a real-world impact and doing some good. In the policy\nrealm, economics helps guide decisions about the country’s monetary and fiscal policies, but also policies\non health care, education, and trade. It helps in the design and evaluation of programs at the local\ncommunity level too, including workforce development and transportation policy. In a nutshell, I believe\nthat economics helps society.\n\nI hope this piques your interest in studying economics. But if you need more convincing, you might want\nto know that economics offers a very good return on your education dollar. The ability to think critically,\nanalyze a problem systematically, and deal with ambiguity are all skills developed through the study of\neconomics and they are all skills highly valued in the job market. One recent study found that those with\na bachelor’s degree in economics earn about 20 percent more than graduates with degrees in other fields.4\nSome of the salary differences reflect the fact that economics majors have access to a wide variety of\noccupations, many of which are higher-paying. You’ll find people with economics degrees employed in\nmany sectors, including education, accounting, law, business, finance, and government. The Federal\nReserve System – the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors – employs about 700 Ph.D.\neconomists and also many others with undergraduate and master’s degrees in economics, and I can tell\nyou from experience that the Fed is a very productive and fascinating place to work.\n\n3\n\nThaler (2017b).\n\n4\n\nCarroll, et al. (2014).\n\n\f4\nThe State of Diversity in Economics\nThe good news is that economics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities. In 2016, U.S.\npostsecondary schools awarded about 33,500 bachelor’s degrees in economics.5 While this represents\nless than 2 percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded by these schools, at the top 100 universities and top\n100 liberal arts colleges without an undergraduate business major, about 10 to 20 percent of male\nundergraduates major in economics.6 That’s a high number when you consider how many different\nmajors there are. But despite its popularity, the field has had less success in attracting women or\nhistorically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities.7 While there has been some improvement\ncompared to the 1970s, this under-representation has been going on for many years.\n\nUsing U.S. Department of Education data on four-year, non-profit colleges and universities over 20112015, Bayer and Wilcox found that while women earned more than half of all bachelor’s degrees awarded\nacross all fields, they earned less than a third of the bachelor’s degrees in economics.8 And the numbers\nare lower for under-represented minorities, who earned slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor’s\ndegrees and about 11 percent of economics degrees awarded. If you think about this in terms of the share\nof female graduates who choose to major in economics and the share of male graduates who choose to\nmajor in economics, according to Bayer and Wilcox’s numbers, there is one female economics major for\nevery 100 female bachelor’s degrees compared to about three male economics majors for every 100 male\nbachelor’s degrees. That means women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of\n\n5\n\nThe data on the number and proportion of bachelor’s degrees in economics in U.S. postgraduate institutions are\nderived from Tables 325.92 and 322.10 from U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education\nStatistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n6\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015).\n\n7\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) classifies as\nhistorically under-represented minorities members of the following groups: Hispanic or Latino (non-Hispanic),\n(non-Hispanic) Black or African American, and American Indian or Native Alaskan. The IPEDS data are used by\nthe American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession\n(CSMGEP) to assess minority representation in the field.\n8\n\nBayer and Wilcox (2017).\n\n\f5\nmen.9 Similarly, minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white\nstudents.\n\nWhile you don’t need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a natural\npath. So given the under-representation of women and minorities at the undergraduate level, it is\nprobably not surprising they are also under-represented at the Ph.D. level and in academia. The good\nnews is that representation of women among the ranks of academia, from first-year graduate student\nthrough full professor, is higher now than in 1970.10 The bad news is that progress has slowed. In 2017,\nfemales made up 32 percent of first-year grad students in economics compared to 30 percent in 1997.\nAlmost a third of the new doctorates in 2017 were awarded to women, but gender diversity falls as one\nmoves up the academic ranks. Women make up less than 30 percent of assistant professors, about 23\npercent of tenured associates, and about 14 percent of full professors in economics. Unless there is a\npickup in entry into graduate school, it is hard to see how these numbers can increase.\n\nAnalysis of minority representation in graduate economics is complicated a bit by the fact that almost 60\npercent of doctorates awarded in economics are awarded to nonpermanent resident students. Some of\nthese graduates return to their own countries, while others stay in the U.S. Restricting attention to U.S.\ncitizens and permanent residents, of the 479 economics doctorates awarded in 2016, only 48, that is, 10\npercent, were awarded to under-represented minorities: 15 were earned by African Americans and 33 by\nHispanics or Latinos.11 In the academic professorial ranks, under-represented minorities make up less\nthan 10 percent of assistant professors and less than 5 percent of full professors.\n\n9\n\nAmong schools in the top 100 that offer both business and economics degrees, regardless of gender, students prefer\nthe business degree over economics, but women do so to a greater extent. See Goldin (2013, 2015).\n10\n\nThe statistics cited in this paragraph are the preliminary statistics for 2017 compiled by the American Economic\nAssociation’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. See Lundberg (2017).\n11\n\nThese statistics are from the U.S. Department of Education IPEDS data as reported in Committee on the Status of\nMinority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2017).\n\n\f6\nThere has been some progress: the percentages of undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded to\nminorities have increased over the past two decades. But the rate of change has been slower than the\ngrowth of the minority population in the U.S. and slower than the growth of minority representation\nacross all fields and in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. Indeed, minorities\nearn a greater share of the degrees awarded in the STEM fields than they do in economics.12 Similarly,\nthe representation of women in the STEM fields is also now higher than it is in economics.13\n\nWhy Isn’t Economics Diverse and Why Does It Matter?\nAn interesting question is why women and minorities are under-represented in economics. One potential\nexplanation is the lack of role models in the field. Seeing someone of the same race or gender being\nsuccessful in a field can be validating, and having someone like you to run ideas by or get advice from\ncan be very helpful. So, the relative lack of women and minorities in economics could be perpetuating\nunder-representation. This is a plausible explanation but it may be only one piece of the puzzle, as the\nempirical evidence on role models is somewhat mixed.14 One study of a selective liberal arts college that\nessentially involved random assignment of students to instructors found that having an instructor of the\nsame gender didn’t increase the probability of a student taking more classes or majoring in the field,\nregardless of the gender distribution in the department, but it was associated with the student earning a\nhigher grade in fields dominated by the opposite gender.15 That is, female students received higher\naverage grades from female instructors when taking courses in fields dominated by men (such as\neconomics) – the difference was on the order of moving from a B-minus to a B. And there was a similar\neffect for males, who received higher average grades from male instructors when taking courses in\nfemale-dominated fields (such as education). A separate study in a different setting found evidence that\n\n12\n\nCommittee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession (CSMGEP) (2017).\n\n13\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015).\n\n14\n\nGoldin (2013) and Griffith (2013).\n\n15\n\nGriffith (2014).\n\n\f7\nsuch grade differentials reflected achievement differentials and not just inflated grading.16 So the\navailability of role models appears to positively affect student achievement, but a lack of role models isn’t\nthe whole story about why some students choose not to continue in economics.\n\nWhat about different preferences at the time students enroll? It is true that males are more likely than\nfemales to list economics as their planned major when accepted at college. But this gender difference for\nincoming students is not the full story because research that looks at the progression of students through\nthe major has found that female students are relatively more likely to drop out of the major and switch to\nanother field compared to male students. For example, one study found that women need to do well in\ntheir principles of economics course in order to continue in the major, and that’s less true of men.17\n\nOther hypotheses have to do with the way economics is taught or with the content of the courses. Do\nlarge lecture classes, often found in introductory economics programs at large universities, turn off\nwomen and minorities more than men? Do the topics incorporated into the intro courses appeal to one\ngroup and not another? And, if so, how could the content be amended so that all students, regardless of\nrace, ethnicity, or gender, feel included and take up the opportunity to be an economics major? Could it\nbe that implicit biases come to play at each stage of the academic ladder, as has been shown in other types\nof settings?\n\nAs a college math major, I am happy to say that the theory that women may be more turned off by the\nheavy mathematical content in economics does not pan out. In fact, women earn over 40 percent of\nbachelor’s degrees in math and statistics, a higher share than in economics;18 women do well in math at\nthe high school level; women are selecting other fields that are very quantitative, like psychology; and\n16\n\nCarrell, et al. (2010).\n\n17\n\nGoldin (2013, 2015) and Avilova and Goldin (2018).\n\n18\n\nTable 325.65, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary\nEducation Data System (IPEDS).\n\n\f8\nstudies indicate that math aptitude doesn’t explain gender differences in participation in upper-level\neconomics courses.19\n\nSo there are several different theories being explored, and I suspect that, at the end of the day, there are\nmultiple drivers of the under-representation of women and minorities in the field of economics. But you\nmight ask: why should we care? Shouldn’t students be able to choose their field of study and career path?\nThe low level of diversity in economics may just reflect people’s preferences. That’s a possibility, but if\nthat’s the case, then it is incumbent upon those of us in the field and upon educators to ensure that\nstudents can make informed choices and that they understand the value of an economics degree to the\nindividual and to society.\n\nMoreover, because economics is a field that influences policy, and policy affects all kinds of people, it’s\nimportant to have diverse views inform that policy. As a public servant and Fed policymaker, I believe\nthat policymakers need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all\nour constituents. In addition, I have seen firsthand how having a diversity of views expressed and\ndiscussed around the table can actually lead to better policy decisions, and there is actual research to back\nthis up. Group dynamics are different when teams are diverse. Participants don’t necessarily find it as\ncomfortable to serve on a diverse team, but the diversity helps to avoid group-think. Diverse teams tend\nto be more objective and focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more\ncarefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and convince those with\nalternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative.20 Research also shows that\nfirms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings.21 Perhaps the better decisionmaking and innovation associated with diversity is showing up on the bottom line.\n\n19\n\nSee Goldin (2013), and Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n20\n\nSee Rock and Grant (2016).\n\n21\n\nRock and Grant (2016) cite a Credit Suisse analysis of 2,400 companies worldwide that found that organizations\nwith at least one female board member had higher return on equity and higher net income growth than firms with no\nfemale board members. In addition, Hunt, et al. (2015) report on a McKinsey & Company analysis of 366\n\n\f9\n\nBeyond current policy and business outcomes, another reason I’d like to see more diversity in the field of\neconomics is so the field itself doesn’t get stymied by group-think. To expand our knowledge, economics\nneeds to continually take on new research questions and develop innovative techniques and ways of\nanalysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means a broader set\nof issues will be tackled and a broader set of research disseminated, resulting in better policy outcomes\nthat will improve the economic well being of a greater share of the population.\n\nSome Things Are Being Done\nThe American Economic Association, through its Committees on the Status of Women and the Status of\nMinority Groups in the Economics Profession, is taking a close look at diversity in the economics\nprofession and is offering programs and resources aimed at increasing diversity at all levels. The\nassociation provides information to students who want to pursue careers or a graduate degree in\neconomics, and also provides lesson plans to teachers. It offers a summer training and scholarship\nprogram to help prepare students for graduate school and, with the National Science Foundation, offers a\nSummer Economics Fellows Program, which is designed to increase the participation and advancement of\nwomen and under-represented minorities in economics.\n\nI serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education. This nonprofit organization’s mission is to\neducate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance so they can\nmake better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. The council provides many\nmaterials to teachers and also runs the National Economics Challenge, a quiz bowl competition, which\nreaches a wide population of students in terms of gender, race, and income. Last year, over 11,000 high\nschool students participated in the challenge; of these, 42 percent were girls and 22 percent were undercompanies that found that those in the top quartile in terms of management’s ethnic and racial diversity were 35\npercent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean, while those in the top quartile in terms of\nmanagement’s gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean.\n\n\f10\nrepresented minorities, and participation from these groups has been increasing over time. A recent\nsurvey found that participants’ performance on advanced placement exams exceeds the national average,\nwith especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely\nthan nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.\n\nAt the Cleveland Fed, we strive for excellence in all that we do. And that means we are taking actions to\nfoster a culture that champions diversity, inclusion, and opportunity throughout the organization. To\nincrease our ability to recruit high-quality talent in a variety of positions, including banking, computer\nprogramming, data science, accounting, as well as economics, we are developing relationships with\nschools in our District, including Central State. Last June, we hosted a number of Central State students\nand several faculty members as part of your school’s eight-week summer Banking Institute program, and\nwe will host another group of CSU students again next month. You may have attended one of the guest\nlectures that some of our economists have given in your economics and business classes, and\nrepresentatives are here today to tell you about paid internships and other employment opportunities at the\nCleveland Fed. As a contribution to strengthening the pipeline of future economists, the Cleveland Fed\nwill be hosting a workshop this summer for the research assistants across the Federal Reserve System to\nhelp them prepare for graduate school. The Cleveland Fed has also been promoting pre- and post-college\neducation. Our Learning Center distributes lesson plans on economics and financial literacy to teachers in\nkindergarten through high school, and our Money Museum, which is open to the public, offers interactive\nexhibits on the financial system and the economy. These may be small steps, but economics can help\nsolve many real-world problems while providing individuals with a rewarding career, and we want to\nensure that the widest group of people enter the field.\n\nConclusion\nFifty years ago today, this country lost a great leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The tragedy of his\ndeath must not overshadow his many accomplishments and the lessons conveyed by his words and deeds.\nAs I’ve discussed, there has been some progress over the past 50 years in increasing diversity,\n\n\f11\ninclusiveness, and opportunity within the economics profession, but that progress has been slow. It is\neasy to get discouraged and accept the status quo. But we all must remember a key lesson from Dr.\nKing’s legacy: changing institutions is hard work and takes time. It must be met by perseverance and\nendurance. As a member of the economics profession, I will continue to seek ways to increase diversity,\ninclusion, and opportunity because I believe it will strengthen economic research and policymaking, and\nthereby help promote a healthier economy for a wider group of people.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, NJ\n\nMarch 26, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the organizers at the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for inviting me to speak today. It’s nice to be back\nat Princeton. Walking up from the Dinky station, I was impressed by the changes on campus, including\nseveral new buildings since my days here as a graduate student. But one thing hasn’t changed, and that’s\nthe sense of energy and inquisitiveness among the people on campus. Although it has been several years\nsince I graduated, I use the knowledge I gained at Princeton every day in my role at the Federal Reserve.\n\nToday, I’ll discuss my views on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy and make a few\nremarks on two future issues for the monetary policy agenda. I believe it’s important for Fed\npolicymakers to explain the rationale for their policy decisions to the public, so I am looking forward to\ntaking your questions after my remarks. Before I continue, I should remind everyone that the views I’ll\npresent today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nAt its meeting last week, the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within\nthe Fed, decided to raise the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4\npercent. This rate increase is consistent with the healthy outlook for the economy, and the achieved and\nexpected progress on our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be another good year for the economy, and the task before monetary\npolicymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy economy so that the expansion is sustained. Given the\neconomy’s strength, we don’t want to get behind the curve, but we also don’t want to overreact to the\npositive outlook and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing, and in my\nview, last week’s decision on rates reflects this type of balanced approach to achieving and maintaining\nour policy goals.\n\n\f2\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth to be a bit above that pace\nthis year and next. This is an improvement from the average 2 percent pace over prior years of the\nexpansion. In addition, growth is now more balanced across sectors. Business investment accelerated\nlast year. Nonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent last year, compared to an anemic\npace of less than 1 percent in 2015 and 2016. You may recall that oil prices fell sharply from mid-2014\nthrough early 2016, and this led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers.\nThe drop in oil prices was coupled with a greater than 20 percent appreciation in the value of the dollar,\nwhich hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Those conditions are now reversing.\nLast year, oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the economies of our trading partners began to\nstrengthen.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up and forecasts\nfor global growth are being revised up. This should have a positive feedback effect on the U.S. economy\nvia exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the recent announcement of planned\ntariffs on certain goods imported from China, as well as the ongoing renegotiations of the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), add uncertainty to the trade picture. This uncertainty may\nnot be resolved quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on how\nother countries react, including whether they impose their own tariffs or other trade barriers in response. I\nam monitoring trade developments, and while I see them as a risk to the forecast, at this point they have\nnot led me to change my outlook for the overall economy.\n\nBusiness sentiment remains high and firms will gain from the tax changes passed in December. The\nrecently passed federal budget and spending appropriation bills will add further fiscal stimulus in the form\nof increased federal spending. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude and timing of\n\n\f3\nthe effect of these fiscal policy changes on output growth. I’m estimating they will add an additional 1/2\npercentage point of annual growth over the next couple of years, but there is some upside risk that the\neffect could be larger. I expect to have a better read on the timing of the federal spending and on how\nhouseholds and firms are actually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nLower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional\nbusiness spending to meet higher near-term demand. In a staff survey of firms in the Cleveland Fed\nDistrict, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings this year said they planned to use some of the\nproceeds to increase investment. Smaller percentages of respondents said they planned to buy back\nshares of their stock, increase dividends, or pay down debt with their tax gains. About a third of the\nsurveyed firms in the District said they planned to share some of their tax savings with employees in the\nform of increased wages, bonuses, or additions to employee pension plans. And some firms in the\nDistrict and elsewhere in the nation have already done so.\n\nThis adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending, which makes up over\ntwo-thirds of output. Personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower\npersonal tax rates and higher standard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the\naggregate, although the impact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and\nsources of their income. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession,\nreflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. While there has been a marked increase\nin market volatility since the start of the year, equity prices are higher than they were a year ago.\n\nA moderately paced recovery in the housing sector continues, despite the increase in mortgage rates.\nHousing equity held by households is now above its peak before the housing crash. Overall, I expect\nactivity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\n\f4\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Payroll jobs rose by more than 300,000\nin February, following an increase of more than 200,000 in January. These job numbers are a pickup\nfrom last year’s already strong pace of 180,000 jobs per month. Most economists put trend job growth\nsomewhere in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The variation depends on what one\nassumes about labor force participation. Based on demographic factors, including the aging of the\npopulation, the longer-run trend in participation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation\nrate has been fairly stable over the past two years, and last month we saw a rise in the participation rate,\nincluding that of prime-age males. Indeed, the participation rate of men aged 45 to 54 has shown a\nnotable increase of nearly 1.5 percentage points over the past year.\n\nIncreased participation helps ease some of the tightness we are seeing in the labor supply. As both\nnational and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts have been reporting for some time that\nthey are having trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now coming from a wide range of\nfirms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill occupations. The unemployment\nrate, at 4.1 percent, is low by historical standards. It’s below its lowest point during the last expansion\nand below the range most economists associate with full employment.\n\nOf course, it’s difficult to say with any precision how tight labor markets are. Usually we associate tight\nlabor markets with rising wages. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth has moved up,\nfrom under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. And increasingly,\nfirms are telling us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to\nattract and retain workers. But so far wage growth hasn’t been as strong as one might normally expect\nfrom tight labor markets. One partial explanation for this is the low level of productivity growth. Over\nthe longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this\n\n\f5\nexpansion, labor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent. 1 This is less than half the\npace over the prior two expansions. Last year we saw somewhat stronger growth in productivity than we\nsaw earlier in the expansion. It is too soon to tell whether this rise will be sustained; however, the\nwelcome pickup we are seeing in investment should help to promote productivity growth as the expansion\ncontinues, and this should help buoy wage growth.\n\nThe movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that wage and price inflation have\nremained moderate even as labor markets continue to strengthen, suggest that labor market conditions\nmay not be as tight as I had been assuming. So I recently moved my own estimate of the longer-run\nunemployment rate down by 1/4 percentage point, to 4-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to\nmove below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. Overall, my assessment remains\nthat from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond\nthe maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling;\nthe FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below this goal\nand such persistent deviations warrant a policy response. 2 But inflation measures can vary from month to\nmonth because of idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances.\nSometimes inflation will be above and sometimes it will be below 2 percent. While monetary policy’s\n1\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24, 2012;\nas amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\n\n\f6\ncontrol of inflation isn’t precise enough to keep inflation at 2 percent at each point in time, averaging\nthrough temporary fluctuations, we aim for inflation to be 2 percent because the FOMC believes that this\nrate is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate.\n\nGetting inflation back to this goal has been somewhat of a challenge. PCE inflation fell to very low levels\nin 2015, when inflation was held down by falling oil and import prices. Since then it has moved back up,\neven temporarily exceeding 2 percent early last year, until it moved back below 2 percent in the middle of\nlast year partly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone\nservice plans. Since then, inflation has picked up and several of our business contacts have reported that\nthey now have more pricing power and have been able to pass along some of their cost increases to\ncustomers.\n\nPCE inflation has risen to about 1.7 percent, not quite at our goal. In the near term, we will likely see\nsome higher inflation readings as the sharp price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year\nmeasures. But just as we didn’t overreact to weaker inflation readings last summer or to stronger inflation\nreadings at the beginning of last year, we shouldn’t overreact to these increases either. Mild temporary\nover- or under-runs of inflation should not be cause for concern. Instead, we need to remain focused on\nthe medium-run outlook for inflation.\n\nMy outlook is that inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one\nto two years. This forecast reflects my expectation that the economy will continue to grow above trend\nand the demand for labor will continue to strengthen. Stable inflation expectations are another important\ncomponent of this forecast because inflation expectations help to anchor actual inflation rates. We\nalready saw how valuable stable inflation expectations were during the Great Recession. At that time, the\ndeep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could have led to deflation – not just low inflation rates\nbut a declining overall price level. This would have made the economy even worse by making demand\n\n\f7\neven weaker than it was and raising debt burdens in real terms. But deflationary conditions did not\ndevelop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s expectations that prices would remain\nstable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal.\n\nOne of the risks of having inflation under-run the 2 percent goal for so long is that inflation expectations\ncould have become unanchored. That didn’t happen. Now, as inflation firms, it is equally important that\nmonetary policymakers continue to convey through policy communications and decisions our\ncommitment to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThe recent policy action to increase the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent is\nconsistent with this commitment and continues the process to gradually increase interest rates as the\neconomy has continued to make progress on our monetary policy goals. I supported the increase in the fed\nfunds rate last week and, if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further gradual increases in\ninterest rates will be appropriate this year and next year. In my view a gradual upward path of interest\nrates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks so that our longer-run goals of price stability\nand maximum employment are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back to goal;\nthis argues against a steep path. At the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum\nemployment, and despite an increase in market volatility and longer-term interest rates since the start of\nthe year, financial conditions are accommodative. It seems appropriate to remove some of the monetary\npolicy accommodation to ensure we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise\nif the economy were allowed to overheat. In addition, a gradual upward path of interest rates should help\navoid financial imbalances and a potential build-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the\nextended period of very low interest rates. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address\nwhatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\n\f8\nThe gradual upward path of interest rates is consistent with the median path across the projections\nsubmitted by FOMC participants at last week’s meeting. The median path of appropriate policy in those\nprojections has the fed funds rate gradually rising to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent by the end of this year,\nwith further gradual increases over the next two years should the economy evolve as anticipated.\nCompared to the December projections, the FOMC’s median path over next year and the following year\nhas steepened a bit, reflecting the policymakers’ views that the medium-run outlook has strengthened,\nwith somewhat stronger output growth and a lower unemployment rate. The change in the median path is\nan excellent illustration of how our views of appropriate policy are related to the economic outlook.\nPolicymakers don’t react to any small change in the data, but if incoming information suggests a change\nin our medium-run forecast, our projected appropriate policy path can change. The FOMC projections\ngive a sense of the participants’ current views on appropriate policy given their current outlook. But the\npath policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves and the implications of\nincoming information for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to\ngrowth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we\nmay need to go a bit slower.\n\nI’ve been discussing the fed funds rate because changing its target range is the main way to adjust the\nstance of policy during normal times. But during extraordinary times, other tools are needed. To address\nthe Great Recession, the FOMC brought the fed funds rate down to effectively zero, and then to put\nfurther downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, it undertook several programs to purchase\nlonger-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\nAs a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6\npercent of nominal GDP, to about $4.4 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The balance sheet’s\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\n\f9\nLast October, the FOMC began implementing its plan to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in terms of the\nsize and composition of assets. 3 Maturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency\ndebt are allowed to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over\ntime. The gradual, predictable decline in assets, which will take several years to complete, allows\nbalance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the\nappropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nFuture Considerations for the Monetary Policy Agenda: Operating Framework and Monetary\nPolicy Framework\nI’d like to end my talk by briefly touching on two future monetary policy considerations: the operating\nframework that the FOMC uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level,\nand the monetary policy framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the\npolicy rate is to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals. 4\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn’t tell you how large the Fed’s balance sheet will be once we complete\nnormalization. We do know the balance sheet will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the\nsimple reason that the public’s demand for currency is rising over time. But the balance sheet will also\nlikely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on how the FOMC\n\n3\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf)\n\n4\n\nFor further discussion of monetary policy frameworks, see Mester, Loretta J., “Monetary Policy Frameworks,”\nNational Association for Business Economics and American Economic Association Session at the Allied Social\nScience Associations Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, January 5, 2018,\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180105-monetary-policy-frameworks) and\nMester, Loretta J., “Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework,” panel remarks at the 2018 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School\nof Business, New York, NY, February 23, 2018.\n(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20180223-remarks-on-the-fomcs-monetarypolicy-framework).\n\n\f10\nimplements monetary policy in the future. 5 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves\nscarce. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries,\nand this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to\neach other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC’s target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks\nare holding around $2.2 trillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and about $2 trillion of this amount is\nin excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have\nlittle effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by\nadjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves.\n\nEach of these operating frameworks has its strengths, and as balance-sheet normalization progresses, the\nFOMC will need to decide which operating framework it will use going forward.\n\nAnother consideration for the FOMC is the framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy.\nCurrently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework recognizes that, over the\nlonger run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of\nthe economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary\npolicy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment. I\nbelieve this framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in promoting our policy goals.\nIt has been the choice of many central banks around the globe.\n5\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\nFor projections of the Fed’s asset holdings in its System Open Market Account (SOMA), see Bonis, Brian,\nIhrig, Jane, and Wei, Min, “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the 10-Year Treasury Term Premium\nEffect,” FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 22, 2017\n(https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081).\n\n\f11\n\nNevertheless, it is legitimate to ask whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be\nhelpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability. First, as a matter of good governance, a central bank\nshould periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. 6 Second, based on demographics,\nhigher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term\nequilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades. If so, then compared to the past,\nthere would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock, the\nprobability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would be higher, and nontraditional monetary\npolicy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the\ntraditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the potential would be for longer\nrecessions and longer bouts of low inflation. 7\n\nTo help mitigate this issue, researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting\nan inflation rate higher than 2 percent, or instead of targeting inflation, targeting a path for the price level\nor for nominal GDP. The positives and negatives of these and other frameworks would need to be\nthoroughly reviewed. Such reviews take considerable time and so it may be appropriate for the FOMC to\ncommence a framework assessment later this year.\n\nI am open-minded on the outcome, but at the same time, I think the bar should be high for adopting a new\nframework. The current framework has been largely successful, there is little experience with alternative\nframeworks here or abroad, and since we are not starting from scratch, transition costs would need to be\nconsidered. Even if the FOMC concludes it is best not to adopt a new framework, the review will help\n6\n\nFor example, the Bank of Canada renews its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five years.\nThe next renewal is in 2021.\n7\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n\n\f12\ndetermine if improvements to the current framework could make it even more effective at achieving our\nmonetary policy goals, given the current and future economic environment.\n\nNow, paraphrasing French mathematician Blaise Pascal, if I had had more time, I would have written a\nshorter speech. Before we run out of time for questions, I’d like to end here and thank you for your\nattention.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Remarks on the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks at the\n2018 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nSponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets\nat the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 23, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI will focus my brief remarks on the FOMC’s monetary policy framework for determining the appropriate\npolicy to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals. 1 The views I’ll present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nRecently, some economists and policymakers have recommended that the FOMC evaluate its monetary\npolicy framework. Indeed, a careful reader of the January FOMC minutes, released earlier this week,\nmight have noticed that a few participants suggested such an examination. 2 The FOMC has not indicated\nwhether or not it will undertake such a review. But let me provide my own thoughts on the rationale for\nundertaking an assessment, what it might cover, and the timing, that is, the why, what, and when of a\nreview. I’ll also briefly discuss some alternative frameworks that should be part of the assessment. But\nfirst, some background.\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting\nThe Fed’s longer-run monetary policy goals are price stability and maximum employment. Congress\nspecified these goals but gave the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to\nachieve these goals. The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework\nrecognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying\nreal structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum\nemployment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment\nfrom maximum employment.\n\n1\n\nI view the monetary policy framework as distinct from the operating framework, which is more tactical and is\nconcerned with the tools used to implement appropriate policy choices, e.g., whether to operate with a large amount\nof reserves as in a floor system or a smaller amount of reserves as in a corridor system to hit the policy interest rate.\n\n2\n\nFOMC (February 2018).\n\n\f2\n\nThe framework is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy\nstrategy. 3 This statement was initially released in January 2012 when the FOMC adopted an explicit\nnumerical inflation goal. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means\nthat the 2 percent inflation goal is not a ceiling. The inflation measures will vary from month to month,\nsometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average\nover the longer run.\n\nWhy Review the Framework?\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in\npromoting our monetary policy goals. So why review the framework? There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst, as a matter of good governance, it behooves the Fed to conduct periodic reviews of its assumptions,\nmethods, and models. This is the way the FOMC has operated for some time. For example, as indicated\nin the minutes, the January FOMC meeting included staff briefings and a discussion of inflation analysis\nand forecasting models.4 It is a standard best practice for a central bank to assess its performance. 5\n\nAnother reason for the FOMC to review its framework derives from the experience of the Great\nRecession and its aftermath. To fight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, the policy rate\nwas brought to effectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and unconventional tools, including\nforward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, were used. Although the recovery was slow in coming,\nthe economic expansion is now firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and inflation is expected to\n\n3\n\nSee FOMC (January 30, 2018).\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC (February 2018).\n\n5\n\nFor example, the Bank of Canada renews its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five years.\nThe next renewal is in 2021.\n\n\f3\nreturn to 2 percent on a sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis\neconomic environment is expected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates due to changes in\ndemographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the\nlonger-term equilibrium interest rate. 6,7 Real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past\ndecades. If so, then compared to the past, there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion\nagainst a negative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would\nbe higher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that\nthese tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the\npotential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate\nquestion of whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining\nmacroeconomic stability in this environment. 8\n\nWhat Should a Review Cover?\nWe cannot know whether the FOMC would have been even more successful had it used a different\nmonetary policy framework in the times leading up to and following the financial crisis. But that’s the\nwrong question. The review should focus on evaluating whether changing the framework could make\nmonetary policy even more effective given the current and future economic environment.\n\n6\n\nSee Mester (2017).\n\n7\n\nFOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum\nemployment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March\n2014 to 2.8 percent today. (See FOMC (April 2014) and FOMC (January 2018).) Also, empirical estimates of the\nequilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past. For a review of\nthe literature on the equilibrium interest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n\n8\n\nAlthough I don’t discuss them here, other government policies might also be brought to bear to increase the longterm growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Such policies\nwould focus on increasing productivity growth and labor force participation.\n\n\f4\nI remain open-minded on this. At the same time, a change from flexible inflation targeting shouldn’t be\ndecided cavalierly. There is little experience with alternative frameworks because the central banks of\nmost advanced economies like the U.S. have used some form of inflation targeting. In my view, the\nsuccess of the current framework, coupled with the lack of empirical evidence on alternatives, means that\nthe bar should be high for changing to a new framework. It is important to recognize that any framework\nwill have positives and negatives and we are not starting from scratch, there is a framework in place, so\ntransition costs need to be considered.\n\nTwo important parts of any framework are communication and credibility. The FOMC has been on a\njourney over the past couple of decades to make our monetary policy more transparent to the public and\nChairman Powell has emphasized that the FOMC will continue on this journey. 9 When the public has a\nbetter understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy decisions, they are better able to hold\npolicymakers accountable for their actions. But effective communication also makes monetary policy\nitself more effective by providing the public with information about the economic outlook and aligning\nthe public’s expectations about future policy actions. Thus, an important aspect of any framework is how\nwell it communicates monetary policy to businesses and households that are making economic decisions.\nIf the framework is not well understood, its benefits cannot be captured.\n\nAnother important aspect of any monetary policy framework is its credibility. Is the framework credible\nto the public so that they will formulate expectations about future policy based on the framework? Is it a\nframework that future Committees will stick with? Of course, one determinant of a framework’s\ncredibility is its effectiveness in achieving monetary policy goals. So effectiveness, communication, and\ncredibility, and the interactions among these three need to be part of assessing the framework.\n\n9\n\nSee Powell (2018).\n\n\f5\nWhen Should a Review Commence?\nAfter coming through the financial crisis and Great Recession, the economy has returned to normal and\nmonetary policy, including the policy rate and the balance sheet, is normalizing. The smooth transition to\nnew Fed leadership is also underway. Nothing is broken and a return to a normal economy and normal\npolicymaking gives us an opportunity to look at some longer-run issues. This suggests to me that it may\nbe appropriate later this year to begin an assessment of our current monetary policy framework and\nalternatives. Such reviews take time and should be thorough. As I mentioned, the FOMC adopted its\nnumerical inflation goal in January 2012, but this came after years of study and discussion going back to\nat least May 1996, with subsequent discussions in 2005, 2009, and 2011. Even if the FOMC concludes\nthat it is best to stay with its current framework, the review will have served the Committee well and may\nindicate some ways we can further improve our monetary policy transparency and communication.\n\nSome Alternative Frameworks\nI will end my remarks by briefly noting some alternative frameworks that could be assessed as part of a\nreview. I will not have time to discuss their strengths and weaknesses at length, but I can give you a\nflavor. 10\n\nHigher Inflation Target\nOne alternative is to keep the flexible inflation-targeting framework but set a higher longer-run inflation\ntarget, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent. 11 This would be a familiar arrangement but give the nominal\nrate more of a cushion from hitting the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. But does the gain\nfrom more likely avoiding the zero lower bound when a negative shock hits outweigh the costs of running\na higher level of inflation at all times? Will it be easy to raise inflation expectations after having\n\n10\n\nSee Mester (2018) for further discussion of monetary policy frameworks and their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n11\n\nSee Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) for discussion.\n\n\f6\nsuccessfully anchored them at 2 percent? Is 4 percent inflation seen as consistent with price stability?\nThese questions will need to be answered.\n\nPrice-Level Targeting and Nominal GDP Targeting\nPrice-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting involve targeting a path for the nominal level rather than\na growth rate. Unlike inflation targeting, which lets bygones-be-bygones, these level-targeting\nframeworks make up for past deviations from the path. 12 For example, when inflation has been running\nlow, price-level targeting builds in a form of forward commitment to higher inflation in the future and a\n“low for longer” interest rate strategy. In theory, this can move current inflation expectations up, buoying\ncurrent inflation and limiting the time the economy spends at the zero lower bound. 13 There is little\ninternational experience with these frameworks and there are measurement issues to contend with: the\nstarting point for the path matters, data revisions would be more serious because these frameworks do not\nlet bygones-be-bygones, and to know what inflation will be along the nominal GDP path, one needs a\nreliable estimate of potential real output growth. 14,15 There are also credibility issues. Is it credible that\npolicymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even when demand is growing\nstrongly or that they will tighten policy when demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price\nlevel?\n\n12\n\nThe academic literature suggests that a price-level-targeting framework may approximate optimal monetary policy\nwhen policymakers want to minimize fluctuations in the output gap and in inflation around a target, and it can be\nparticularly useful at the zero lower bound by putting upward pressure on inflation expectations and, thereby,\ndownward pressure on the real rate. See Kahn (2009) for an accessible discussion of price-level targeting.\n\n13\n\nSee Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n\n14\n\nSweden did price-level targeting for less than two years when it went off the gold standard in 1931. See Kahn\n(2009).\n15\n\nFigure 1 in Mester (2018) shows four different starting points for the price-level path: the first quarters of 1990,\n1995, 2001, and 2007. If the starting point is 1990Q1, the price level is essentially on its path, and if the starting\npoint is 2001Q1, it is near its path. The other two starting points show a larger gap.\n\n\f7\nTemporary Price-Level Targeting\nFormer Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has suggested a temporary price-level-targeting framework, which\ninvolves targeting inflation in normal times but switching to price-level targeting once the policy rate has\nfallen to the zero lower bound. 16 Policymakers would revert to inflation targeting and begin to raise\ninterest rates once the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound was hit had risen\nsustainably back to target. This framework might be easy to communicate because it could be discussed\nsolely in terms of the inflation goal; however, determining and communicating the timing of when to\nswitch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex.\n\nSummary\nA review of monetary policy frameworks should consider these alternatives, as well as others. The goal\nwould be to assess which framework would make monetary policy the most effective at achieving its\ngoals, given the current and future economic environment, and whether any changes to the current\nframework could enhance monetary policy communications, credibility, and transparency.\n\n16\n\nBernanke (2017).\n\n\f8\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Temporary Price-Level Targeting: An Alternative Framework for Monetary Policy,”\nBen Bernanke’s Blog, The Brookings Institution, October 12, 2017.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/10/12/temporary-price-level-targeting-analternative-framework-for-monetary-policy/)\nBlanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro, “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,”\nJournal of Money, Credit and Banking 42(s1), 2010, pp. 199-215.\n(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00334.x/full)\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary\nPolicy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139-233.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-zero-bound-on-interest-rates-and-optimal-monetary-policy/)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 2014,” April 2014.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 30-31, 2018,” February 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180131.pdf)\nFOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” adopted effective January 24,\n2012; as amended effective January 30, 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nGovernment Affairs Breakfast Series\nDayton Area Chamber of Commerce\nDayton, OH\n\nFebruary 13, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak at today’s breakfast. Yesterday\nI had the opportunity to meet with several community organizations and to tour several Dayton\nneighborhoods. As I’m sure you know, we analyze a lot of data at the Fed. But augmenting the\neconomic and financial statistics by getting out and about in the Fourth District gives me a better sense of\nwhat is happening in the economy in real time. Nothing provides a more powerful reminder that Federal\nReserve policy affects real people and local communities. They say that all politics is local. In a sense,\nmonetary policy is, too. Although we set a national monetary policy, the local information we gather\nfrom contacts around the country allows those policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the\nAmerican economy and its people. The Fed’s regional structure, with 12 Reserve Banks distributed\nacross the country, overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., supports us in this work.\nThe information we get in the field helps us evaluate economic developments, formulate an outlook, and\nultimately make better policy decisions.\n\nToday, I will provide my assessment of economic developments, and my outlook for the economy and\nmonetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\nLet me start with an issue that is on everybody’s mind: what’s going on in financial markets? The past\nweek or so has been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs in the stock market, with a sudden increase in\nvolatility. Longer-term bond rates have also moved up. It’s helpful to put this into perspective. Equity\nmarkets had generally been on a sizable upswing over the past year, with the S&P 500 index up 19\npercent in 2017, amidst extremely low volatility. While some commentators thought that the low level of\ninterest rates and high earnings prospects supported high stock market valuations, others thought that\nequity prices had begun to outpace earnings, that bond yields were too low given the economic outlook,\n\n\f2\nand that a correction was waiting to happen, it was just a matter of time. Of course, it is investors, not\ncommentators, who determine prices and yields. Even with the recent movements, as of Friday, the\nS&P 500 index is still significantly higher than it was a year ago. Bond yields are at levels seen at the\nstart of 2014.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. In the near term,\nwe look at whether the market swing is accompanied by disorderly trading, a lack of liquidity, or\ncontagion to other markets. We have not seen this: trading has been relatively orderly, markets have\nremained generally liquid, and there hasn’t been a pullback in credit. We also assess whether there are\nspillovers to the broader economy that could affect the medium-run economic outlook. While a deeper\nand more persistent drop in equity markets could dash confidence and lead to a pullback in risk-taking\nand spending, the movements we have seen are far away from this scenario. I’ll continue to monitor\nfinancial market developments closely, but for now, I expect the economy will work through this episode\nof market turbulence and I have not changed my outlook. In my view, the underlying fundamentals\nsupporting the economy are very sound.\n\nFinancial conditions remain accommodative. Household and business balance sheets are healthy and\nincomes are growing. We’ve also seen improvement in the economies of many of our trading partners,\nwhich helps U.S. export growth. Monetary policy is accommodative and the changes in tax policy will\nalso have a positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, and I expect 2018 will be another good year for the\neconomy, with growth around 2-1/2 percent, which is stronger than my 2 percent estimate of trend\ngrowth. I anticipate that the tax package will add about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point to annual growth over\nthe next couple of years, but based on the positive reactions so far, there’s an upside risk that the effect\ncould be larger. Labor markets have been strong, and I expect that strength to continue, with above-trend\n\n\f3\nemployment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation has been\nrunning under 2 percent, but I expect it to gradually move up to our goal of 2 percent over the next one to\ntwo years.\n\nThe task before Fed policymakers is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy so that our\ncongressionally mandated long-run goals of maximum employment and price stability are met. This\nmeans making sure we don’t get behind the curve given the economy’s strength but also making sure we\ndon’t overreact to the positive outlook. To my mind, that means if economic conditions evolve as\nexpected, we’ll need to make some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace\nsimilar to last year’s. I think this gradual approach is the best strategy for sustaining the expansion and\nbalancing the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThat’s a summary of my outlook, which is informed by economic information, so let’s review some of\nthat now.\n\nEconomic growth\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent from a moderate annual pace of about 2 percent\nover the prior years of the expansion. Consumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output,\nshowed strength last year and my outlook is that it will remain healthy. Personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor market conditions are strong. In addition, household balance sheets are in much better\nshape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. Even\nafter the recent downturn in stock prices, increases in stock prices and house prices over the past year\nhave contributed to a rise in household wealth in the aggregate. In fact, the housing equity held by\nhouseholds is now above its peak before the housing crash.\n\n\f4\nThe recovery in housing took some time to gain traction. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were\nall wary about re-entering the market because of the fallout from the housing bust. But low interest rates\nand the improved financial condition of households and lenders have led to increased construction and\nsales. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nThe pickup in business investment last year was a welcome development. Investment was weak in 2015\nand 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy and\nmanufacturing sectors. Last year, conditions improved: oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the\neconomies of our trading partners began to strengthen. For the first time in many years, growth around\nthe world is picking up and forecasts for global growth are being revised up. This has a positive feedback\neffect on the U.S. economy via exports. In the U.S., business sentiment is high, our business contacts are\nreporting increasing demand, and national and regional surveys show rising levels of activity and orders\nin the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Last year, the economy added over 2\nmillion jobs, about 180 thousand per month. In January, payroll jobs rose by 200 thousand. This pace of\njob growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per\nmonth. The unemployment rate is now 4.1 percent. This is seven-tenths of a percentage point lower than\nit was a year ago and below its lowest point during the last expansion. It is well below the range most\neconomists associate with full employment, including my own estimate of 4-3/4 percent. Other\nindicators, including broader measures of unemployment, the job openings rate, and the job turnover rate,\nshow that the labor market is strong. I expect this strength to continue and that the unemployment rate\nwill move down below 4 percent this year.\n\n\f5\nDayton has also benefited from an improving job market. After peaking at just over 12 percent after the\nGreat Recession, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5 percent. Over the past year, payrolls have\ngrown at a brisk 2-3/4 percent pace. This is quite a reversal, as Dayton has had its challenges. Over the\n2001-2007 expansion, the Dayton region lost over 5 percent of its payroll jobs, while jobs grew more than\n5 percent in the nation. During the Great Recession, payroll jobs fell about 8 percent here compared to 5\npercent in the nation. But things have improved. In the Dayton region, payrolls are up 10 percent since\nthe start of the expansion, an increase of about 35 thousand jobs.\n\nSome of the regional differences reflect differences in industry mix. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base\nremains the largest employer in the area. It added jobs during the recession and helped to cushion some\nof the job losses in other sectors. On the other hand, manufacturing employment has been on a longerterm downward trend, at both the regional and the national level, and compared to the nation,\nmanufacturing represents a relatively larger share of payroll jobs in the Dayton region. Even so, that\ndifference has narrowed over time as Dayton’s economy has been transitioning from one that is largely\ndependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is diversifying into health care and education.\nIn the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 19 percent of Dayton’s jobs and “eds and meds”\nrepresented about 13 percent. Those shares have now reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in\neds and meds has been 19 percent, while the share in manufacturing has been 11 percent. Regions that\nhave diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time, and effective leadership, like\nthat provided by the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, can help the region navigate this transition.\n\nAs both national and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts throughout the Fourth District\nhave been reporting for a while that they’ve had trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now\ncoming from a wide range of firms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill\noccupations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tightness in the labor market is gradually showing up\nin higher compensation. Earlier in the expansion compensation growth was under 2 percent; more\n\n\f6\nrecently, it has increased to over 2-1/2 percent. The latest employment report showed another pickup in\nwage growth. These increases are consistent with the increasing number of reports from firm contacts\nwho tell us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to attract and\nretain workers.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address,\nwe are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nInflation\nThe other part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent\ninflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. “Symmetric” means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling.\nThe inflation measures will vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent,\nbut we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time, but the recent news on inflation has been\npositive. Inflation moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil\nand import prices. Inflation readings were above 2 percent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent\npartly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans.\nSince the lows seen last summer, inflation has moved up. We will likely see higher inflation numbers\nonce the price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year measures. But just as we didn’t\noverreact to last summer’s weaker inflation readings, we shouldn’t overreact to these increases either.\nInstead, I remain focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation, and I anticipate that with the economy\ngrowing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to strengthen, inflation will gradually\nmove up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years.\n\n\f7\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations help to\nanchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business cycle.\nDuring the dark days of the Great Recession, the deep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could\nhave led to deflation – not just low inflation rates but actually falling prices. But deflationary conditions\ndid not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s expectations that prices would\nremain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal. The fact that\ninflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation will gradually move\nback to goal. But since inflation forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, I’ll keep evaluating my\ninflation forecast as the year progresses.1,2 I’ll also need to continue to evaluate the effects of the recent\nchanges in tax policy. So let me discuss fiscal policy before I turn to monetary policy.\n\nFiscal Policy\nI expect that the tax changes will increase spending and raise economic growth over the next couple of\nyears. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus\nfrom the tax changes; as I mentioned, I’m estimating an additional 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point of annual\ngrowth this year and next year, but there is some upside risk that the effects could be larger. The impact\non individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income, but in the aggregate, I\nexpect lower personal tax rates and higher standard deductions to spur some additional household\nspending. On the corporate side, lower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and\nintangibles should spur additional business spending to meet higher near-term demand, but how much\nremains to be seen. Except for firms in the tax consulting business, the majority of our business contacts\n1\n\nBased on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE\ninflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1 percentage point. (See Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error\nRanges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nDecember 12-13, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n2\n\nA significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f8\nhave told us that while they welcome lower tax rates, they aren’t planning to make significant changes to\ntheir capital or hiring plans as a result of the change in taxes. Instead, those firms planning to increase\nspending and hiring say those increases are driven by brighter sales prospects and stronger demand. At\nthe same time, some businesses attributed the firm-wide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the\nyear to the tax cuts, and others have taken the occasion to implement wage increases they had\ncontemplated for some time. Firms might also be expected to spend some of their tax savings on\nincreased dividends and share buybacks. I expect to have a better read on how households and firms are\nactually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nA stronger outlook for business spending and hiring is a welcome development because investment and\nlabor force growth are key determinants of productivity growth and productivity growth is a key\ndeterminant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and of living standards. The U.S. economy has\nbeen struggling with very low productivity growth during this expansion, on the order of only 1 percent.3\nThis is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions, and partially explains why wage growth has\nbeen relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor markets. In addition, as a result of lower population\ngrowth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5\npercent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected\nto remain near that level over the next decade.4\n\nI expect some increase in productivity growth as the expansion continues. It is possible that the tax\nchanges could spur higher labor force participation and investment in physical and human capital, thereby\nhaving a positive effect on the economy’s productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend\n3\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n4\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Economic\nProjections – 2016-26,” October 24, 2017, p. 2 (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf).\n\n\f9\ngrowth rate. But these effects from the tax changes are even more difficult to estimate than the effects on\nnear-term spending, and they would play out over a longer period of time. So I have not incorporated\nthem into my own projection for longer-run growth, which I put at 2 percent.\n\nAnother aspect of fiscal policy that needs to be considered is its effect on the longer-run budget deficit.\nBefore the tax package and recently passed federal budget deal, projected longer-run fiscal imbalances\nwere unlikely to be sustainable.5 Were the trend growth rate not to pick up, lower tax revenues and\nhigher federal spending would add to the deficit relative to GDP, making it even more likely that the\ngovernment would eventually need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced or\nrestructured benefits, and increased taxes, thereby reducing any long-run positive effects of the recent\nchanges in fiscal policy. We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes not only as the\nyear progresses but into the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to monetary policy. At its January meeting, the FOMC maintained the target range for the\nfed funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This range was set in December, which saw the fifth increase in\nrates since December 2015, when the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy\naccommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. In January,\nthe FOMC also continued to implement its plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.6 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to\n\n5\n\nFor further discussion, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,”\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November\n16, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-theirimplications-for-the-economy-and-policy.aspx).\n6\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n\n\f10\npurchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in\n2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\nThe normalization plan, which began last October and will take several years to complete, involves letting\nmaturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to gradually roll off the\nbalance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in\nassets allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on\nsetting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The ultimate\nsize of the balance sheet will depend on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the\nfuture, a decision that has not yet been made.7\n\nI supported implementing the balance-sheet normalization plan and the December and January decisions\non interest rates. If the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be\nappropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s. I believe this gradual upward path of\ninterest rates will help balance the risks and prolong the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price\nstability and maximum employment are met and maintained. This policy path gives inflation time to\nmove back to goal while, at the same time, avoiding a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that\ncould arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, with the Fed then having to raise rates sharply in\nresponse. It helps avoid a build-up of risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates\nencourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. And it puts monetary\npolicy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are\nultimately realized.\n7\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f11\n\nOf course, this is my current view of monetary policy. We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to\nhow the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen\nthe path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower. But this is normal\nmonetary-policy-setting behavior – we will calibrate our policy based on the outlook and the realized and\nexpected progress on our dual-mandate monetary policy goals.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nVantage Point: Economists on the Economy Series\nThe Council for Economic Education\nNew York, NY\nJanuary 18, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Nan Morrison, president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education, for inviting me to\nspeak this evening, and I thank Nan and Barry Haimes, chairman of the board, for inviting me to join the\nboard of the CEE. The CEE’s vision is to teach every child in America about personal finance and\neconomics, and the Council offers abundant resources to help teachers do just that. The Federal Reserve\nSystem also supports economic education as part of our mission to engage in our communities. The\nCleveland Fed’s Learning Center and Money Museum offers various programs for teachers and students\nwith the goal of increasing financial and economic literacy. What we have learned over the years is that\nwhen people have a better understanding of the economy, they can make better financial decisions and be\npart of the national discourse on the important economic policy choices facing the country.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers are also in the economic education business. One of our tasks is to explain\nour views on the economy and monetary policy to the public. When they understand the rationale for our\npolicy decisions, people can hold us accountable for those decisions. But in addition, our policy is more\neffective when people understand how policy is likely to react to changes in the economic outlook. So\nI’m very happy to have this opportunity to talk about the economy and monetary policy. Let me remind\nyou that the views I’ll provide today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System\nor my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe economic expansion is 8-1/2 years long and counting. It is now the third longest on record. But\nlooking at it this way is a little misleading. Remember, the economy had to dig out of a very deep hole\nafter the financial crisis and Great Recession. So it took quite a long time for the labor market to heal and\nthe expansion to gain traction. Now labor markets are strong and economic growth picked up to around\n2-1/2 percent last year, compared to the 2 percent pace seen over much of the expansion. This is about a\nquarter of a percentage point stronger than I expected at the beginning of last year. So the economy is\n\n\f2\ncoming into 2018 with positive momentum, and for the first time in a while, there are some more salient\nupside risks to the forecast.\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economy are very sound. Monetary policy and financial\nconditions are accommodative. Household and business balance sheets continue to improve, and incomes\nare growing. In addition, conditions in the economies of many of our trading partners are improving.\nYou’ll notice that I haven’t said anything yet about the recently passed tax package. The reduction in\nbusiness and personal taxes will likely also have some positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nOverall, I expect 2018 to be a good year for the economy. My own expectation is that output growth will\nbe around 2-1/2 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I anticipate that fiscal policy will\nadd about ¼ to ½ percentage points to growth over the next couple of years. There’s an upside risk that\nthe effect could be larger. I expect labor markets will remain strong this year, with above-trend\nemployment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation ended up\nlast year slightly lower than I thought it would at the start of the year, but I anticipate it will gradually\nmove up to 2 percent over the next one to two years.\n\nThe goals of monetary policy, given to us by Congress, are to promote maximum employment and price\nstability. The task before us is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy, so that the economic\nexpansion is sustained. In my view, this means that if the economy evolves as I anticipate, we’ll need to\nmake some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s.\nThat’s a summary of my outlook, but let me give you some context so you’ll see how I got there.\n\nEconomic growth\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on\naverage. But last year, after a weak first quarter, growth picked up to an average pace of around 3 percent\n\n\f3\nover the remainder of the year. This pickup came in the midst of a severe hurricane season that caused a\nlot of damage in parts of the country. Growth was relatively balanced across sectors. Earlier in the\nexpansion, while consumer spending was relatively good, business spending was weak, and net exports\nwere a drag on growth. Last year, all three sectors made positive contributions, as did residential housing.\nThis balance should help to sustain the expansion going forward.\n\nAs I mentioned, I expect real GDP will grow at an above-trend 2-1/2 percent pace this year. Consumer\nspending makes up over two-thirds of output and the outlook for consumers remains sound. Spending\nduring the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, was healthy. Readings on consumer sentiment\nand confidence remain high, but even more important for spending, personal incomes are growing\nbecause labor market conditions are strong. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the\nGreat Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. The increases in stock\nprices and house prices over the past year have contributed to a rise in wealth in the household sector in\nthe aggregate. Although not true for every homeowner, the equity that households as a group have in\nhousing has risen above its previous peak before the housing crash.\n\nThis housing recovery has taken some time, but activity has picked up in recent months. Buyers, sellers,\ndevelopers, and bankers were all wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout\nfrom the housing bust. But low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and\nlenders have led to increased construction and sales. Rebuilding after the hurricanes and fires in\nCalifornia will also add to construction activity for a time. In some places, demand for housing is\noutpacing supply and house prices are accelerating. They are rising at between 6 and 7 percent, on\naverage, nationally. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable\npace.\n\n\f4\nBusiness investment has also picked up and this is a welcome development. Investment was weak in\n2015 and 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy\nand manufacturing sectors. But conditions improved last year. Oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated\nas the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen. In fact, for the first time in many years,\ngrowth around the world is picking up. Business sentiment remains at high levels, and our business\ncontacts in manufacturing and services report increasing demand, consistent with readings from national\nand regional business surveys.\n\nLabor markets\nThe labor market is strong. Last year, the economy added over 2 million jobs, about 170 thousand per\nmonth, and the unemployment rate fell by six-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.1 percent. The pace of\njob growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per\nmonth. The unemployment rate is below the lowest level reached during the last expansion; it is well\nbelow the range most economists associate with full employment; and it is below the 4.3-5.0 percent\nrange that FOMC participants project for the unemployment rate over the longer run.1 In addition, the\nbroader measure of the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those working parttime who would prefer full-time jobs is near its pre-Great Recession low, and other labor market\nindicators like job openings and turnover rates indicate a strong labor market. I expect this strength to\ncontinue and that the unemployment rate will move down further, ending the year at slightly under 4\npercent. This is low by historical standards and well below my current estimate of its longer-run rate,\nwhich I put at 4-3/4 percent.\n\n1\n\nSee Minutes of the FOMC Meeting of December 12-13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20171213.htm).\n\n\f5\nWe continue to hear from a wide range of firms that labor market conditions are tight and businesses are\nfinding it hard to find workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Wages have\naccelerated from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-1/2 percent more recently. That\nstrikes some people as a rather modest acceleration given the tightness in labor markets, but it is\nconsistent with the low level of productivity growth we’ve seen over this expansion.2 Our business\ncontacts are increasingly reporting that they are responding to labor shortages by increasing wages and\noffering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases should eventually find their way into\nthe aggregate compensation measures.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can\naddress, we are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate.\nOne might ask, what’s wrong with low unemployment? An unemployment rate below what is sustainable\ncan be a positive in the short run by bringing in workers from the sidelines of the labor market, but over\ntime, it can be a negative by creating bottlenecks, lowering productivity growth, and putting upward\npressure on inflation, which might require a policy response.\n\nInflation\nConsistent with meeting the price stability part of its mandate, the FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2\npercent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The 2 percent inflation goal isn’t a ceiling. The inflation measures\nwill vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep\ninflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n2\n\nAlthough actual wage setting is a complicated process, in economic models of competitive markets, real wages\nreflect the marginal product of workers. For a discussion of wages and their relationship to productivity growth over\nthe expansion, see Pinheiro, Roberto and Yang, Meifeng, “Wage Growth after the Great Recession,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Commentary, March 21, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-andevents/publications/economic-commentary/2017-economic-commentaries/ec-201704-wage-growth-after-greatrecession.aspx).\n\n\f6\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time. Inflation moved up from the very low levels\nseen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. Inflation readings were above 2\npercent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent partly due to special factors, like the drop in the\nprices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. Toward the end of the year, inflation readings\nshowed some stability, but inflation ended the year at 1-3/4 percent, below our goal.\n\nI anticipate that with the economy growing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to\nstrengthen, inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two\nyears. Stable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations\nhelp to anchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business\ncycle. During the dark days of the Great Recession, the collapse in demand could have led to deflation –\nnot only low inflation rates but actually falling prices – because the pullback in activity was so deep. But\ndeflationary conditions did not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people’s\nexpectations that prices would remain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return\nto goal. The fact that inflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation\nwill gradually move back to goal. Of course, I also recognize that inflation forecasts – including my own\n– are subject to a lot of uncertainty.3,4 In determining appropriate monetary policy, we’ll need to keep\nevaluating the inflation forecast as the year moves on. We’ll also need to evaluate the effects of the\nrecent changes in tax policy, which are part of the economic environment. So let me discuss fiscal policy\nbefore I turn to monetary policy.\n3\n\nBased on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE\ninflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1 percentage point. (See Table 2: “Average Historical Projection Error\nRanges,” in the Summary of Economic Projections portion of the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nDecember 12-13, 2017 (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n4\n\nA significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.\nSee Yellen, Janet, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” remarks delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial\nLecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/yellen20150924a.pdf).\n\n\f7\nFiscal Policy\nI expect that the recently enacted tax changes will have a positive effect on economic growth over the\nnext couple of years. It is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus;\nI’m estimating an additional ¼ to ½ percentage point of growth this year and next, but there is some\nupside risk that the effects could be larger. While the impact on individual households will depend on the\nlevel and sources of their income, in the aggregate, lower personal tax rates and higher standard\ndeductions are expected to spur some additional household spending. On the corporate side, lower tax\nrates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business\nspending to meet higher near-term demand, but how much remains to be seen. The majority of our\nbusiness contacts have told us that while they welcome lower tax rates, they aren’t planning to make\nsignificant changes to their capital or hiring plans as a result of the change in taxes. Instead, those firms\nplanning to increase spending and hiring say the increases are being driven by brighter sales prospects and\nthe pickup in activity in the second half of last year. At the same time, some businesses attributed the\nfirm-wide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the year to the tax cuts, and others have taken the\noccasion to implement wage increases they had contemplated for some time.\n\nA stronger outlook for business spending and hiring is a welcome development. In addition to having a\npositive effect on near-term demand, if lower taxes spur higher labor force participation, investment in\nphysical and human capital, research and development, and innovation, the tax package could also have a\npositive effect on the economy’s productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend growth rate.\nProductivity growth is a key determinant of an economy’s longer-run output growth and of living\nstandards. The U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth during this\nexpansion, on the order of only 1 percent.5 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions,\n\n5\n\nLabor productivity as measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector has averaged 1 percent\nover this expansion.\n\n\f8\nand partially explains why wage growth has been relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor\nmarkets. In addition, as a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of\nthe U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to\naround 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next\ndecade.6\n\nWhile I expect some increase in productivity growth as the expansion continues, the effects of changes in\ntax policy on productivity growth and labor force participation are even more difficult to estimate than\ntheir effects on near-term spending, and they would play out over a longer period of time. So I have not\nincorporated them into my own projection for longer-run growth, which I put at 2 percent.\n\nAnother aspect of the tax package that needs to be considered is its effect on the longer-run budget deficit.\nBefore the tax package, projected longer-run fiscal imbalances were unlikely to be sustainable.7 Were the\ntrend growth rate not to pick up, lower tax revenues would add to the deficit relative to GDP, making it\neven more likely that the government would need to respond with some combination of increased\nborrowing, reduced or restructured benefits, and increased taxes, thereby reducing any long-run benefits\nof the tax package. We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes as the year\nprogresses and into the future.\n\n6\n\nAccording to the latest available projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that annual growth in\nthe labor force over 2016-2026 will average 0.6 percent. See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Economic\nProjections – 2016-26,” October 24, 2017, p. 2 (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecopro.pdf).\n7\n\nFor further discussion, see Mester, Loretta J., “Demographics and Their Implications for the Economy and Policy,”\nCato Institute’s 35th Annual Monetary Conference: The Future of Monetary Policy, Washington, D.C., November\n16, 2017 (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20171116-demographics-and-theirimplications-for-the-economy-and-policy.aspx).\n\n\f9\nMonetary Policy\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate by one-quarter\npercentage point to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This was the fifth increase in rates since December 2015,\nwhen the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was\nnecessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nIn October, the Fed began implementing the plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and\ncomposition of assets.8 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to\npurchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed’s balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in\n2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The\ncomposition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\nThe normalization plan, which will take several years to complete, involves letting maturing Treasuries\nand principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a\nmonthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in assets allows balancesheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level\nof the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The ultimate size of the balance sheet will\ndepend on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future, a decision that has not yet\nbeen made.9\n\n8\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n9\n\nFor an accessible description of frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see Ihrig, Jane E., Meade, Ellen\nE., and Weinbach, Gretchen C., “Rewriting Monetary Policy 101: What’s the Fed’s Preferred Post-Crisis Approach\nto Raising Interest Rates?” Journal of Economic Perspectives 29 (Fall 2015), pp. 177-198\n(http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.4.177).\n\n\f10\nI supported implementing the balance-sheet normalization plan and the December decision to raise rates.\nIf the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this\nyear and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s.\n\nBased on my medium-run outlook, I believe this gradual upward path of interest rates will help balance\nthe risks and prolong the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum\nemployment are met and maintained. This policy path gives inflation time to move back to goal while, at\nthe same time, avoiding a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is\nallowed to overheat, with the Fed then having to raise rates sharply in response. It helps avoid a build-up\nof risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively\nrisky investments in a search for yield. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address\nwhatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nOf course, this is my current view of monetary policy. We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to\nhow the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run\noutlook and risks around the outlook. If you think this sounds like normal monetary policy-setting\nbehavior, you’re right – a positive sign that the economy is finally back to normal.\n\n\f"

        "content": "The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy Communications\n\nLoretta J. Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Tangri Lecture\nRutgers University\nNew Brunswick, NJ\nJanuary 17, 2018\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\nI thank Tom Prusa, chair of the economics department, and Professor Joe Hughes for inviting me to\npresent the Tangri Lecture. It is an honor for me to be with you today. I’d also like to take the\nopportunity to thank Joe for our research collaboration, which has spanned many years – probably more\nthan we care to admit. Joe is a wonderful co-author, and he often tells me of the innovative techniques he\nis bringing to the classroom, so I would venture to say he is a dedicated and highly effective teacher as\nwell.\n\nThis afternoon I will speak about the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the value of clear\nmonetary policy communications. I’ll summarize some of the improvements the Fed has made to its\ncommunications, and then offer my recommendation for potential next steps. Of course, my remarks will\nreflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\nBefore we can discuss monetary policy communications, it’s important to have a sense of the structure of\nthe Federal Reserve System.\n\nAfter a period of financial instability, Congress established the Fed in 1913 to promote the health of the\nU.S. economy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public interest as a\ndecentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent from the\ngovernment. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by financial\ninterests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the design includes representation from\nacross the country and balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street\nconcerns.\n\n\f2\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United\nStates and confirmed by the Senate. Governors serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. These terms\nspan several terms of the president and members of Congress, which is intended to insulate the governors\nfrom short-term political influence and allows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting\nmonetary and financial regulatory policy. The chair and vice chair of the Board of Governors, and the\ngovernor who serves as vice chair of supervision, a position created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are\nchosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year\nterms. The chair and vice chairs can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic\nactivity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine\nmembers are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing\nbusiness, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors\nare responsible for choosing a Reserve Bank’s president, who is subject to approval of the Fed’s Board of\nGovernors.\n\nThis regional structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows monetary policy\ndecisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people, and also helps us to\ncarry out our other responsibilities. These include supervising and regulating banks and other important\nfinancial institutions, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing\nthe nation’s payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying\n\n1\n\nSome Reserve Banks also have Branches. For example, the Cleveland Fed has a Branch in Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, and a Branch in Cincinnati, Ohio. Each Branch of a Reserve Bank has a board of directors with five\nor seven members.\n\n\f3\neffective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access\nto credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the body within the Fed that is responsible for setting\nmonetary policy. It holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington, D.C. The FOMC\nwas established by the Banking Act of 1935 and has 12 members: the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a\nrotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, rotating my vote with the\npresident of the Chicago Fed. Other than New York, Cleveland, and Chicago, the other presidents vote\nevery third year. I am a voting member this year, but it’s important to note that all presidents, whether\nvoting or nonvoting, participate in FOMC meetings.\n\nSo the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all\nparts of the country. And this regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis,\nplays an important part in the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our goals.\n\nThose monetary policy goals were given to the Fed by Congress. The Federal Reserve Act says that the\nFed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable\nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” When prices are stable and the economy is at maximum\nemployment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that Congress has\ngiven the Fed a dual mandate.\n\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making\nmonetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This means monetary policy decisions do not have to\nbe approved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual\n\n\f4\npractice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political\ninterference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nBut independence does not mean that the Fed should be unaccountable for its monetary policy decisions\nor that it shouldn’t be transparent about the rationale for those decisions. In fact, accountability must go\nhand in hand with independence or else independence from the political process won’t be sustainable.\nBecause it takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, the public won’t be able to\nimmediately see whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to\nexplain their decisions, their assessment of economic conditions, and their outlook for the economy. In\nother words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\nOne important benefit of clear communication is that it can actually make monetary policy more effective\nby helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. The public will\nhave a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals,\nthose aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can’t influence, and the economic information that\ninfluences their forecasts and policy decisions. And when policymakers strive to be systematic in their\npolicy responses to changes in economic conditions that influence the outlook, the public will have a\nbetter idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. They will have a\nbetter sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to\nunanticipated economic developments. With such knowledge, households and firms can plan better; they\ncan make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions. In addition, when the public\nhas a clearer understanding of the strategy monetary policymakers follow in normal times, they will also\nunderstand when nonstandard monetary policy action is required in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\f5\nIndeed, in extraordinary times, like the financial crisis and deep recession we’ve lived through, policy\ncommunications not only provide transparency but they can also serve as a monetary policy tool. In\nparticular, once interest rates hit their effective zero lower bound, providing forward guidance about the\npath that policy will likely follow in the future has the potential to increase the current degree of monetary\npolicy accommodation. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance helps\nlower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate\nuncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest\nrates will be low for a long time – lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central\nbank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby adding\naccommodation and spurring current economic activity. In theory, if people believe that the central bank\nis committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher\ninflation in the future and that will induce them to make investments in capital and labor today, thereby\nhelping the current economy.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks used forward guidance as a tool during the Great Recession. The Fed’s\nforward guidance took several forms. First, it was qualitative: the FOMC indicated in December 2008\nthat it anticipated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the\nfed funds rate for “some time.” In March 2009, “some time” became an “extended period.” In August\n2011, this qualitative forward guidance changed to calendar-date guidance when the FOMC said it\nanticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through mid-2013. That date was later extended to\nlate 2014, and then to mid-2015. In December 2012, calendar-date guidance was changed to statecontingent guidance when the FOMC said that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the\nfed funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent,\ninflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point\nabove the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be\nwell anchored. Some form of this threshold guidance was used until March 2014. Since then, as the\n\n\f6\neconomy has returned to normal and policy is normalizing, the FOMC has been providing information\nabout the factors that will influence the future path of policy, but this is in the realm of regular policy\ncommunication conveying a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react to economic developments rather\nthan guidance as a policy tool.\n\nSteps the FOMC Has Taken to Enhance Monetary Policy Communications\nOver the past couple of decades, as the benefits of enhanced transparency have become better\nappreciated, the Federal Reserve has taken several steps to enhance its regular policy communications. I\nbelieve we’ve made substantial progress, although I also believe that achieving clearer monetary policy\ncommunications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a destination and we should always be\nworking to make our communications more effective.\n\nSome commentators have criticized the Fed for being, perhaps, a bit too transparent – with a cacophony\nof Fed voices speaking too many times. So it might surprise you to know that it wasn’t until 1994 that the\nFOMC began explicitly announcing changes in its targeted policy rate, the fed funds rate. Before 1994,\nthere was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC decided by looking\nat how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets. Now, the postmeeting statement describes the FOMC’s view of the state of the economy and the rationale for its\ndecisions. Since 2002, the statement has also included the votes of individual members and the preferred\npolicy choices of any dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes.\nBefore 2005, these minutes weren’t released until after the subsequent FOMC meeting. Now they are\nreleased with only a three-week lag. Recently, the FOMC used the minutes to convey information about\nthe strategies it was considering for normalizing the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. 2 By\n\n2\n\nSee FOMC, “Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” as adopted effective June 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf), FOMC,\n“Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 14-15, 2017,” April 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170315.pdf), and FOMC, “Minutes of the\n\n\f7\nthe time it was announced in June 2017, the plan was well understood by market participants. In addition\nto minutes, the FOMC publishes a full transcript of each meeting with a five-year lag.\n\nAn important enhancement to monetary policy communications was the FOMC’s statement on longer-run\ngoals and monetary policy strategy, adopted in January 2012 and reviewed and reaffirmed each year\nsince. 3 This statement laid out for the first time the guiding principles the FOMC uses in setting\nmonetary policy. It recognizes that over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and\nnot the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or\nmaximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in\nemployment from maximum employment. Importantly, the statement also established an explicit\nnumerical goal for inflation over the longer run. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by\nthe year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation.\nThe explicit target not only provides transparency to the public but it also underscores the FOMC’s\ncommitment to price stability, thereby helping to anchor expectations about inflation. Since inflation\nexpectations are an important determinant of actual inflation, having an explicit target helps promote\nprice stability.\n\nOutside of the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches\n– like this one – in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the\npublic. As I mentioned, sometimes this speaking is criticized, but as a public servant, I think it’s one of\nmy duties to explain my views. In addition to speeches, the chair testifies before subcommittees of both\nhouses of Congress at two regularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings\nwhen asked. And since 2011, the chair has held press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year.\nFederal Open Market Committee, May 2-3, 2017,” May 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170503.pdf).\n3\n\nSee FOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 31, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf).\n\n\f8\nThese briefings allow the chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC’s\nrelatively short post-meeting statement and to respond to questions from the media. The four meetings\nfollowed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic\nProjections, or SEP.\n\nThese projections, which are now quarterly, began in 2007. In ensuing years, the projections have been\nenhanced in various ways and I would expect us to consider further enhancements to the SEP over time,\nas part of our ongoing efforts to make our communications even more effective. The SEP now includes\nmore variables and a longer time horizon. The variables included are real output growth, the\nunemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation, that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which\ntend to be volatile. The projections also include participants’ anticipated path of appropriate policy given\ntheir outlook and their assessment of risks around the outlook. The projections are for the current year\nand for up to three additional years, and also provide participants’ longer-run estimates of key economic\nvariables. Most recently, the FOMC added confidence bands around the median projections across the\nparticipants.\n\nI view the addition of confidence bands as an important enhancement, because these bands illustrate in a\nsimple way the reasonable amount of variation to expect in forecasts and in outcomes relative to\nprojections. They remind us of the important message that the economy can evolve in unexpected ways.\nFor example, as shown in the latest SEP projections, 4 the 70 percent confidence interval around the\nmedian forecast of real GDP growth is about ±1.7 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0\npercentage points for each of the following two years; for inflation, it is about ±1.0 percentage point for\n\n4\n\nSee FOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf).\n\n\f9\neach of the next three years, and for the fed funds rate, it is about 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percentage points over the\nnext three years.\n\nThe Communications Challenge\nAccording to Voltaire, “Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.” In our\ncontext, this means it is important to remember that monetary policymakers have to deal with uncertainty,\nwhich takes several forms. The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that can lead economic\nconditions to evolve differently than anticipated. In addition, our view of current economic conditions\ncan be cloudy because many economic data are revised over time, and these data revisions complicate\nforecasting and setting monetary policy in real time. There is also model uncertainty: it isn’t clear which\nmodel will best predict the future path of the economy at any given time. One approach that I like is to\naverage across various models to develop a forecast, or to look at the forecasts from several different\nmodels and to analyze different scenarios. In speaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben\nBernanke said, “The only economic forecast in which I have complete confidence is that the economy\nwill not evolve along the precise path implied by our projections.” 5\n\nThe FOMC is not prescient, nor should anyone expect it to be. Yet, because policy affects the economy\nwith a lag, policymakers need to make medium-run forecasts and acknowledge the uncertainty. But this\nposes a fundamental communications challenge – how can policymakers be transparent about their\ncurrent assessment of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and their anticipated appropriate policy\npath without being perceived as having made a promise they won’t necessarily keep should the economy\nevolve in an unanticipated way. Added to this is the tendency for market participants, among others, to\nprefer more explicit statements and less uncertainty, and the potential that they will interpret the forecasts\n\n5\n\nSee Bernanke, Ben S., “Federal Reserve Communications,” Cato Institute 25th Annual Monetary Conference,\nWashington, D.C., November 14, 2007\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071114a.htm).\n\n\f10\nof the economy and the appropriate policy path as having more certitude than they actually do, which\ncreates communication issues when the forecasts and policy path change.\n\nI note that here I’m talking about normal times. In extraordinary times, for example, when interest rates\nhave reached the zero lower bound and policymakers want to run a policy of keeping interest rates very\nlow for longer than they otherwise would, the challenge is just the opposite – how can policymakers\ncredibly commit to such a policy path that differs from normal policy?\n\nPolicy Communications Recommendations\nI believe that to meet these challenges, we should focus our policy communications on conveying a better\nsense of the FOMC’s reaction function in normal times, that is, the relationship between changes in\nmonetary policy and changes in the economic outlook. This takes us away from having to predict the\nvarious shocks that may hit the economy, shocks that can arise from many different sources. Instead, we\nshould provide a better sense of how policy can be expected to react when there is a change in economic\nconditions and the medium-run outlook, whether those changes were anticipated or not. Of course,\npolicymakers do not necessarily agree on the precise form of the policy reaction function. Still, there is\nconsensus on some of the factors that should influence policy, including measures of the unemployment\nrate, employment growth, output growth, inflation, and longer-run inflation expectations.\n\nFrom a practical viewpoint, let me offer three suggestions of what the FOMC can do to create a better\nunderstanding of our policy reaction function.\n\nFirst, let’s ensure that our post-meeting FOMC statement focuses less on short-term changes in the data\nreleased between FOMC meetings and more on accumulated changes in economic and financial\nconditions and their effect on the medium-run outlook and progress toward our monetary policy goals.\nThe statement should help the public and financial market participants to better understand policymakers’\n\n\f11\nconsensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data. While the statement has been evolving in\nthis direction, I believe it could do more to dissuade people from thinking short term. The statement is a\nvery important part of FOMC communications. We could improve the public’s understanding of our\nmonetary policy reaction function if the statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how\nchanges in economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks\naround that outlook, and therefore, the appropriate policy path. In addition to the narrative, the statement\nwould describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken, and some information on the\nfuture path of policy. In extraordinary economic circumstances, this might be explicit forward guidance\nthat serves as a policy tool, as it did during the Great Recession and early part of the recovery. But during\nnormal times, the statement would, instead, provide a rationale for future policy decisions. It would\narticulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in\npolicy. If we provided more consistency about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the\nstance of policy, I believe the public and market participants would get a better sense of the Committee’s\nreaction function over time and their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers,\nthereby making policy more effective and, at least to some extent, reducing market volatility. What I’m\nsuggesting would likely not result in a shorter statement but, I believe, a more informative one.\n\nSecond, let’s begin using simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks to explain our policy decisions.\nYou can find updates for a set of seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland\nFed’s website, and the Federal Reserve Board’s Monetary Policy Report now includes a section on policy\nrules. 6 These types of rules describe policy reaction functions that have been shown to yield good\neconomic outcomes in some models and in some economic circumstances. I am not advocating setting\npolicy mechanically according to a simple policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of\n6\n\nSee “Simple Monetary Policy Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/ourresearch/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx) and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, “Monetary Policy Report,” July 7, 2017, pp. 24-28\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170707_mprfullreport.pdf).\n\n\f12\neconomic models and circumstances. However, using the rules as reference points and discussing why\nour policy may differ from these policy descriptions could go some way in helping to explain our own\npolicy reaction function to the public.\n\nThis doesn’t go as far as having the FOMC present a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for\nunderstanding the FOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements, a recommendation I’ve made in\nthe past. 7 The median paths in the SEP are somewhat of a step in that direction, but because the variables\nare not linked across participants, the median paths don’t really represent a coherent forecast. For\nexample, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be\nprojecting the median output path. In 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast\nrepresenting the consensus of the Committee, but it proved difficult to achieve. 8 In lieu of that, the\nFOMC should consider publishing the Board staff’s forecast as a benchmark against which policymakers\ncould explain how and why their forecasts may differ.\n\nThird, let’s link the variables in the SEP. As I just mentioned, right now, each variable in our projections\nis reported independently, so, for example, there is no way to see whether a person low in the range of\nunemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. The SEP could be enhanced by\nlinking the variables for each participant’s projection so that the public could see what each policymaker\nis projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes is\nappropriate given those projections. This could be done without revealing the identities of the\nparticipants and would convey information on each individual policymaker’s reaction function. We\nmight also consider other enhancements to help the public understand that the policy paths in the SEP are\n\n7\n\nSee Mester, Loretta J., “Acknowledging Uncertainty,” Shadow Open Market Committee Fall Meeting, New York,\nNY, October 7, 2016 (http://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20161007acknowledging-uncertainty.aspx).\n\n8\n\nSee the minutes and transcripts from the July, September, and October 2012 FOMC meetings\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2012.htm).\n\n\f13\nnot necessarily commitments but depend on how the economy evolves. Although this message may\nalready be understood because of the FOMC’s actions: last year, the economy evolved in a way that\nresulted in the FOMC raising the fed funds rate three times. This was consistent with the median\nprojection of FOMC participants in March 2017. However, in both 2015 and 2016, the FOMC raised the\nfunds rate fewer times than the median projection made in March of those years, clearly demonstrating\nthat when economic conditions evolve differently than anticipated, the FOMC will adjust policy\naccordingly.\n\nConclusion\nLet me end by noting that 14 years ago, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an\neconomic outlook speech. The next day’s headline in The New York Times read: “Greenspan Hints at End\nto Low Rates,” while the headline in The Wall Street Journal read: “Greenspan Suggests Continued\nPatience on Rates.” 9 That one speech generated such contradictory messages illustrates the challenges\nmonetary policymakers face when communicating with the public. I suspect that monetary policy\ncommunication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, but over the past couple of decades,\nthe FOMC has been taking significant steps on its journey toward increased transparency and better\ncommunication. It is important for the FOMC to continue on this journey because when the public has a\nbetter understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, not only will the public have the\ninformation it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions but monetary policy itself will be more\neffective. I have offered some concrete suggestions on how we might improve our communications by\nconveying a better sense of our policy reaction function. I expect the FOMC will continue to make\nprogress because the benefits of clearer communication are clearly worth the effort.\n\n9\n\nThese were the original headlines in the November 7, 2003 print editions.\n\n\f"

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks for the International Banking, Economics, and Finance Association and\nAmerican Economic Association Session,\n“Integrating Financial Stability with Monetary Policy”\nAllied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 6, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank Diana Hancock and Wayne Passmore for inviting me to speak today. I will use my time to\ndiscuss four topics: the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy, the Federal\nReserve’s current framework for assessing and monitoring financial stability risks, an exercise aimed to\nassess possible policy responses to such risk, and some of the governance issues we face in addressing\nthese risks. The views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Stability and Central Banks\nThe global financial crisis and the deep recession that followed were a rude awakening that much more\nneeded to be done to assess and address vulnerabilities in the financial system. In the U.S., significant\nresources have been brought to bear to improve financial system resiliency, both to lower the probability\nthat financial instability will arise and to limit the damage when financial shocks occur. Financial\nstability matters to central banks. One reason is that monetary policy affects the real economy by\naffecting financial conditions. During the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not\nfunctioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. Another reason\ncentral banks care about financial stability is that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ninterconnected. Indeed, the definition of financial stability is often framed in terms of a financial system\nthat is able to provide its valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and\nhouseholds in the face of economic and financial shocks. Disruptions to the financial system that could\ninterfere with its ability to provide these services include fire sales of assets, runs on financial firms,\nshortages of liquid assets, and contraction of credit in the face of unknown counterparty risk. We saw all\nof these during the global financial crisis.\n\nBecause central banks care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of the real\neconomy, volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic\n\n\f2\neconomy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something monetary policy should\nrespond to. In most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are\ncomplementary. For example, price stability helps businesses, households, and financial institutions\nmake better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial system. And a stable financial\nsystem allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. But in the\nshort run, at times there may be trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability, as\nmacroprudential actions may slow the economy for a while. If such actions are needed to maintain the\nstability of the financial system, then these actions would also foster the monetary policy goals of price\nstability and maximum employment over the medium run, and would be complementary to economic\ngrowth. 1\n\nThe first line of defense against financial instability should involve making the structure of the financial\nsystem more resilient. Structural resiliency is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital\n(including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity\nstandards, stress tests, living wills, effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and\nnonbank financial institutions, and reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets. The latter\ninclude changes to regulations governing money market mutual funds to reduce the chance of investor\nruns on these funds, rules requiring standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts to be cleared\nthrough central counterparties, and limiting interday credit exposures in the tri-party repo market. 2 In\ncontrast to structural tools, which apply regardless of the level of vulnerability, the countercyclical capital\n1\n\nOf course, even with an optimally designed regime to foster financial stability, there could be a trade-off between\nthe average level of economic growth over the longer run and the desired degree of financial system resilience,\nbecause risk-taking and risk management are at the heart of the financial system. Indeed, in the U.K., the Financial\nServices Act recognizes this potential trade-off and indicates that the act does not authorize the Financial Policy\nCommittee to operate in a way that the committee feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity\nof the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.” See U.K.\nFinancial Services Act 2012, Section 9C(4).\n2\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission implemented revisions to the regulations governing money market\nmutual funds in 2014 and 2016. The G20 countries agreed in 2009 that standardized over-the-counter derivatives\ncontracts should be cleared by central counterparties.\n\n\f3\nbuffer is an example of a cyclical tool that can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the\nfinancial system. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this tool only when systemic\nvulnerabilities are “meaningfully above normal” and that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the\nbuffer in a gradual way. 3 The U.S. has not had much experience with this tool, so the focus on increasing\nthe resiliency of the structure of the financial system seems well-founded.\n\nI believe monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum employment\nand not be given a third objective of financial stability. But I also recognize that monetary policy and\nfinancial stability goals and actions are interrelated and that if we assessed the risks to financial stability\nto be sufficiently great, achieving our dual-mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy. In\nthis situation, the distinction between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be blurry,\nand to the extent that financial instability affects macroeconomic stability, those using a risk-management\napproach to monetary policy might be compelled to act, even though financial stability is not an explicit\npart of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe FOMC recognizes these linkages. It has acknowledged that nonconventional monetary policy,\nincluding large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of essentially zero interest rates, could pose\npotential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and spurring risk-taking in a search\nfor yield. 4 One study using Spanish data found that a lower overnight policy rate induced low-capitalized\nbanks to lend more to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized\n\n3\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016). Other countries have used limits on loan-to-value\nratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary over the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or\nhousehold credit to control leverage. See Liang (2013) and Fischer (2014).\n4\n\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), p. 25.\n\n\f4\nbanks, direct evidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking. 5 The low-interest-rate environment has\nalso posed challenges for bank profitability. In addition, to the extent that asset valuations have been\nelevated relative to historical standards because of the low level of interest rates (which means a low\ndiscount rate), as interest rates rise, valuations might be expected to fall, which would pose some risks to\nfinancial stability. 6\n\nEffects also run in the reverse direction, from macroprudential policy to monetary policy: Tight\nmacroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood\nthat a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nSo when we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our\nmonetary policy actions and financial stability and we need to monitor financial system conditions and\ndevelopments as part of the economic environment. Well before the financial crisis, the FOMC discussed\nfinancial stability considerations at its meetings when setting monetary policy. 7 But since the financial\ncrisis, the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial\nstability surveillance is receiving regular attention at FOMC meetings. This regular attention is important\nbecause, as we learned during the financial crisis, even in periods when conditions look benign,\nvulnerabilities may be building.\n\n5\n\nJiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the Spanish credit registry\nand separately identify how a change in the monetary policy rate affects the demand for credit and the volume and\ncomposition of credit supplied, in particular, the supply to riskier borrowers.\n\n6\n7\n\nSee FSOC (2017) for further discussion.\n\nPeek, Rosengren, and Tootell’s (2015) textual analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings from 1982 through\n2009 suggests that the FOMC does consider financial stability when setting monetary policy.\n\n\f5\nThe Fed’s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks is described in\nAdrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015). The framework recognizes the complex nature of the financial\nsystem in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based finance and market-based finance and its multiplicity of\nregulatory and supervisory bodies. The framework is informed by experience during the financial crisis,\nas well as the theoretical and empirical literature on financial stability.\n\nThis literature demonstrates that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of financial\nmarket participants, and that it varies across the cycle. When the economy is performing well, collateral\nvalues increase, which supports further borrowing. Funding constraints fall, and with credit amply\navailable to borrowers, the volatility of output and the volatility of asset prices fall. This induces banks to\nincrease their leverage and lend even more. Leverage and maturity mismatch build up, the price of risk\nfalls, and asset values rise. But these developments mean the system is more vulnerable, so that when a\nnegative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, lenders become riskaverse, and credit contracts. This causes households and businesses to pull back on their spending, which\ndepresses output even further, thereby propagating the shock to the real economy.\n\nOn a conceptual level, the Fed’s framework is based on an understanding of these mechanisms through\nwhich shocks can be amplified and propagated throughout the financial system and to the real economy. 8\nThe framework tracks a standard set of financial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate\nshocks using a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures\n(reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity\n\n8\n\nImportant research on the propagation and amplification of shocks throughout the financial system includes\nKiyotaki and Moore (1997), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), and Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).\n\n\f6\ntransformation, and interconnectedness and complexity. Tools like heat maps and data-visualization\ntechniques aid in the tracking over time. 9\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the importance of assessing and monitoring risks more broadly than just\nin individual regulated banks, so these vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of the economy: the\nbanking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and shadow banks; the\nnonfinancial business sector; and the household sector.\n\nThe framework makes a distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities.10 Shocks are difficult to predict\nand arise from various sources, whereas vulnerabilities are characteristics of the financial system and\ndepend on the behavior of providers of financial services, their customers, and their regulators. Some of\nthese vulnerabilities, like leverage, vary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity,\nare more structural in nature, reflecting the design of markets and intermediaries.\n\nTo see the distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities, consider the financial crisis. Developments in\nthe subprime mortgage market constituted a shock that precipitated the crisis. Recall that, at the time,\nmany thought that the subprime market was too small to pose major problems in the financial system.\nThat view turned out to be terribly wrong because it failed to recognize both the interconnectedness\nacross markets and institutions and the fact that, at the time, the financial system was highly vulnerable to\na shock due to high leverage and reliance on short-term funding. The easing of underwriting standards\nand the demand for securitized subprime mortgage assets led to a build-up in leverage before the crisis.\nWhen house prices fell, losses on subprime mortgages were amplified because the loans were funded by\nshort-term funding sources, such as asset-backed commercial paper. Banks that sponsored these funds\n\n9\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n10\n\nSee Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015) and Bernanke (2012).\n\n\f7\nfelt compelled to support these vehicles, diverting funds from other types of lending; they pulled back on\nrisk because of the drop in the value of mortgages and other assets. The drop in the value of asset-backed\nsecurities caused problems in other markets, such as the repo market, where these assets were used as\ncollateral. Thus, leverage and reliance on short-term funding were vulnerabilities that allowed the\noriginal shock to propagate across the financial system, becoming amplified and wreaking much\ndestruction as it went. Another distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks is that, unlike with shocks,\nit is feasible that policies could be designed to limit the build-up of vulnerabilities, thereby promoting\nfinancial stability.\n\nUsing the framework helps the Fed be systematic in its analysis of the financial system’s vulnerability to\na range of possible shocks. Systematic analysis means we can better identify changes in vulnerabilities\nover time and compare the level of vulnerabilities to historical experience at similar stages of the business\ncycle. An assessment of individual vulnerabilities is then combined to get an assessment of the overall\nvulnerability of the financial system. For example, when asset valuations are high and leverage is high,\nthe financial system is likely more vulnerable to shocks because the combination can lead to rapid credit\ngrowth and excessive risk-taking that can reverse quickly when a negative shock hits.\n\nThe minutes of the FOMC meetings indicate the types of discussions of financial conditions that regularly\ntake place. At each meeting, the staff briefs the Committee on developments in financial markets over the\nintermeeting period. This discussion includes movements in equity prices; government and corporate\nbond yields; availability of credit to households and businesses; credit standards, loan growth, and\nfinancing conditions in various sectors, including the business, consumer, and residential and commercial\nreal estate sectors; conditions in short-run funding markets; foreign exchange movements; and financial\nconditions abroad. At every other meeting, the staff reports on its assessment of the vulnerabilities in the\nU.S. financial system, discussing how the vulnerabilities have changed since the last report and over time.\n\n\f8\nRecognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the staff has developed tools to assess\nforeign financial stability as well. 11\n\nAn evaluation of developments related to financial stability and the assessment of the financial system’s\nvulnerabilities have also become a regular section in the Board of Governors’ monetary policy report.\nThe report occasionally includes additional in-depth information on particular sectors. For example, the\nlatest report included a section discussing liquidity in the corporate bond market. 12 Although market\nparticipants had been expressing concerns about reduced liquidity in the market, the Board’s analysis\nsuggested that liquidity strains in the market were minimal. And as a member of the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC), the Federal Reserve contributes to the FSOC’s annual report that identifies\npotential risks to financial stability and makes recommendations about what can be done to mitigate those\nrisks. 13\n\nThe Fed has made a lot of progress on building a system to monitor and assess changes in the financial\nsystem’s vulnerabilities. Analysis suggests that the vulnerabilities now being tracked had, indeed, been\nbuilding up for several years before the onset of the financial crisis.14 As discussed in the minutes of the\nOctober FOMC meeting, the Fed staff assessed that overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system\nremained moderate. Valuation pressures were elevated but vulnerabilities stemming from leverage in the\nnonfinancial sector were moderate; those stemming from leverage in the financial sector and from\nmaturity and liquidity mismatch remained low. The staff also assessed that overall vulnerabilities to\nforeign financial stability were moderate.\n\n11\n\nFor example, see FOMC (November 2017).\n\n12\n\nSee Board of Governors (July 2017).\n\n13\n\nSee FSOC (2017).\n\n14\n\nSee Aikman, et al. (2015a, 2015b).\n\n\f9\nOngoing work at the Fed continues to evaluate what changes in vulnerabilities may signal about financial\nstability and how policy should respond to signs of emerging financial stability risks and, in particular,\nhow financial stability concerns should be incorporated into monetary policymaking.\n\nA Financial Stability Tabletop Exercise\nIncluded in these efforts is the tabletop exercise that was undertaken by the Financial Stability\nSubcommittee of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve System in June 2015. 15 This\nexercise involved working through a plausible scenario of loose financial conditions, reflected by falling\nterm and risk premia, leading to pressures on valuations in the commercial property market and increasing\nleverage in the form of higher corporate debt issuance and leveraged lending that was funded by shortterm wholesale funding. The context included monetary policy that was gradually removing\naccommodation, as in 2015-2016, with inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal but the economy at\nfull employment. The scenario reflected some historical episodes of financial market instability,\nincluding the real estate boom and bust in New England in the mid-1980s and in Sweden in 1989-1990,\nbut with the incorporation of increased leverage in the nonfinancial sector, as well as in banking, and a\nfocus on commercial real estate as opposed to residential real estate.\n\nWithin this scenario, financial conditions were judged to be too loose given macroeconomic conditions\nand despite the gradual withdrawal of monetary accommodation. A sharp reversal in the pricing of risk\nwould have adverse effects on the corporate bond market and a sharp drop in commercial real estate\nprices could adversely affect the banking sector. Either would have implications for the real economy.\nThe reliance on short-term wholesale funding could exacerbate the problems, and with many of the\n\n15\n\nThe participating presidents were Eric Rosengren (FRB Boston and chair of the subcommittee at the time of the\nexercise), William Dudley (FRB New York), Esther George (FRB Kansas City), Narayana Kocherlakota (FRB\nMinneapolis), and Loretta Mester (FRB Cleveland). See Adrian, et al. (2015).\n\n\f10\nproviders of this funding outside of the supervisory purview of the Federal Reserve, it would be difficult\nto directly address this issue.\n\nThe objective of the exercise was for the policymaker participants to use available macroprudential tools\nand/or monetary policy to reduce the probability of and the severity of financial disruptions associated\nwith the scenario. The macroprudential tools considered included leverage ratios; countercyclical capital\nbuffers, which could vary across sectors; liquidity requirements; limits on loan-to-value and debt-toincome ratios; capital and liquidity stress testing; supervisory guidance; and moral suasion.\n\nAs the scenario played out, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated. The macroprudential\ntools that ended up being favored were stress testing, margins on repo funding, and supervisory guidance.\nCapital-based, liquidity-based, and loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, while good in theory, were\ndeemed to have implementation challenges, such as having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in\nsome cases, to follow administrative procedures like public comment periods, which would slow down\nthe process. Another limitation to some tools is that they applied to regulated banking firms but not\nnecessarily to shadow banks or other types of institutions.\n\nWhile my preference going into the exercise was, and continues to be, to start with the macroprudential\ntools that can be implemented more promptly, the limits on these tools suggest that, in some\ncircumstances, monetary policy might have to be used to address financial stability concerns. This is all\nthe more reason to take steps to ensure that the financial system is structurally resilient, as increased\nresiliency would lessen the need to shift some of monetary policy’s focus away from its macroeconomic\ngoals of price stability and maximum employment. In addition, we must continue to hone our methods of\nassessing financial system vulnerabilities – in both the regulated and unregulated sectors and between the\ntwo. We don’t want to over-identify such risks. Finding risks around every corner where none exist\nwould stifle productivity and innovation in the financial services sector and markets, and thereby\n\n\f11\nundermine longer-run economic growth. 16 This leads me to my final topic: the governance of financial\nstability policy.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\nThe complexity of the U.S. financial system, with multiple types of financial services providers and\nmultiple regulators, complicates the application of macroprudential policy. The multiple financial\nregulators in the U.S. include the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, the U.S. Treasury, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, there are regulatory\nagencies at the state level. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of\ninstitution rather than by instrument. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by\nthe Dodd-Frank Act to promote coordination and information sharing across these financial system\nregulators. Its membership includes the heads of the regulatory agencies, with the Secretary of the\nTreasury as chair. The Office of Financial Research (OFR), also established by the Dodd-Frank Act,\nsupports the FSOC and has been working to improve the data resources available to assess financial\nstability risks. This is particularly important as some segments of the financial system are less regulated\nthan others, e.g., hedge funds, and without data, it is difficult to ascertain emerging risks in these sectors.\nMoreover, even when data are collected, it is harder to track emerging risks to the extent that data aren’t\nstandardized across segments. 17\n\n16\n\nUsing a large group of countries, Rancière, Tornell, and Westermann (2008) find that average growth over 19602000 was higher in countries that have experienced occasional financial crises, as measured by the negative\nskewness of credit growth. They provide a model in which the enforceability of contracts plays an important role in\nengendering risk-taking and investment, which leads to higher growth.\n17\n\nOne of the FSOC’s priorities is to broaden the adoption by financial market participants of the Legal Entity\nIdentifier, which is a unique identifier for any entity participating in a financial transaction. See FSOC (2017).\n\n\f12\nEstablishing the FSOC and the OFR, and the regulatory changes to increase the structural resiliency of the\nfinancial system, including higher capital requirements and liquidity requirements, were important steps.\nStill, it has to be recognized that other than the ability to designate firms as systemically important\nfinancial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the Fed, the FSOC does not have\nthe authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can make recommendations to the\nagencies and to Congress, who can then decide to act or not. 18\n\nAs the tabletop exercise I just spoke of illuminated, regulatory and financial system complexity and the\nneed for coordination impose some limits on the efficacy of countercyclical macroprudential policy to\nmitigate financial stability risks that build up over time. If implementation is delayed so much that the\npolicies take effect after the risks are realized, at best, they would be ineffective and, at worst, they would\nexacerbate the situation rather than shore up the financial system. Moreover, unless the policies are\ncoordinated across the entire financial services landscape, they could result in regulatory arbitrage\nwhereby activities move to the sector with less stringent rules.\n\nThe need to be preemptive when wielding countercyclical macroprudential tools poses another challenge:\nthat of communication. The tools will have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability.\nThis might be difficult to explain, and there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be\ninvoked in seemingly good times. Thus, it’s important that policymakers have some independence in\nsetting macroprudential policy, with appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public. 19 This\nargues for transparency and regular testimony before Congress to explain the rationale behind policies.\n\n18\n19\n\nKohn (2014) compares and contrasts the financial stability structure in the U.S. with that in the U.K.\n\nKohn (2014) discusses the importance of the financial stability authority being able to pursue its goals\nindependent of short-run political considerations even when the actions taken aren’t popular.\n\n\f13\nThe FSOC and OFR annual reports, as well the materials included in the minutes of FOMC meetings and\nthe Board’s monetary policy report, all contribute to needed transparency. 20\n\nFinally, it is important to have a clearer understanding of how monetary policy and financial stability\npolicy should interact. Loose monetary policy, to the extent that it allows financial vulnerabilities to build\nup, can pose risks to financial stability when the monetary policy is reversed. And tightening\nmacroprudential rules to counteract growing imbalances can impede the flow of credit, thereby\ndampening economic growth.\n\nTabletop exercises like the one I described can be helpful in clarifying strategies for both monetary policy\nand financial stability policy. We are still some distance away from being able to articulate a clear\nstrategy about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a tool for financial\nstability. But progress on this will be important to provide clarity not only to the public but also to\nourselves as policymakers. As Kohn (2014) describes, the institutional structure in the U.K. has allowed\nit to be further along in this respect. In August 2013, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee\ninitiated forward guidance that it would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at\nleast until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent. 21 But it also said that one of the conditions that\nwould vacate this guidance would be if the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee found that the\nstance of monetary policy was threatening financial stability in a way that couldn’t be contained by the\navailable macroprudential tools. Note that both policy committees are within the Bank of England. The\ncommittees are independent but they also share members, which allows for good communication and\ninformation sharing between the two committees.\n\n20\n\nFor examples, see FOMC (2017), Board of Governors (2017), FSOC (2017) and OFR (2017a, 2017b).\n\n21\n\nSee Bank of England (2013).\n\n\f14\nIn the U.S., the FSOC should not play a similar role, as this would compromise the independence of\nmonetary policy decisions. This independence must be preserved because, as shown by a substantial\nbody of research and actual practice, when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run\npolitical interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result. Instead,\nthe Federal Reserve, itself, should work to make further progress on clarifying the strategies for the\ninteractions between monetary policy and financial stability policy. With the continued focus throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System on improving our ability to monitor emerging financial stability risks and on\ndeveloping tools and policies to address those risks, I am confident that such progress will be made.\n\n\f15\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macroprudential Policy: Case\nStudy from a Tabletop Exercise,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper RPA 15-1, September\n30, 2015, revised December 2015.\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/risk-and-policy-analysis/2015/macroprudential-policy-casestudy-from-a-tabletop-exercise.aspx)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series (FEDS) paper 2013-21, Divisions of Research and Statistics and\nMonetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board, March 2013.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf)\nAdrian, Tobias, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang, “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Annual Review of\nFinancial Economics, 7, December 2015, pp. 357-395.\n(http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-financial-111914-042008)\nAikman, David, Michael T.

Mester\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPanel Remarks for the National Association for Business Economics and\nAmerican Economic Association Session,\n“Coordinating Conventional and Unconventional Monetary Policies for Macroeconomic Stability”\nAllied Social Science Associations Annual Meeting\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 5, 2018\n\n\f1\nIntroduction\nI thank George Kahn for inviting me to speak in this session. I will use my time to discuss the framework\nthe FOMC uses for setting monetary policy and some alternative frameworks. Let me emphasize that this\nis a longer-run issue and not one that is of immediate concern. It lies in the realm of what economists and\npolicymakers should have on their agendas for study given the economic developments we’ve seen over\nthe past decade and what is expected over the coming decade. The views I’ll present are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\nThe FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework to set monetary policy. It is briefly\ndescribed in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. 1 The U.S. adopted\nan explicit numerical inflation goal in January 2012. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured\nby the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation.\nIn establishing this numerical goal, the U.S. joined many other countries, including Australia, Canada,\nNew Zealand, Sweden, and the U.K., as well as the European Central Bank, that conduct monetary policy\nwith a goal of achieving an explicit inflation target. An explicit target provides transparency to the public\nand helps anchor expectations about inflation. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. The flexible inflation-targeting framework recognizes that, over the\nlonger run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of\nthe economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary\npolicy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment.\n\nThe financial crisis and Great Recession imposed large economic costs on people and businesses. To\nfight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, Fed policymakers brought the policy rate to\n1\n\nSee FOMC (2017).\n\n\f2\neffectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and augmented their usual policy tools with\nunconventional tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. This was not business\nas usual. But now the economic expansion is firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and I expect that\ninflation, which has been running under our goal for quite some time, will return to our 2 percent goal on\na sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis economic environment is\nexpected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nAs I’ve discussed elsewhere, the expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation\nrates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of\nunemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate. 2 In fact, FOMC participants have been\nlowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price\nstability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8\npercent today. Empirical estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly\nuncertain, are lower than in the past. 3 So real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past\ndecades. If so, then there will be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative\neconomic shock than in the past. Said differently, the policy rate will have a higher chance of hitting the\nzero lower bound, necessitating the use of nontraditional monetary policy tools more often. To the extent\nthat these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained, the potential is\nfor longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate question of whether any\nchanges in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in\nthis environment. I’m not going to answer that question today. Nor am I going to discuss other\ngovernment policies that could be brought to bear to increase the long-term growth rate and equilibrium\ninterest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Instead, I’m going to outline four\n2\n3\n\nSee Mester (2017).\n\nFor FOMC projections, see FOMC (2014) and FOMC (2018). For a review of the literature on the equilibrium\ninterest rate, see Hamilton, et al. (2015).\n\n\f3\nalternative monetary policy frameworks that have received some attention and discuss some of their pros\nand cons.\n\nHigher Inflation Target\nOne alternative would be to set a higher inflation target, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent.4 Since the\nequilibrium nominal fed funds rate is the sum of the inflation target and the equilibrium real rate, a higher\ninflation target would offset a lower equilibrium real rate and so the nominal rate would be less likely to\nhit the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. One advantage of this framework is that it is very\nfamiliar because it is similar to the current framework. But there are also several challenges. First, the\ntransition could be difficult. The benefits of the higher target come only if the public views the increase\nas permanent so that inflation expectations rise to the new higher target. But inflation expectations are\nreasonably well anchored at 2 percent, so raising expectations would not necessarily be easy to do.\nSecond, a higher level of inflation may be associated with higher inflation volatility and with higher\ninflation risk premia, neither of which is desirable. Third, it isn’t clear whether an inflation rate at 4\npercent should be viewed as consistent with the Fed’s mandate of price stability. If, for this reason, one\nthen opted to raise the target to 3 percent instead, this would add only modest room for keeping the policy\nrate from the zero lower bound. And finally, one would need to evaluate whether the gain from avoiding\nthe zero lower bound when a negative shock hits the economy outweighs the costs of running a higher\nlevel of inflation at all times, remembering that much of the economy is not indexed to inflation.\n\nPrice-Level Targeting\nA second alternative framework involves targeting a path for the nominal level of prices rather than\ninflation, which is the growth rate of prices. Inflation targeting lets bygones-be-bygones: it does not\nmake up for past deviations of inflation from target. Instead, the inflation-targeting policymaker just tries\n4\n\nSee Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) for discussion.\n\n\f4\nto bring inflation back to target. For example, if inflation has run low for a time (so that the price level\nfalls below its targeted price path), the inflation-targeting policymaker would aim to move the inflation\nrate back up to its target rate and allow the price level to remain at a level permanently below its targeted\npath. In contrast, price-level targeting makes up for past deviations of the price level from its path. 5 If\ninflation has run low so that the price level has fallen below its targeted path, the price-level targeter\nwould try to move the price level back up to path, and this would entail inflation running high for a while.\nSimilarly, if inflation had been running high, the inflation targeter would aim to bring it down to target,\nwhile a price-level targeter would aim to bring the price level back down to its targeted path, which would\nmean inflation would be low for a while.\n\nThus, the price-level-targeting framework builds in a form of forward commitment, thereby affecting\ncurrent economic conditions. When inflation has been running low, the framework builds in a “low for\nlonger” interest-rate strategy, as the policymaker would keep rates low for longer until the price level\nmoved back to its targeted path. The anticipation of higher inflation in the future should move inflation\nexpectations up, and this would tend to buoy the current level of inflation and shorten the amount of time\nthe economy spends at the zero lower bound, therefore yielding better outcomes than inflation targeting.\nIn fact, the academic literature suggests that a price-level-targeting framework may approximate optimal\nmonetary policy when policymakers want to minimize fluctuations in the output gap and in inflation\naround a target, and it can be particularly useful at the zero lower bound by putting upward pressure on\ninflation expectations and, thereby, downward pressure on the real rate. 6 Before I talk about some\nchallenges, let me discuss a third related framework: nominal GDP targeting.\n\n5\n\nSee Kahn (2009) for a discussion of price-level targeting.\n\n6\n\nSee Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n\n\f5\nNominal GDP Targeting\nThis framework is similar to price-level targeting in that it targets the level of nominal GDP rather than\nthe growth rate. Of course, nominal GDP comprises real GDP and inflation, so this framework explicitly\nincorporates both parts of the Fed’s mandate. For example, targeting the level of nominal GDP to be on a\npath rising by 4 percent per year would be consistent with 2 percent inflation and 2 percent potential\ngrowth. This strategy, like price-level targeting, makes up for past deviations. But it may perform better\nthan price-level targeting when there are supply shocks to which the policymaker would not want to\nrespond because such supply shocks tend to push prices and real output in opposite directions, leaving\nnominal income stable.\n\nWhile both price-level and nominal GDP targeting have the benefit of building in some forward\ncommitment, which is useful at the zero lower bound, there would be some challenges in implementing\neither framework. First, there is little international experience with such frameworks to assess how they\nwould work in practice. 7 Second, for frameworks targeting levels instead of growth rates, the starting\npoint matters, and these frameworks are complicated by other measurement issues as well. For example,\nFigure 1 shows the price-level path using four different starting points: the first quarters of 1990, 1995,\n2001, and 2007. As you can see on the left-hand side of the chart, if the starting point is 1990Q1, the\nprice level is essentially on its path, and if the starting point is 2001Q1, it is near its path. The other two\nstarting points, on the right-hand side of the chart, show a larger gap.\n\nMoreover, because the level-targeting frameworks do not let bygones-be-bygones, data revisions pose a\nmore serious issue than they do with inflation targeting (see Figure 2), and are perhaps greater for\nnominal GDP targeting than price-level targeting because revisions to nominal GDP tend to be larger than\n\n7\n\nSweden did price-level targeting for less than two years when it went off the gold standard in 1931. See Kahn\n(2009).\n\n\f6\nrevisions to prices. Also, the path of the nominal GDP target depends on estimates of potential real\noutput growth. If the nominal income target incorporates an unrealistically high estimate of potential\ngrowth, then inflation will need to be higher in order to hit the target.\n\nA third complication, and perhaps the largest, for frameworks targeting nominal levels is that the benefits\ndepend on the public’s not only understanding the framework but believing that future Committees will\nfollow through. Explaining this unfamiliar framework to the public could be difficult. One also has to\nask whether it is a credible commitment on the part of policymakers to keep interest rates low to make up\nfor past shortfalls even when demand is growing strongly or to act to bring inflation down in the face of a\nsupply shock by tightening policy even in the face of weak demand. If it is not credible that policymakers\nwill do so, then the benefits of nominal level targeting will not be realized.\n\nThe final framework I’ll discuss was suggested by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and is a hybrid\nbetween inflation targeting and price-level targeting, which tries to capture the advantages of each while\nminimizing the challenges. 8\n\nTemporary Price-Level Targeting\nUnder the temporary price-level-targeting framework, monetary policymakers would target inflation in\nnormal times, but when the policy rate fell to the zero lower bound, they would begin targeting the price\nlevel from that starting point. Under this framework, consistent with optimal monetary policy,\npolicymakers would have a more powerful commitment at the zero lower bound than would be the case\nunder inflation targeting. Switching to price-level targeting at the zero lower bound means that policy\nwould be kept at zero at least until the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound had\n\n8\n\nBernanke (2017).\n\n\f7\nbeen reached had risen back to target. Once policymakers were satisfied that this goal had been met, the\npolicy rate could begin to rise and policymakers would revert to targeting inflation.\n\nThis framework has benefits similar to those of price-level targeting in that when monetary policy is not\nable to provide more stimulus because it is constrained by the zero lower bound, the framework builds in\na forward commitment of easier monetary policy in the future. But this hybrid framework could be easier\nto communicate because it could be discussed solely in terms of the inflation goal (see Figure 3). It\nwould also mean that some of the commitment problems of nominal level targeting, including having to\nmake up for supply shocks that would temporarily raise inflation even if aggregate demand were low,\ncould be avoided when away from the zero lower bound because policymakers would be targeting\ninflation and not the price level there. However, a drawback of the hybrid approach is that determining\nand communicating the timing of when to switch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex.\nPolicymakers would not want to switch back prematurely, so they would need to be sure that inflation had\nsustainably made up for the cumulative shortfall. This would seem to involve a considerable amount of\ndiscretion, which would undermine some of the benefits of the framework.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, there are several alternative monetary policy frameworks that potentially offer some benefits\nin a low interest rate environment. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges and we\nwill need to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives would outweigh those of the\nflexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use in the U.S. and in many other countries. Each\nframework is worthy of further study, and now may be an appropriate time to undertake such study\nbecause the economy is growing, labor markets are strong, and inflation is projected to move back to our\ngoal.\n\n\f8\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., “Temporary Price-Level Targeting: An Alternative Framework for Monetary Policy,”\nBen Bernanke’s Blog, The Brookings Institution, October 12, 2017.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2017/10/12/temporary-price-level-targeting-analternative-framework-for-monetary-policy/)\nBlanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, and Paolo Mauro, “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 42(s1), 2010, pp. 199-215.\n(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00334.x/full)\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary\nPolicy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139-233.\n(https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-zero-bound-on-interest-rates-and-optimal-monetary-policy/)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 2014,” April 2014.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20140319.pdf)\nFOMC, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 12-13, 2017,” January 2018.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20171213.pdf)\nFOMC, “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” January 31, 2017.\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf)\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.
